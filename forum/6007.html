For heaven's sake, man! Can't you see we're trying to<br/>
keep this as uneducational as possible? And here you<br/>
come along with...a QUESTION! Ah!<br/>
<br/>
Are you asking for where the kana spacings are? or are<br/>
you looking for the kanji? I've got to be honest, I've<br/>
never seen the kanji...and just now typing it into the<br/>
computer, none came out that I would recognize as<br/>
having anything to do with either the current or<br/>
original meanings. BUT, if I'm not entirely off my<br/>
rocker today, I believe it's sa-yo-na-ra. It could be<br/>
sa-yo-u-na-ra, but I don't *THINK* it is. I think I<br/>
just unintentionally lengthen the *yo* out of habit.<br/>
And wouldn't you know I'd left all my dictionaries at<br/>
home today. <br/>

 </span></blockquote>It is indeed "sa yo u na ra." There are no kanji, as it's a colloquism <br/>
(from sa [thus] you [like] nara [if]) a contraction of sayounaraba (lit. <br/>
"If it must be thus...") which is also near cousin to the popular <br/>
samurai drama "ciao baby" term "saraba" (from sa araba).<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Dang it. There I go thinking again. I knew it was a<br/>
colloquism, and roughly had the meaning, but dang. I<br/>
sometimes forget what is "o" and is "ou", which is the<br/>
one fault I found to studying in Nagoya. I still say<br/>
"Arigato" instead of "Arigatou". <br/>
