<div id="ygrps-yiv-1247773172">if i recall, we've discussed the role of bushido before. It wasn't for keeping the samurai down, but for keeping them "up." That is, in a society without any wars, if you have a military class, you have to have some rational or emotional justification for continuing their benefits. Bushido made the samurai out to be more than just a soldier, and so attempted (I guess successfully) to justify his existence in the non-warring period. Kinda like for america, if we don't have any perceived military threats, we want to cut military spending. So what does the military do? Come up with all the "be all you can be" and "army of one" and "we're looking for a few good men" advertising campaigns... which glorifies the military in the public's eye, and gives it a purpose apart from war... namely the bettering of our citizens by education and experience. Bushido made samurai out to be "honorable citizens" or something to that effect...<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1046649255">Kinda like for america, if we don't have any perceived military <br/>
threats, we want to cut military spending. So what does the military <br/>
do? Come up with all the "be all you can be" and "army of one" and <br/>

apart from war... namely the bettering of our citizens by education <br/>
and experience. Bushido made samurai out to be "honorable citizens" <br/>
or something to that effect...<br/>
<br/>
I have to disagree with you here.  The military does not come up with <br/>
advertising campaigns to glorify the military in the public's eye.  <br/>
How does spending more of the military budget on advertising give the <br/>
military any more money.  A portion of the budget is allotted to <br/>
recruit and retain personnel through these campaigns.  This was an <br/>
important issue about 5 years ago.  The military branches were all <br/>
significantly under mandated strength numbers.<br/>
<br/>
If you want to cut military spending (or more aptly if congress wants <br/>
to do so) there isn't much the military can do about it.  Congress <br/>
makes laws about force budgets and limitaions on force strength (the <br/>
number of personnel in each branch).  Perception is an important <br/>
issue and some people do percieve that we aren't in need of a <br/>
military.  Perceptions are not always the truth.  Your perception and <br/>
my perception may be completely different.  <br/>
<br/>
Relating back to the samurai, there is always a need for military <br/>
power.  In the samurai days it may have been for civil obedience <br/>
outside the existance of a war.  As for America's military, I'd <br/>
challenge you to name a period in recent history that they weren't <br/>
invovled in some conflict.  U.S. forces have been reduced by more <br/>
than half.  The military performs the same job with less people. The  <br/>
military also serves the purpose of civil protection, aid natural <br/>
disaster victims, and any other emergency of national or local <br/>
importance. <br/>
<br/>
 The U.S. military is very different from the samurai.  Japan was <br/>
isolated from most of the world.  By their own choice and because of <br/>
geography.  The U.S. military deals with global issues.  A military <br/>
dealing only with its own country's problems has different demands. <br/>
In which case your second assertion may bear some truth.  Only some <br/>
truth becuase I believe the samurai were in a postion like many <br/>
dictatorships in the world.  They possessed the frightening might or <br/>
the military and didn't require justifying themselves to the <br/>
population they ruled.  If the peasants didn't like it; what would <br/>
they do about it?  They odd situation with Japan is that they had 2 <br/>
positions of power.  Shogun and Emperor.  Periods existed when the <br/>
Emperor possessed all the power and there were times when the Emperor <br/>
was only a puppet.  The peasants were'nt the only ones who didn't <br/>
like the system.  The Emperor didn't and he did something about it.  <br/>
No matter how the samurai class may have been "justified" the Emperor <br/>
decided that the weren't needed and that a new military needed to be <br/>
formed to progress the nation into modern times.  <br/>
<br/>
Important to note that he still thought a military was important just <br/>
not the one they had.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1729106331">Brandon, I don't know what your motivation is in disagreeing with me. I think I've only stated the obvious. It's not like I made any giant assuming leaps. First of all, I said "kinda like"... not EXACTLY like. Second of all, YES the military advertises itself to build up its image so it can maintain its numbers AND get more money from Congress. It's not like the two things are completely separate. Third, as for there "always" being a need for military... I never said there wasn't. But the need is greater or lesser at any given time when compared with other times, and certainly PERCEIVED to be greater or lesser at any given time. In a time of "perceived" lesser need, spending gets cut. <br/>
<br/>
 My point was just that without all the civil wars to fight, the role of the samurai changed. <br/>

<h3>Re:role of bushido</h3>
by <i>midorinotoradesu</i>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-308373120">I agreed with you on one point and only disagreed with your opinion <br/>
toward the American military.  The purpose of the advertising <br/>
campaigns are to get peopel to join.  You may be right that they <br/>
aren't completly seperate.  While they may also convince others that <br/>
the military is a good thing that is not their primary purpose.  What <br/>
really justifies the military is the contingencies we are involved <br/>
in, the honorable behavior of the men and women who serve, and the <br/>
family members/friends who support the U.S. citizen soldiers in <br/>
service.  I don't believe that congress has ever voted the military a <br/>
payraise because some constituant wrote their congress person, who <br/>
was so completely moved by a commercial.  "Dog gonnit, that Army of <br/>
one thing is pretty snappy.  The military needs more money.  I'm <br/>
writing my congressman."  Supporters of the military have been: those <br/>
who have served themselves, those who have family or friends serving, <br/>
or those who wish they could have served.<br/>
<br/>
Now don't get me wrong, I'm not attacking YOU.  You have valid points <br/>
and I did agree that early Japan may have attempted to justify the <br/>
samurai class by changing their role.  You are entitled to an <br/>
opinion.  In this case, I think I may be closer to the issue and may <br/>
be more informed.  I have not based what I told you purely on <br/>
speculation.  I know how some of the money is budgeted and why they <br/>
use it a certain way.  Any communication may serve multiple purposes <br/>
but not all those purposes were the driving factor for creating the <br/>
communication.  You believe that the military advertises to get more <br/>
money.  It doesn't hurt my feelings that you think that.  In some <br/>
round about way, the military may get more money.  But the purpose of <br/>
those advertising campaigns is to recruit.  I don't know if it could <br/>
be more obvious, since the end of those commercials tell you to <br/>
contact a recruiter not a congress person.<br/>
<br/>
Back to the topic.  Samurai didn't have to worry about advertising <br/>
campaigns and raising money from the public.  They were in the <br/>
samurai class.  They didn't need more people in it and they didn't <br/>
require the support of the general public to get paid.<br/>

EXACTLY like. Second of all, YES the military advertises itself to <br/>
build up its image so it can maintain its numbers AND get more money <br/>
from Congress. It's not like the two things are completely separate. <br/>
Third, as for there "always" being a need for military... I never <br/>
said there wasn't. But the need is greater or lesser at any given <br/>
time when compared with other times, and certainly PERCEIVED to be <br/>
greater or lesser at any given time. In a time of "perceived" lesser <br/>

<h3>Re:role of bushido</h3>
by <i>midorinotoradesu</i>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1097673332"> But really, I'm not campaigning. I have not aligned myself with any<br/>
partisan candidate or party. I simply feel obligigated to defend the<br/>
U.S. military against speculation. Mostly because I want to believe<br/>
that the military is doing right. I brought up President Bush only<br/>
because he is the head of the military. Commander in Chief. I<br/>
believe that his motivations for the war were just. Congress thought<br/>
so. Congress declared war.<br/>
<br/>
Unlike the samurai, the U.S. military citizens do need to have a<br/>
place in the hearts of the public. The military and the public are<br/>
the same people. The U.S. does not have a military class. Since<br/>
citizen soldiers are no different than other citizens there is a<br/>
desire to be accepted. America learned that the military needs the<br/>
public as a result of the Vietnam conflict.<br/>
