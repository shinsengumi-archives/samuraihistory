<h3>Japanese Date Converter</h3>

<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-2121794466">Version 1.01 of the Japanese Date Converter is finally complete and <br/>
available for download in the Downloads section of the Samurai <br/>
Archives Japanese History page <br/>
(www.techjapanese.com/samurai/downloads.html). This updated version <br/>
will convert the Japanese Era names and numbers to the 'western' year <br/>
equivalents as well as the 'western' year to the Japanese era name <br/>
and number equivalents. It isn't case sensitive, and long 'O' and 'U' <br/>
sounds can be written as either 'o' and 'ou' or 'u' and 'uu' <br/>
respectively. The Japanese 'N' can also be written as 'm' where such <br/>
a substitution would be logically possible. Apostrophe's can be <br/>
omitted after the "N" or left in. Either way. <br/>
This version also corrected a few minor mistakes that came up in the <br/>
original. Let me know if there are any problems with, or mistakes in <br/>
this version. <br/>
