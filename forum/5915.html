<h3>Scroll creation</h3>
by <i>msr_iaidoka</i>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1182606415">Greetings all,<br/>
<br/>
  I am sending this to multiple lists so I appologize in advance for any <br/>
multiple posts.<br/>
<br/>
  I have recently commissioned a friend of mine who is a Shodou student to <br/>
do some Kanji work for me.  However, she does not know how to construct the <br/>
scrolls once the work has been done on the rice paper.  Does anyone on here <br/>
know how to properly construct a scroll?  Any assistance that you can offer <br/>
will be muchly appreciated.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Peace,<br/>
<br/>

 </span></blockquote>I've only made one, it was not a great job. That was no fault of the teacher who was an expert. It's not something you will probably get right the first time. You can get them mounted in the US probably for $100-200 each. So if the work is valuable or a gift you probably want to pay a pro or practice several times with it before mounting them. I'm away from my books for a few days so I can't give really good references now. Some stores listed here though:<br/>

<br/>
I'm also experimenting with unconventional mounting methods that use iron activated interfacing material found in fabric stores. It's a lot less messy and tedious than the conventional wet mounting methods and irons are used in traditional Japanese bookmaking so it might last a while. I have not developed the procedure fully yet.<br/>
