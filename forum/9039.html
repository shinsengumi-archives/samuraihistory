<h3>Samurai Fiction Contest 2007</h3>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-23975896">The webpage for the third annual Samurai Fiction contest is now live:<br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.samurai-archives.com/writcon2.html">http://www.samurai-archives.com/writcon2.html</a><br/>
<br/>
This year, I'm sticking with the genres idea, with the addition that<br/>
this year, for every 5 stories entered, I will add an additional $50<br/>
to the prize winnings - so it is in all the entrants best interest to<br/>
try to get as many people to join as possible.  Also, between now and<br/>
September 15th, the entry fee is only $7 - it will go up to $10 after<br/>
that.  Below is a general description of the details, however, check<br/>
the webpage noted above for more detailed information:<br/>
<br/>
Third Annual Samurai Fiction Contest, 2007<br/>
<br/>
The parameters for the third annual Samurai Fiction contest are<br/>
covered on this page. The stories must involve Japan or the Samurai,<br/>
and the story may take place any time up to, but no later than the end<br/>
of the 19th century, and may take place at any point in Japanese<br/>
history before this.<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
Requirements:<br/>
<br/>
This is to be a piece of fiction writing taking place within an<br/>
unspecified period in Japanese history up to the late 19th century.<br/>
The available genres are listed below, or along the window on the left<br/>
of this page - the stories must be written in the style of one of the<br/>
genres on the listed.<br/>
<br/>
Parameters:<br/>
<br/>
The story is required to be more than 1,000 words, with a 5,000 word<br/>
targeted limit - overages are acceptable if necessary, but please<br/>
don't overdo it. It can be done in the first person, or the third<br/>
person, and must be a complete short story, not an excerpt from a<br/>
larger story. The genre(s) must be listed at the top of the story<br/>
above the title - one genre or a combination of two genres are<br/>
acceptable. Although the particular genre will not affect judging, all<br/>
entrants must make sure that their story follows the requirements of<br/>
their chosen genre(s) - see details below.<br/>
<br/>
Sequels: Sequels to previous stories entered in the contest are<br/>
acceptable - however, the story must be a stand-alone short story, not<br/>
a continuation of the previous story.<br/>
<br/>
Entrance Fee and Prize Details:<br/>
<br/>
The entrance fee depends on when you sign up for the contest:<br/>
<br/>
The current fee is $7<br/>
<br/>
If you sign up for the contest between September 16th and December<br/>
31st, 2006, the fee will be $10.<br/>
<br/>
If you sign up for the contest between January 1st and the deadline of<br/>
March 31st, 2007, the fee will be $15.<br/>
<br/>
So it is to your advantage to sign up early.<br/>
<br/>
Additionally, for every five entries, the Samurai Archives will add<br/>
$50 to the winnings.<br/>
<br/>
The fee is payable via PAYPAL (www.paypal.com), payable to: webmaster<br/>
@ samurai-archives.com. Be sure to include your full name, and Yahoo<br/>
ID, Samurai Archives Citadel ID, and Delphi Forums ID (please list any<br/>
and all that you have, omit any you don't - this is so we can keep<br/>
track of entries) when you pay the entrance fee, and note that the<br/>
payment is for the 2007 Samurai Fiction contest. You will receive a<br/>
confirmation email that your submission has been received.<br/>
Why an entrance fee? Because the winner of the contest will win 80% of<br/>
the total sum of all fees collected, the runner up will win the<br/>
remaining 20%. Additionally, as stated before, for every 5 entries,<br/>
the Samurai Archives will add an additional $50 to the total winnings.<br/>
Note: Entrance fees are non-refundable, so if you pay the fee, be sure<br/>
to send in a story, as the fees will stay as part of the total the<br/>
winner will receive.<br/>
If you do not have a credit card or paypal account but still want to<br/>
enter, please send an email to webmaster @ samurai-archives.com about<br/>
sending a money order.<br/>
<br/>
Submission Information:<br/>
<br/>
Submissions are to be sent via email to webmaster @<br/>
samurai-archives.com in a WORD .Doc format OR HTML. At the top of the<br/>
first page, please include your full name, your Yahoo ID, Samurai<br/>
Archives Citadel ID, and your Delphi Forums ID (whichever is<br/>
applicable) so it can be matched with your entrance fee, as well as<br/>
the genre(s) the story falls under, and the title of your story. You<br/>
will receive a confirmation email that your submission has been received.<br/>
<br/>
Judging and Winning the contest:<br/>
<br/>
Submissions will be judged by a panel of Yahoo Group and Samurai<br/>
Citadel community members who are not submitting stories. The judges<br/>
will not be told who the authors of each respective submision are<br/>
until after the judging has closed, to avoid any swaying of the<br/>
judges. The recipient of the submissions (The Samurai Archives<br/>
webmaster) will not be a judge, and will only moderate the<br/>
proceedings, to keep entries anonymous. The winner will receive the<br/>
total of all collected entrance fees, and the winning story will be<br/>
featured on the Samurai Archives site as the winner of the 2007<br/>
Samurai Fiction contest. All stories will be placed in the 'Fan<br/>
Fiction' section of the Samurai Archives as well. The winner will be<br/>
announced at the Yahoo Group and the Samurai Citadel at the end of<br/>
judging. <br/>
<br/>
Deadline for entrance fee: 3/31/2007<br/>
Deadline for fiction submission: 4/05/2007<br/>
Judging starts: 4/10/2007<br/>
Judging ends: 4/15/2007 or until necessary<br/>
Winner to be announced after judging.<br/>
