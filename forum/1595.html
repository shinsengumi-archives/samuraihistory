<div id="ygrps-yiv-1137582789">Hey there.<br/>
  I don't know about popular, and interesting, I think is a matter of <br/>
preference.  But as far as I know (which isn't much), the most documented <br/>
would be any of the major warlords: Oda Nobunaga, Toyotomi Hideyoshi and <br/>
Tokugawa Ieyasu certainly would be on that list, as well might be the Date, <br/>
Takeda and Uesugi warlords and the Mori possibly.  Thats about the best I can <br/>
do, but maybe someone else has more answers than I do.<br/>
<br/>
Later.<br/>
