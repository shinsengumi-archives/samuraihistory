shaken. (Would anyone care to translate the two terms literally?  I'd be<br/>

Sha-Ken means "sword that is shaped like a wheel" (車券).<br/>
<br/>
Personally I've never heard them expressed as opposing terms. In my <br/>
experience, shaken are a type of shuriken. Some shuriken are shaped <br/>
like needles. These are called 'bou-shuriken' which basically means <br/>
'stick shuriken'. Some shuriken are shaped like stars. These are <br/>
shaken. But that is my limited understanding. I could very well be <br/>
misinformed.<br/>

<br/>
original shuriken started off as stones and in some<br/>
cases an item called Tsubute<br/>
<br/>
the spike you refer to is callled Bo-shuriekn (stick<br/>
shuriken) this is as you say a spike - maybe nothing<br/>
more than a nail in some cases.<br/>
<br/>
Shaken are spikes as you say and these may have been<br/>
devleoped in later years.<br/>
<br/>
Shaken take very little training to aquire some skill.<br/>
however Bo-shuriken do take serious study if you wish<br/>
to study many different avenues of this field.<br/>
<br/>
If you really wish to readmore about shuriken I<br/>
suggest that you start with this web page<br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.aikidoaus.com.au/dojo/shuriken/">http://www.aikidoaus.com.au/dojo/shuriken/</a><br/>
<br/>
The book spike and chain by R Gruzanki is an<br/>
interesting book. you can read about the origin of the<br/>
book and its author and nawa sensei who features in<br/>
the book at this site run by his son<br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.robertg.com/">http://www.robertg.com/</a><br/>
<br/>
from what i gather Masaki ryu does not really teach<br/>
shuriken<br/>
<br/>
there are many ryu that still teach shuriken in japan<br/>
today. One excellent video is made by the Nippon<br/>
Budokan on the Negishi Ryu<br/>

is the word for ticket...can that be right?<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Hahaha. No you're right it's a typo - good catch. The two words <br/>
are homophones.<br/>
<br/>
As you say, 車剣 is the right word - not 車券.<br/>
<br/>
This is a kind of typo called &#22793;&#25563;&#12511;&#12473;. It's quite easy to do <br/>
(although it is sloppy and I shouldn't have done it) when typing <br/>
in Japanese.<br/>
