<h3>fortifications</h3>

Society of Ancient magazine Slingshot had a recent article on Japanese<br/>
fortifications.<br/>
Turnbulls Samurai Warfare book also has some interesting information<br/>
along with at least one of his other books, but I forget which off hand.<br/>
<br/>
When I was in Japan I bought a plastic model kit of Matsumoto castle<br/>
which is helpful.<br/>
<br/>
I remember recently looking through a bibliography and seeing a number<br/>
of references to books on castles, and it is on my list of things to<br/>
reference as well.<br/>
Logically thinking, its probably in the slingshot article so I will<br/>
check. <br/>
<br/>
Hope that helps<br/>
<br/>
Kind regards<br/>
<br/>

To all out there<br/>
During my latest vacation in Japan, I spent rather a<br/>
lot of time (well spent) and money visiting a number<br/>
of fortifications on Honshu .  It sparked a new area<br/>
of interest for me and thus I'd appreciate any info in<br/>
regards to where I can acquire quality material on the<br/>
history of Japanese castles, since trawling a number<br/>
of large bookstores in Tokyo and Osaka presented with<br/>
nothing (in English).<br/>
All info appreciated<br/>
