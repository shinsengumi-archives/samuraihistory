<div id="ygrps-yiv-947466916">Curious. How is Hollywoods/advertisment/news media of USA attacking<br/>
males? <br/>
 <br/>
Though this sort of conversation probably belongs in a different<br/>
forum/list involving contemporary U.S. politics. <br/>
 <br/>
I don't think that this has anything at all to do with the Buke<br/>
(Samurai) class being abolished in late 19th century Japan. <br/>
 <br/>
Oh, and you mentioned "USA Samurai?" There are no such thing as samurai<br/>
in the USA. Samurai were members of the Buke class in Japan who served<br/>
daimyo (feudal lords), from around the 10th century until 1867, when the<br/>
Buke class was abolished.<br/>

<br/>
When the Samurai were not needed anymore...they were discarded. <br/>
Likewise the USA's media is discarding males...any significance?<br/>
<br/>
In other words, is not Hollywoods/advertisment/news media of USA<br/>
attacks on males= the end of USA Samurai? If this question is out of <br/>
place, kindly delete. <br/>
