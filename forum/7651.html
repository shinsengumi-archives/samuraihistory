"Everything old is new again."<br/>
<br/>
"It's like deja vu all over again."<br/>
<br/>
"Those who ignore history are doomed to repeat it."<br/>
<br/>
The English language is filled with sayings about the circular <br/>
nature of existence. We just cannot seem to break free of the desire <br/>
to revisit themes or events that we have experienced before. Just <br/>
think of that cousin that kept doing the same dumb thing over and <br/>
over again. So what does all of this have to do with anime?<br/>
<br/>
Well, in Akira Kurosawa's Samurai 7, we are treated to <br/>
a "reimagining" of the classic tale of conflict between seven <br/>
honorable warriors and the fallen nobles turned thieves that prey <br/>
upon the helpless. But this update is an uncomfortable marriage of <br/>
old and new. Wars are fought with huge flying fortresses and cyborg <br/>
samurai but everyone still uses swords. Society is technologically <br/>
advanced but still uses rice as currency. It all looks great but <br/>
there is very little explanation why a world with huge Matrix-like <br/>
machines would also look like feudal Japan. Which brings us back to <br/>
the "everything old is new again" theme. <br/>
<br/>
In the recent Steamboy, Katsuhiro Otomo (Akira) conceived a <br/>
Victorian London filled with amazing modern machines all powered by <br/>
steam. He went to great lengths to make the viewer believe that all <br/>
the gears and boilers worked to achieve the results. In Osamu <br/>
Tezuka's Metropolis, mechanical people and fantastic machinery exist <br/>
believably in world vaguely set in the roaring '20s. And we would be <br/>
remiss in not mentioning the works of Leji Matsumoto (Star Blazers, <br/>
Queen Emeraldas, Captin Harlock, Galaxy Railways) where WWII <br/>
battleships, pirate ships and steam engine trains all zip across <br/>
space. The point is that all of these series combine old with new <br/>
but make it believable. Unfortunately, Samurai 7 doesn't quite <br/>
succeed at that.<br/>
<br/>
Which is not to say that this is a bad series. Gonzo (Last Exile, <br/>
Kiddy Grade, Blue Submarine No. 6) has done a remarkable job. 3D and <br/>
traditional animation have been seamlessly combined and the artwork <br/>
is superb. The characters range widely in style though, with the <br/>
leads lovingly drawn while supporting characters can be quite <br/>
unusual in appearance. The background audio is a subtle but <br/>
effective mix of traditional Japanese instruments and modern pieces <br/>
that convey the mood perfectly. Also, the script has been nicely <br/>
adapted, keeping Kurosawa's unique combination of action, drama and <br/>
humor. There is plenty of all three and no anime fan will be <br/>
disappointed with this series.<br/>
<br/>
As a DVD, Samurai 7 soars. Funimation has given this title loving <br/>
attention and it shows. The English cast is perfect - the voices are <br/>
just what you'd expect when you first see the characters. Even <br/>
challenging characters such as the cyborg samurai Kikuchiyo come <br/>
across great. <br/>
<br/>
The video is presented in 16:9 widescreen format and the sound comes <br/>
in immersive English and Japanese 5.1 or standard English and <br/>
Japanese stereo. The disc and packaging come chock full of extras as <br/>
well. The case includes a great action painting of the samurai in <br/>
action running the full width of the interior and a hefty book full <br/>
of interviews and artwork. The disc offers character profiles, <br/>
promotional videos (including a five-minute piece that gives much of <br/>
the new story's background), an image gallery, textless songs and <br/>
Funimation trailers. It is all very cleanly executed though some of <br/>
the menus are so subtle that they are bit difficult to navigate.<br/>
<br/>
One minor bone to pick with Funimation - their recent discs have <br/>
come with long promotional videos for other titles that play before <br/>
the menu appears. On the Samurai 7 disc, that meant spending 1 <br/>
minute and 30 seconds watching a promo that cannot be skipped over <br/>
before the menu appeared. The promos were nice but having the option <br/>
to skip over them would have been even nicer.<br/>
<br/>
Overall, Akira Kurosawa's Samurai 7 is an ideal sci-fi/action <br/>
adventure. It has cool heros, nasty nasties and plenty of stuff to <br/>
look at. Just don't try to explain why the super science is <br/>
there...it just is. <br/>
