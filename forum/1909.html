<h3>mongol invasions film</h3>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1225867363">hello group,<br/>
                       can anyone tell me has there ever been a film made about the mongol invasions of japan in the thirteenth century?<br/>
If so can someone give me the title,name of director,year it was releasted and can I get it with english sub-title's.<br/>
If not what a topic for a film.It could start with a brief history on the conquest's of the great kahn and how his eye's turned east.<br/>
First china and then korea fell under his power.How he then sent envoy's to the japanese court telling them he was a god and how they should surrender to him.The japanese sending the head's of these envoy's back as their answer.<br/>
How the Hojo family united the other family's for the defence of japan and the construction of the sea wall.<br/>
I could go on about the subject,but most of you know of it....so that do you think???<br/>
Special effects these day's could easily come up with a typhoon and destroy a fleet of hundred's of ships.<br/>
<br/>
                                                              your's Ray<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-412421519">Your best bet would be to see NHK's 2001 Taiga Drama 'Hojo Tokimune'. This<br/>
fifty episode?miniseries followed the life of the Hojo Shikken Tokimune plus<br/>
gave considerable time showing the Mongol side as well. The battle scenes<br/>
near the end were quite good. I could tape the entire series from TV. I know<br/>
that a condensed version (about four hours) is available on tape and DVD<br/>
here in Japan. What might be available in your area I don't know. Other<br/>
posters to this forum have said some of these Taiga Drama's are available in<br/>
some areas of the states.<br/>
<br/>
Another film about this subject is called 'The Divine Wind Blows' (Japanese<br/>
title 'Kakute Shinpu wo Fuku') made in 1944. Its mostly propaganda, made<br/>
near the end of World war II. The copy I saw was pretty well worn. The sound<br/>
and picture were of poor quality. I have not seen this on video or DVD. The<br/>
copy I have was shown on TV some time ago. Better to see the NHK version.</div>
