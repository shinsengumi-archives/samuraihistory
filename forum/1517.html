 </span></blockquote>I agree, most of them by modern standards were thugs and killers. I'm <br/>
talking more about the ideal knight, who is supposed to protect those <br/>
weaker than himself, practice charity, and otherwise act like a decent <br/>
sort of guy. These are ideals that were put forward by bards and others <br/>
in that period. Also there is quite a bit of difference between <br/>
face/shame cultures and guilt/sin cultures and I'm hopelessly Western in <br/>
my outlook towards these two approaches. Now in reality it's never that <br/>
clearcut, but I'm only talking about perfection here, something I've <br/>
never really approached closely except for idiocy.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>He some ways he should, Kurosawa was a great director, his earlier films <br/>
were excellent and not just the chanbara ones. Rent High and Low from a <br/>
video store if possible or some of the other films he made in the middle <br/>
of his career. Still won't mind seeing Heaven and Earth one time. Even <br/>
bad chanbara is better that the best Hollywood teen comedy.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>How about in Japanese? It might be closer to on topic. Better still <br/>
fuedal period Japanese. There might be one or two on the list that could <br/>
read it! ^_^ Happier than my current reading assignment at least, <br/>
Chinmoku, where I get to learn all the delightful words for torture, <br/>
pain and suffering and the happy fate of the Christians in Japan.<br/>
