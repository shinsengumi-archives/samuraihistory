Everyone knows Nobunaga was a pioneer in <br/>
the unification of Japan - but what were <br/>
 his motives?  I've created a little <br/>
poll to get everyone's opinions - What <br/>
was Nobunaga's motivation for the <br/>
unification battles of Japan? <br/>
<br/>
  o Pure self interest from the start. <br/>
  o An honest to goodness feeling of loyalty and duty to his country. <br/>
  o Self interest at first, which grew into a sense of duty. <br/>
  o Started with a sense of duty to Japan, but grew into a selfish drive for power. <br/>
  o Just happened to be good at winning and politics, and sort of 'fell into it'. <br/>
  o Pushed by his generals and vassals to achieve. <br/>
  o Reveled in death and destruction - unification would only be a side effect of his bloodlust. <br/>
  o Was part of a grand conspiracy among daimyo and the emperor as the 'chosen one' to lead Japan. <br/>
  o He enjoyed the thrill of battle and the thrill of political intrigue. <br/>
  o Wanted nothing more than power over others. <br/>
  o Fought out of loyalty to the emperor, to whom he intended to return power. <br/>
  o Fought to unify Japan against the Europeans, whom he saw as a threat to the fractured country. <br/>
