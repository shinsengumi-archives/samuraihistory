<div id="ygrps-yiv-1429991565">Hello,<br/>
Yi Amada , i have seen reference to him in several books and historical battles<br/>
However no History or solid facts <br/>
Was he Korean as the name suggests <br/>
or was he japanese ? <br/>
Did he change his name? Thanks in advance.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>I don't find that name ANYWHERE in the English speaking internet aside<br/>
from your questions about it. Name some of these "references... in<br/>
several books and historical battles".</div>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-288521868">Hello, Rychlo-san,<br/>
   <br/>
  I think this name sounds strange for Japanese people if the first name is Yi and the family name is Amada.<br/>
  Amada sounds like a Japanese family name, there are many Amada-san in Japan, so the family name has no problem.<br/>
  But the first name has a problem, I think.<br/>
  In my view, it must not be a Samurai's name, usually Samurai's names are composed of two Kanji, so pronunciation must be like Ma-sa-Mu-ne, Yo-shi-Mi-tsu, Mo-ri-U-ji, Ha-ru-No-bu....etc, in addition each name have four vowels in the first name (a,e,i,o,u).<br/>
  I think Yi is too short to be Samurai's first name...<br/>

 </span></blockquote>The most famous "Yi" in Japanese history is Yi Shunshin, the Korean  <br/>
Admiral who managed to cut the supply line between Japan and Korea  <br/>
during the invasions of the late 16th century, and de facto  <br/>
"defeated" the Japanese. I am wondering if "Amada" is a different (or  <br/>
wrong) reading of the characters that are usually read as "Shunshin."<br/>
Anyway, at this point I would be curious as well to know about the  <br/>
several books and battles you mentioned...<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1530095253">Yi  is Chinese/Korean family name<br/>
<br/>
Amada is Japanese family name<br/>
<br/>
Yi Amada sounds like fictional name which was made by someone who<br/>
don't know difference of Japanese name and Chinese/Korean name.<br/>
