 </span></blockquote>No, the use of a double by TAKEDA Shingen is groundless.  Totally fiction.<br/>
<br/>
A book named "Kou-you-gun-kan", which was written by KOUSAKA<br/>
Masanobu (Shingen's "boyfriend" and adviser) and his nephew KASUGA<br/>
Soujirou in some time from 1596 to 1624,  says that Shingen wanted to<br/>
suppress his heath for three years, but it dosen't mention about kagemusha<br/>
at all.  And Takeda clan seemed to fail to keep Shingen's will.  <br/>
Additionally<br/>
Kou-you-gun-kan has so many exaggerated stories that historians don't<br/>
regard it as reliable source so much.  ( I think there is no problem for <br/>
us to<br/>
believe only Shingen's will part though.)<br/>
<br/>
Moreover, a fact that Death of TAKEDA Shigenobu (Shingen's brother)<br/>
in Kawanakajima could be regarded as a death as Shingen's "kagemusha"<br/>
seems toreinforce the legend of Shingen's double.</div>
