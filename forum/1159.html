<div id="ygrps-yiv-1657524066">Here are some quick answers to your questions Dan. <br/>
<br/>
1. Can you give me some information on the orgin of the samurai?<br/>
A: They evolved out of military and house servants of the Heian <br/>
period.  The term samurai is the Japanese pronounciation of a sankrit <br/>
word that means "to serve".  There is a book entitled HIRED SWORDS: <br/>
THE RISE OF PRIVATE WARRIOR POWER IN EARLY JAPAN by Karl Friday.<br/>
  <br/>
2. What was the final outcome of the civil war between the Taira clan <br/>
and the Minamoto clan?<br/>
A:The Taira were eliminated.  Minamoto Yoritomo was declared Shogun, <br/>
and he ordered his brother Yoshitsune executed, but Yoshitsune took <br/>
his own life.  Yoshitsune is still considered one of the greates <br/>
warriors in Japanese history.<br/>
<br/>
3. What weapons and armour were preferred by the samurai?<br/>
A:Durring the time of warfare the spear was the most commonly used <br/>
weapon.  Both foot soldiers and samurai were armed with spears as <br/>
they were seen as the most practical.  Durring the time of peace <br/>
after the Tokugawa re-unification is when the sword became the main <br/>
weapon of the samurai, although it had always been a symbol of the <br/>
warrior, it was secondary until that time.<br/>
<br/>
4. How did the samurai view death?<br/>
A:  The samurai did not seek death in battle, but accepted the fact <br/>
that he might die.  <br/>
<br/>
5. What eventually led to the downfall of the samurai?<br/>
A:  In a simple way uselessness caused the fall of the samurai.  When <br/>
the emporer tried to regain power the samurai class had not been in a <br/>
major battle in about 200 years and couldnt put up a real fight <br/>
against the clans like Choshu and Satsuma that backed the Emporer.  <br/>
But the emporer did not want to risk the samurai becoming powerfull <br/>
again so the clas was abolished in 1868.<br/>
<br/>
Please someone correct me if I am wrong.  I hope these answers will <br/>
give you at least a starting point.</div>

Just as a preface, most people generally view the Samurai as a monolithic<br/>
class; this is quite incorrect.  Samurai as a class evolved through<br/>
Japanese history; Samurai are unusual in that a military group became the<br/>
upper class of Japanese society.  To the best of my knowledge, there is no<br/>
analog to this exists in the West.  <br/>
<br/>
Furthermore, at whatever point in time that you look at, the Samurai class<br/>
is also hierarchical; there is a stratification, just like you see in any<br/>
modern army.  <br/>
<br/>
Weapons and armor should be looked at in this fashion.  <br/>

 </span></blockquote>Excellent reference.  Prof. Friday is also a martial artist as well as a<br/>
prof. of Asian History.  His waza (techniques) are as good as his prose; I<br/>
have trained with him several times.  <br/>

<blockquote><span title="ireply"> >3. What weapons and armour were preferred by the samurai?<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>As in the preface, this depends on the time period and the hierarchical<br/>
position of the Samurai.  <br/>
<br/>
During the civil wars that predated the Tokugawa shogunate, the infantry<br/>
used Yari (spears) and Naginata (halberds, in this case, literally<br/>
saber-like blades on long poles), while the cavalry used Yumi (Japanese<br/>
long bows).  Mounted warriors also wore Tachi (a long saber slung across<br/>
the back with the blade down, which had to do with the drawing style while<br/>
mounted, "ground-to-sky") - mounted cavalry armed with sabers persisted in<br/>
the West into the 20th century.  <br/>
<br/>
Just a note here: a Japanese blade is a saber blade, which is single-edged<br/>
and curved, and not a sword, which is double-edged and straight.  The term<br/>
"samurai sword" referring to the Tachi or the Katana is technically a<br/>
misnomer.  <br/>
<br/>
The use of firearms by the warlord Oda Nobunaga in 1582 brought an end to<br/>
the mounted archers.  "Giving Up the Gun: Japan's Reversion to the Sword,<br/>
1543-1879" by Noel Perrin is an attempt to highlight this particular<br/>
phenomenon; unfortunately, Perrin's scholarship is shaky at best.  <br/>
<br/>
After, the foundation of the Tokugawa shogunate in 1603, the fighting army<br/>
units including the cavalry were disbanded.  The Tachi gave way to the<br/>
Katana, a saber of less curvature than the Tachi, worn thrust the Obi (wide<br/>
sash under the Hakama) with the blade up (which had to do with the drawing<br/>
style while standing, "sky-to-ground") .  The symbol of office of the<br/>
Samurai was the Daisho, a Daito (long saber) and Shoto (short saber) worn<br/>
on the left hip: there were no left-handed swordsmen, which persists to<br/>
this day in Kendo and Iaido, as well as classical styles of Kenjutsu.  In<br/>
general, the Daito was used outdoors (it was typically removed when<br/>
indoors), and the Shoto was used indoors.  No one else was permitted to<br/>
wear arms in public.  <br/>
<br/>
Sword lengths were eventually regulated by Shogunal edict as was dueling. <br/>
Even travel between the various fiefdoms was a burcratic nightmare as<br/>
travel was tightly regulated.  As the ruling c;ass, Samurai became the<br/>
bureaucrats for the Bakufu (tent government) in Edo (Tokyo), which was<br/>
established as a separate entity from the Imperial court in Kyoto, and<br/>
their own lords.  <br/>
<br/>
"Musashi," a historical novel by Eiji Yoshikawa (Charles S. Terry,<br/>
translator) captures some of the spirit of the transition between civil<br/>
war, Sengoku Jidai, and the emergence of the Tokugawa shogunate.   <br/>
<br/>
By the mid-1600's, most of the battle-hardened warriors had died, but the<br/>
training continued.  New techniques emerged, but most were never<br/>
battle-tested, and many ineffective ones were introduced.  Bujutsu (martial<br/>
science) gave way to budo (martial art), a way of building character<br/>
through a martial practice (in a sense, it did not matter if techniques<br/>
were battle-proved).  Some techniques, however, were proved effective in<br/>
dueling, which is not really the same as being proven in battle.  Early<br/>
forms of Kendo with body armor emerged as a way to safely train (in this<br/>
context, "safe" meant "non-fatal" rather than "injury-free").  <br/>
<br/>
[SNIP]<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> >5. What eventually led to the downfall of the samurai?<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Ultimately, the Samurai were superfluous.  During the Tokugawa Shogunate, a<br/>
middle class of merchants arose (commerce can thrive in a country at peace<br/>
with itself); the Bakufu restricted foreign trade to a single port,<br/>
Nagasaki, for all of Japan.  <br/>
<br/>
The appearance of the Black Ships lead by Commodore Perry in 1853 sent a<br/>
death shutter through the ruling organization as well as the class<br/>
structure of Japan.  The Bakufu had failed to protect Japan (and the<br/>
Emperor) from foreign "invasion."  The Tokugawa and related Han's<br/>
(fiefdoms) retreated into themselves and became concerned with<br/>
self-preservation; they slowly capitulated to the foreign demands as a<br/>
result, which was met with disgust in other Han's in Japan.  As the Bakufu<br/>
slowly lost its grip of control, several other Han's backed a policy of<br/>
supporting the Emperor directly and expelling the foreigners.  Civil unrest<br/>
grew.  Other foreign nations pressed demands on opening trade with Japan;<br/>
the Japanese feared that they would ultimately end up like China in that<br/>
era, becoming colonies of the western imperialistic nations.  Eventually,<br/>
Tokugawa Yoshinobu (1837-1913), the 15th and final Tokugawa shogunate,<br/>
restored power to the Emperor Meiji in 1868.  <br/>
<br/>
"Ryoma: Life of a Renaissance Samurai" by Romulus Hillsborough highlights<br/>
this turbulent period at the end of the existence of the Samurai as a<br/>
social class.  He is extremely important to Japanese history at this<br/>
critical juncture, and we are only just learning about it.  For example,<br/>
just imagine ignoring Ben Franklin's role in the founding of the United<br/>
States of Ameria.  <br/>
<br/>
The Emperor brought Japan out of its feudal era and into the industrial<br/>
era.  As such, Japan had no Renaissance period, no Reformation, and no<br/>
Industrial Revolution as in the West.  IMHO, this is the key to<br/>
understanding modern Japan.  Imagine the Age of Chivalry in Europe giving<br/>
way to the Franco-Prussian War.  Furthermore, Japan distinguished itself as<br/>
a world-class fighting power in wars with China in 1894 and Russia in 1905,<br/>
which is a huge leap from their state of conducting warfare in 1868.  Japan<br/>
embraced many of the ideas and all of the technology of the Western<br/>
nations.  Japanese people were sent abroad to study in the West in order to<br/>
bring back anything useful.  <br/>
<br/>
The highly rigid class structure that was set up during the Tokugawa<br/>
shogunate was abolished and with it the Samurai as a class.  Wearing the<br/>
Daisho in public was outlawed.  The Cho-mage, the topknot of hair that was<br/>
also a distinctive characteristic of the Samurai, was also outlawed (it<br/>
still exists, however, in the upper ranks of professional Sumo wrestlers). <br/>
In the final analysis, the Samurai, though inter-Han struggles,<br/>
self-destructed with respect to the new social order that emerged as a<br/>
result.  <br/>
<br/>
Most of the ex-Samurai did not fare well after the Meiji Restoration. <br/>
Those who became merchants were mostly failures (as Samurai, money was not<br/>
a concern as it was beneath them to worry about such "trivial" matters). <br/>
<br/>
Some went into law enforcement, and some went into government service,<br/>
enjoying varying degrees of success.  A few opened Dojo (practice halls)<br/>
and taught martial arts like Japanese swordsmanship and Jujutsu to the<br/>
public (which was a novelty as only Samurai were allowed to train with<br/>
weapons).  <br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> >Please someone correct me if I am wrong.  I hope these answers will <br/>
>give you at least a starting point.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>The Samurai, although they no longer exist as a class, had a profound<br/>
effect in shaping Japan as a nation and the Japanese as a people.  I have<br/>
personally met Japanese people who will add in an introduction of<br/>
themselves and others that they are from a Samurai family or that some<br/>
blood relative (e.g., grandfather or great grandfather) was a Samurai. <br/>
This would be like meeting a European today who would say that their<br/>
grandfather or great grandfather had been a knight at the court in Camelot,<br/>
for example.  <br/>
<br/>
Most of us have held some very romantic notions of Samurai and their lives<br/>
and so-called ideals.  It is entirely undeserved.  "Shogun" by James<br/>
Clavell is a nice story but one seen through very thick rose-colored<br/>
glasses (both the book [1976] and the mini-series [1980] are important<br/>
landmarks in their respective media) -- they are unbalanced.  <br/>
<br/>
Here are two counterbalancing books: <br/>
<br/>
"Memoirs of the Warrior Kumagai: A Historical Novel" by Donald Richie<br/>
(1999).  Don't let the term Novel in the title through you; this is a good<br/>
rendition of life and times during the civil war between the Minamoto and<br/>
Taira.  This is the real story behind what becomes the well-loved, medieval<br/>
epic , the "Tale of the Heike" (Heike is another pronunciation for Taira,<br/>
who were the *losers* in this struggle).  This is analagous to Michael<br/>
Chriton's novel "Eaters of the Dead" (and the movie, "The 13th Warrior,"<br/>
which is a pale adaptation IMHO) or  John Champlin Gardner's novel<br/>
"Grendel" being (hypothetically) plausible stories behind the Old English<br/>
epic poem "Beowulf" (I have a fondness for the Seamus Heaney translation,<br/>
which is rendered in verse, rather than prose, as it is in the original<br/>
language)<br/>
<br/>
"Drunk as a Lord: Samurai Stories" by Ryotaro Shiba (Eileen Kato,<br/>
translator) (2001), as historical fiction, focuses on four historical<br/>
figures during the late Edo period after the appearance of the Black Ships.<br/>
 Although the characters' personalities are somewhat fictionalized, the<br/>
point of this book as I see it is that the Samurai were all too human, and<br/>
they, embedded in their culture and historical events, were not really any<br/>
different in their behavior than us, embedded within our culture and<br/>
historical events.  <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1071158815">Answer to Question.2.<br/>
The War of 1180-85 ended with the annihilation of the<br/>
Taira and their infant Emperor, the infant Antoku . As<br/>
a result Minamoto no Yoritomo became the predominant<br/>
warlord, removing the potential threat of his brother<br/>
Yoshitsune and establishing himself, ably handling<br/>
relations between himself, the religious sects, and<br/>
the imperial Court . As a result, he established the<br/>
Kamakura bakufu (shogunate) in 1192 .<br/>
Hope this helps<br/>
