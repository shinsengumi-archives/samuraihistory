<h3>samurai class</h3>
by <i>twheels2many</i>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1010978681">It is theoretically possible, though, that the class could be restored, either through a legal <br/>
decision, or through a collective revolt by samurai descendents. I'm trying to think of an <br/>
historical illustration of this... Can't. Does anyone else know of a restoration of a class through <br/>
revolt or law? In The Three Musketeers, this happens with the Musketeers. But that's fiction, <br/>
and the Musketeers weren't a "class" (though there might be some parallels). Lookin' for a real <br/>
historical example...<br/>
<br/>
Here's a different idea...<br/>
In India, the law has abolished the caste system. However, in real everyday life, the caste <br/>
system is just as real as it was before the laws. The law only serves its purpose if people obey <br/>
it, or if it is enforced. So it is theoretically possible, also, that descendents of samurai could <br/>
claim to be samurai, and if accepted by the general public, they would for all intents and <br/>
purposes BE samurai, though legally the class has been abolished. Of course, what a samurai <br/>
today would do or be is ... well... difficult to imagine. Maybe they would carry two guns instead <br/>
of two swords, LOL, and collectively comprise the Japanese police force.<br/>
<br/>
Theoretically, suppose that history had happened this way: Upon the abolishment of the <br/>
samurai class, the samurai still lived as samurai, and the public still regarded them as <br/>
samurai. The government still gave them their stipend, too. (Governments often act in an <br/>
inconsistent manner like this.) Now, if history had happened this way, would that group of <br/>
people still be samurai, even though legally the class was abolished?<br/>
<br/>
I think they would. <br/>
<br/>
This has some parallel to the idea of common-law marriages. If a man and woman "shack up" <br/>
for an extended period of time, and live as man and wife, even though they have never <br/>
exchanged vows or rings... they are for all intents and purposes man and wife. That was <br/>
common practice or "common-law"... the government eventually recognized this and would <br/>
after said elapse of time pronounce them legally man and wife (so the government could get <br/>
additional taxes out of them).<br/>
<br/>
Anyway, the man and wife were really man and wife BEFORE the government acknowledged <br/>
them to be so. It isn't a piece of paper that makes one man and wife. It's the lifestyle. Many <br/>
cultures don't have "pieces of paper" from the government to confirm or legitimize the marriage. <br/>
Public practice or public acceptance takes presidence over legal action. <br/>
<br/>
So what if someone today claimed to be a samurai? If general public acceptance, apart from <br/>
law, would in all practicality make one a samurai (like commonlaw marriage or the Indian caste <br/>
system), how much of the public would it take to justify that claim? What's the critical mass <br/>
required for acceptance? Certainly not 100 percent, because even in the samurai's heyday, <br/>
there were people who didn't agree with the class system as it was. Maybe 51%? A simple <br/>
majority? Who decides what the percentage would be?<br/>
<br/>
All this to say, "NO!" Samurai DON'T exist today... but theoretically, it's possible.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>I also thought of that example but what happened in Spain wasn't exactly <br/>
the restoration of a Monarchy but instead of a Constitutional Monarchy <br/>
(I think this is the term). This means that although the King is the <br/>
chief of state and there are noble titles there is no social class <br/>
system and the country is ruled by a government (much like in many other <br/>
Constitutional Monarchies throughout Europe).<br/>
<br/>
And although there are noble titles that doesn't also mean that there is <br/>
a Noble class. For example, here in Portugal we have a Republic and <br/>
obviously there is no noble class or anything like that. However, there <br/>
are still people that use their noble titles. So, as in th Indian cast <br/>
example, the fact that there is no social class doesn't prevent people <br/>
from acting as if there was one.</div>

 </span></blockquote>But as previously stated, anyone who made the claim<br/>
would be looked at as if they had a certain appendage<br/>
protruding from their forehead instead of their fly.<br/>
You make a wonderful semantical argument that has no<br/>
basis in reality.<br/>
<br/>

but I doubt it will happen anytime soon. (I did go to<br/>
King of Prussia Mall near Philly, though, about a<br/>
month ago.)<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1098958315">Thank you for the considered answer. I appreciate that the re-establishment of the samurai as a functioning class is next to impossible, but it was just a thought to try and stimulate a debate, if a little semantic.<br/>
However, upon your point about the restoration of a class, an example springs to mind, the restoration of the aristocracy along with Louis XVIII, in France after the allied monarchies had removed the Bonapartists from government in 1814. Not a good role model  though as they returned even more pompous and existed only until the Revolution in 1830.<br/>

Theoretically, you can speculate, but it makes no sense at all.<br/>
<br/>
Modern Japan is a democracy, and classes have nothing to do with it. <br/>
There is no way the government is going to pay a salary to samurai <br/>
descendants, no way people could go around the country carrying <br/>
weapons, and once again I remind you that to be a samurai means to <br/>
***SERVE*** a lord.<br/>
So, who will they serve? Shogun Koizumi?<br/>
<br/>
Moreover, the comparison with India does not hold up. India is a 75% <br/>
rural country, a pseudo-democracy, and a country where the great <br/>
majority of people are Hindu: classes are defined by religion.<br/>
<br/>
Thus, unlike in Japan, Indian society is still structured on a vertical <br/>
axis, especially at the village level. Japan has vertical relationships <br/>
in schools, companies, etc. but NOT in its constitution. The vertical <br/>
relationships in Japan are of a microcosmic nature, and do not permeate <br/>
society as a whole.<br/>
<br/>
Finally, Hindu homogeneity is generally not yet mollified by Western <br/>
influences and got rid of  Buddhism.<br/>
<br/>
These are the reasons why Hindu ideology can still continue. (And of <br/>
course -as usual- there are economic reasons as well.)<br/>
<br/>
And talking about economy, being the second wealthiest country in the <br/>
world, having schools, hospitals, Panasonics and Toyotas, do you think <br/>
the Japanese would care a bit about restoring a medieval social class?<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-816255459">Hi.<br/>
Confining the subject to purely academic sides, I do<br/>
find all your arguments on 'this Samurai death<br/>
certificate' quite entertaining. <br/>
<br/>
We started to observe that we have political<br/>
scientists and lawyers on this listserv who impose<br/>
their tools of analysis on this trivial topic and yet<br/>
regenerate it into something interesting.  Of course,<br/>
this is true only when we secure a certain level of<br/>
leniency from serious historians and Japanese studies<br/>
scholars on their standard of rigor on the historical<br/>
research as a science.<br/>
<br/>
I think that this new trend would benefit all of us as<br/>
long as we do not bog ourselves with frivolous mocking<br/>
and offenses.(personal, racial, and cultural) <br/>
As someone told probabily about two month ago, I came<br/>
to this group to 'LEARN' from experts. In that sense,<br/>
don't you think that it would be a good idea not to<br/>
bring up this 'death' subject for the time being for<br/>
all of us?<br/>
<br/>
ps. I liked an argument using the concept of English<br/>
common law(whoever wrote this) and Cesare's<br/>
counter-argument. <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
        <br/>
                            Sincerely,<br/>

<h3>Re: [samuraihistory] samurai class</h3>
by <i>mijalo_jp</i>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-361941118">"Guys; Give up"?? I fully appreciate that the issue of the re-institution of the samurai, or their continued functioning presence within modern Japanese society is impossible, even irrational, and the argument is based upon using a great deal of "what ifs", but is that a reason for those who have contributed to be told to "give up"?? <br/>
I have enjoyed this forum for over 2 years now, both for the history and culture I have learned, aswell as the pushing-and-pulling between various peoples opinions. There has also been a whole series debates on whether certain authors' books are just rehashes, organizing trips to Kyoto, want-to-be samurai, and sometimes even just plain old simple abuse.  Most has been enjoyable, some not so. Not everyone can be interested in the same topics or conversations (however hypothetical), so I don't feel certain members should simply try to put a block on what other another member, or members, wish to talk about.<br/>

<h3>One minor point</h3>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1900190994">Dear Group:<br/>
I often have read discussions involving Buddihism as a<br/>
part of the Japanese culture.<br/>
With regard to the connection of the Japanese Buddhism<br/>
to that of India, South Asia, and Tibet, I want to<br/>
point out that they are significantly different.<br/>
<br/>
The Japanese Buddism results from intellectual<br/>
interaction among Taoism, Confucianism and Buddhism<br/>
itself throughout centuries, the first two of which<br/>
did not really have much effect on India, South Asia,<br/>
and Tibet.<br/>
Through this interaction, primitive Taoism and<br/>
Confucianism was reborn as more subtle and complex<br/>
philosophy with rigorous logical structures in 5 and<br/>
12 centuries respectivly.As for the proper terminology<br/>
for the present Taoism and Confuncianism for the<br/>
Westerners, I personally think that words like<br/>
'Theoretical' Taoism and Confuciansim would suit.<br/>
<br/>
This is one of reasons why I think that we need to<br/>
consider having a distinctly different cultural<br/>

Where is your sources?<br/>

<br/>
With the exception of the Nichiren Shoshu (Not Nichiren Shu), that I will<br/>
give no comments for politeness reasons...<br/>
<br/>
Your information is incorrect, specially if ye take in an absolute degree.<br/>
<br/>
Yes, taoism had an influence in japanese culture, but buddhism is another<br/>
case.<br/>
<br/>
We can say at certain points that in popular sence, due to the Shinbutsu<br/>
Shugo historical phenomena, there was some syncretisms between buddhism and<br/>
shindo (way of the gods, the indigenous faith of japan, also know as<br/>
shintoism) like the Shichifukujin, in special the Daikokuten, that is a<br/>
translation of the sanskrit Mahâkala, a wrathful war deity, called to fight<br/>
evil spirits, grant victory against evil enemies, and to ensure prosperity<br/>
with an image of an shinto god of weathiness whose name is something like<br/>
"...onushin no kami" or something like that.<br/>
<br/>
If you read the Shingon-shu founder Kubo Daishi Kûkai Great Treatise about<br/>
the three religions, including Buddhism, Taoism and Confucionism, you would<br/>
see his great knowledge about these three philosofical systems, but showing<br/>
Buddhism as supperior, so discouraging mixes and saladas.<br/>
<br/>
He went to China, to receive the transmission of the Tantric Vajrayana<br/>
Buddhism from Hui-kwo, who received from Subhakarasimha, who have a direct<br/>
lineage to Nagarjuna himself.<br/>
<br/>
The same happens with the Zen (chinese: Chaan Sanskrit: Dhyana) Shu<br/>
buddhism. They have a direct linneage of tranmission direct from<br/>
Boddhidharma who also transmitted the Bodhisattva Vajramukti that is the<br/>
root of the majority of several asiatic martial systems, including Karate<br/>
whose movements are based on the paterns of the Maha-Mandala that is the<br/>
embodyment of the three holy bodies of Dai-nichi Nyorai (Maha Vairocana<br/>
Tathagâta) and Shaka Nyorai (Shakyamuni Tathagâta).<br/>
<br/>
study more before saying ignorant things about Japan.<br/>
<br/>
I was a Mikkyo follower, including Shugendo, for several years in my past,<br/>
and even if no longer a buddhist, I still respect this way due to their<br/>
tolerance towards others religions, unlike certain ones that promoted a real<br/>
bloodshed in Europe, Japan, Brazil, etc...<br/>

<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-2090592382">If you want to argue with me, you have to provide a<br/>
source and refute it directly sentence by sentence.<br/>
Obviously, your writing exhibits your knowledge about<br/>
the Japanese Buddhism. But, as for your response, I do<br/>
not know where to start to touch if I am a surgeon to<br/>
operate on the patient.<br/>
<br/>
To make things clearer, the framework I placed in the<br/>
distinction and the interaction among Taoism,<br/>
Confucianism, and Buddihism has been quite<br/>
conventional and been well known facts among scholars<br/>
in the continent. <br/>
It is just not known to the Western scholars because<br/>
most of sources were written for people who are<br/>
familiar with the Chinese literature. Let's consider<br/>
your case:<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> > Where is your sources?<br/>
> Had ye at LEAST studyed anything about japanese<br/>
> buddhism?<br/>
 </span></blockquote>What is the meaning of the 'Japanese' Buddhism? Can we<br/>
talk about the Japanese Buddhism without linking to<br/>
China or India? <br/>
Yes, we can, but depending on the specificis of<br/>
analysis on the given topics, we leave out China or<br/>
India. So, given the scopes of studies, we can<br/>
formulate the wide, intermediate, and the short ranged<br/>
analytical scopes. <br/>
If we say that the studies of the Japanese Buddhism<br/>
including India and China are the wide-ranged studies,<br/>
we may say that studies leaving out India, but<br/>
including China are the intermediate ranged studies. <br/>
My argument becomes clearer if you superimpose this<br/>
intermediate scope on your mind, which probabiliy<br/>
requires the understanding of the 'theoretical' Taoism<br/>
and Confucianism in addition to the 'Japanese'<br/>
Buddhism.(Mere understaning or reading of primitive<br/>
Taosim and Confucianism books would not help as I<br/>
pointed out before)<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> > Yes, taoism had an influence in japanese culture,<br/>
> but buddhism is another<br/>
> case.<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Can we discuss the Japanese culture without Buddhism?<br/>
Yes, we can. But, as I said, it depends on your scope<br/>
of analysis.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> > Your information is incorrect, specially if ye take<br/>
> in an absolute degree.<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I never draw my argument in an absolute degree.<br/>
However, I was absolute in my scope of observation.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> > We can say at certain points that in popular sence,<br/>
> due to the Shinbutsu<br/>

 </span></blockquote>True. But in the sense of short-ranged(not meant for<br/>
any negative sense) studies on 'Pure'(if any) Japanese<br/>
Buddihism. (I do not need to reiterate that it is the<br/>
relative judgement)<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> > If you read the Shingon-shu founder Kubo Daishi<br/>
> K�kai Great Treatise about<br/>
> the three religions, including Buddhism, Taoism and<br/>

> Buddhism as supperior, so discouraging mixes and<br/>
> saladas<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Even on the continent(China and Korea), there were<br/>
'mixes and saladas'. But, it simply looked like it<br/>
when we did not make a rigid distinction between<br/>
Buddhism and 'Folk' Buddhism. Recall that many of<br/>
common people in the North Asis were illiterate<br/>
whereas the nobility class exhibited intelligence of<br/>
high complexity and rigor until the modernization<br/>
period.<br/>
<br/>
Lastly, what is the meaning of these?<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> > Are you nuts Mr Lee?<br/>
> study more before saying ignorant things about<br/>
> Japan.<br/>
 </span></blockquote>My current research area is on quantum mechanics and<br/>
it application to social sciences. I have been working<br/>
lately until last Friday night and opened your message<br/>
now.<br/>
Do you think that I should be 'nice' with you?<br/>
<br/>
I remind you that I once told that if you had any<br/>
personal stuff with me, you'd better email me<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1331918388">First a question: Has anyone read "Zen and the Way of the Sword: Arming the Samurai <br/>
Psyche" by Winston King? This group is pretty big on "no bushido before musashi" and I think <br/>
(from the reviews I've read) King assumes bushido was always a part of the Samurai lifestyle. <br/>
<br/>
I haven't read much on the use of Zen in the Samurai class. Zen seems to be strangely <br/>
compatible in an opposites attract sort of way with Bushido, but what about before Bushido <br/>
was really around? Which, did Zen give birth to Bushido in some way? And what role did Zen <br/>
really play in the samurai's life? I just don't see the connection or compatibility between the <br/>
upper warrior class and Zen Buddhism. The principles and lifestyle just don't seem to mesh.<br/>
<br/>
Anyway, In defense of Mr. Lee,<br/>
<br/>
What he may have been getting at was the difference between Mahayana and Theravada <br/>
Buddhism. Mahayana is the more popular, less rigorous, and more syncretistic variety found <br/>
throughout SE Asia, whereas Theravada is the more "pure" version of Buddhism, which had a <br/>
stronger hold in Japan (Zen Buddhism being a subcategory of Theravada). Zen, as a <br/>
subcategory of Theravada, adds to the mix the idea of "immediate" enlightenment rather than <br/>
gradual enlightenment, through the use of meditation to bring about enlightening moments, or <br/>
epiphanies.<br/>
<br/>
But where Lee says that Korean, Japanese, and Chinese Buddhism should all be in one <br/>
category, he's right as far as them all being Theravada, but he's wrong in that Japanese <br/>
Buddhism is pretty different from Chinese, at least in that Chinese Buddhism is more <br/>
syncretistic. Japanese Buddhism is generally regarded as being the version closest to the <br/>
original Buddhism.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>I wouldn't say that Japanese Buddhism "results from" that interaction, but rather that the <br/>
presence of Taoism and Confucianism allowed for Buddhism to be accepted with greater ease. <br/>
Taoism and Confucianism are primarily atheistic, as is Theravada Buddhism. Both promote a <br/>
general morality, as does Buddhism. And Taoism, with its quizzical proverbs and mysterious <br/>
statements, parallels (a little bit) the practices of Zen teachers quizzing their students (strange <br/>
statements that don't really mean anything but might help you understand something else). <br/>
And Buddhism can easily be looked at as "The Way". But "parallels" is a different thing than <br/>
"results from." I think history would show that Japanese Buddhism - rather than being an <br/>
example of syncretism - is actually the closest to the original Buddhism of India. Mahayana <br/>
Buddhism is sometimes VERY syncretistic, and has little to do with what Siddartha Gautama <br/>
actually taught, and again, the Buddhism of Japan is different from that of China, even though <br/>
they're both technically Theravada.<br/>
<br/>
For those who don't know the history: Buddhism started in India as kind of a reactionary <br/>
spinoff of Hinduism. It grew in popularity and Buddhist missionaries were sent out to Asia. As <br/>
Theravada Buddhism spread in Asia (and through China, into Japan) there was a resurgence of <br/>
Hinduism in India, and the Hindus killed or drove out all the Buddhists. In Japan, the Buddhism <br/>
stayed more or less in its pure form, but in the rest of Asia, it developed into a less rigorous <br/>
version (Mahayana) and mixed with the traditional religions. Though China is technically <br/>
theravada, it's still syncretistic, so more like the rest of asia than Japan.<br/>

First a question: Has anyone read "Zen and the Way of the Sword: Arming the<br/>

musashi" and I think<br/>
(from the reviews I've read) King assumes bushido was always a part of the<br/>
Samurai lifestyle.<br/>
------------------<br/>
OCT: Nope, I didn't read the book, but I think this statement is aceptable.<br/>
According to what I've studied, there was before Musashi, a type of non<br/>
written Samurai's Morality System.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
I haven't read much on the use of Zen in the Samurai class. Zen seems to be<br/>

don't seem to mesh.<br/>
-------------------------<br/>
OCT: Don't know if it will help ya get the answer, but those symbols at the<br/>
Kessa (Sanskrit: Kassaya) of Soto Zen Shu is actually Crest of Arms of two<br/>
Samurai Families that I don't recall their names. However I believe any<br/>
Zenji Bishop (Sozu) can answer this to ya.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Anyway, In defense of Mr. Lee,<br/>
--------------<br/>
OCT: In defense? If I understand well, ye pointed a third way of thinking,<br/>
that I should agree in some points.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
What he may have been getting at was the difference between Mahayana and<br/>
Theravada<br/>
Buddhism. Mahayana is the more popular, less rigorous, and more syncretistic<br/>
variety found<br/>
throughout SE Asia, whereas Theravada is the more "pure" version of<br/>
Buddhism, which had a<br/>
stronger hold in Japan (Zen Buddhism being a subcategory of Theravada). Zen,<br/>
as a<br/>
subcategory of Theravada, adds to the mix the idea of "immediate"<br/>
enlightenment rather than<br/>
gradual enlightenment, through the use of meditation to bring about<br/>
enlightening moments, or<br/>
epiphanies.<br/>
---------------------------<br/>
OCT: I think ye are not 100% accurate. Dhyana is not a theravada school,<br/>
however there is comments between the Dhyana (Zen, Chaan) school and<br/>
Theravadins that Dhyana is the most Theravada of the Mahayana Schools, and<br/>
ya must know that Vajrayana is a subdivision of the Mahayana as well, since<br/>
it both includes Mahayana Sutras and Treatises, the Classical (theravada)<br/>
Canon that is the Tripitaka (Three Vases) and their own vajrayana treatises,<br/>
sutras, shastras and saddhanas.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
But where Lee says that Korean, Japanese, and Chinese Buddhism should all be<br/>
in one<br/>
category, he's right as far as them all being Theravada, but he's wrong in<br/>
that Japanese<br/>
Buddhism is pretty different from Chinese, at least in that Chinese Buddhism<br/>
is more<br/>
syncretistic. Japanese Buddhism is generally regarded as being the version<br/>
closest to the<br/>
original Buddhism.<br/>
---------------------<br/>
OCT: It depends to what school you refer. The Hokkekyo is totally Japanese<br/>
and much of its contends have a great range of diferences between it and<br/>
Original Buddhism in itself. Hokekkyo and Pure Land Teachings was the most<br/>
popular between the peasants and would be that what Mr. Lee called Japan's<br/>
Folk-Buddhism, However Zen Shu (all both two schools of Japan - Soto and<br/>
Hinzai if not mispelled the last one) and Vajrayana Schools (Shingon-Shu and<br/>
Tendai-Shu) was the popular ones between the dominant class like the<br/>
Samurais and those of the Imperial Court.<br/>
***<br/>
All of couse, worshipped Shinto Gods (specially the Imperial Family, Te<br/>
hee).<br/>

statements that don't really mean anything but might help you understand<br/>
something else).<br/>
-------------<br/>
OCT: Your thoughs have logic, but sorry. According to what I remember,<br/>
Buddhism does not entered due to the acceptance of Taoism and Confucianism<br/>
in Japan. But in an independent way. I unfortunatelly does not have anymore<br/>
the book of japanese history that taunt this to me, so I can't give ya the<br/>
accurate date and century, but a certain japanese emperor married a chinese<br/>
noble lady, and when she comes to Japan, she brough an image of Amithaba<br/>
Buddha, and some sutras. The image was destroyed by shinto peasants, who was<br/>
afraid that "this new religion would be forced down by the emperor's wife<br/>
and force them to forget their holy Gods" but in the end, buddhism never<br/>
entered in conflict with the native religion, but instead, it helped in the<br/>
preservation of shinto, since Japan was illiterate at that time, and all<br/>
Shinto Rites, myths and history was based on Oral Tradition. With the advent<br/>
of buddhism, and latter, the Kukai (Shingon-shu founder) interference, there<br/>
comes the hiragana and katakana, and the common folk was also learn how to<br/>
write and read. So, there comes from it, a form of shinto written liturgy.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
And Buddhism can easily be looked at as "The Way". But "parallels" is a<br/>
different thing than<br/>
"results from." I think history would show that Japanese Buddhism - rather<br/>
than being an<br/>
example of syncretism - is actually the closest to the original Buddhism of<br/>
India. Mahayana<br/>
Buddhism is sometimes VERY syncretistic, and has little to do with what<br/>
Siddartha Gautama<br/>
actually taught, and again, the Buddhism of Japan is different from that of<br/>
China, even though<br/>
they're both technically Theravada.<br/>
------------------<br/>
OCT: Don't forget that even Shingon-shu and Tendai-shu comes from China,<br/>
although the tantric buddhism that was transmited to Kukai, was extinct.<br/>
Perhaps buddhism comes intact to China, and there remained so, until a very<br/>
latter influence that changed their ways. The reason why I disagree with<br/>
your statement about they be both theravada, I already explained. Also<br/>
remember that the most important Sutra of Zen Shu is Hannya Shingyo - Heart<br/>
Sutra (Prajña Pâramita Hrdaya Sutra)<br/>
<br/>
For those who don't know the history: Buddhism started in India as kind of a<br/>
reactionary<br/>
spinoff of Hinduism. It grew in popularity and Buddhist missionaries were<br/>
sent out to Asia. As<br/>
Theravada Buddhism spread in Asia (and through China, into Japan) there was<br/>
a resurgence of<br/>
Hinduism in India, and the Hindus killed or drove out all the Buddhists. In<br/>
Japan, the Buddhism<br/>
stayed more or less in its pure form, but in the rest of Asia, it developed<br/>
into a less rigorous<br/>
version (Mahayana) and mixed with the traditional religions. Though China is<br/>
technically<br/>
theravada, it's still syncretistic, so more like the rest of asia than<br/>
Japan.<br/>
------------------------------------<br/>
OCT: The ressurgence of hinduism in India was totally pacific. Although it<br/>
was an threat to Buddhism in India, it was non violent and buddhism was<br/>
destroyed there through extreme syncretism, with hinduism assimilating some<br/>
of the buddhist vallues and Siddharta Gautama (Shakyamuni Buddha) as one of<br/>
those avatars that are manifestations of Vishnu. The real violent threat to<br/>
buddhism in India was two centuries latter, with the muslim invasion.<br/>
<br/>
The sincretism in the Japanese case, is called as Shinbutsu Shugo, and is<br/>
fully studied at Sophia University at Japan.<br/>
<br/>
And yes, buddhism, taoism and confucionism (as well, poetry, caligraphy,<br/>
etc) was subject of study in universities at Edo Jidai, and all of them<br/>
could be possible, be the seeds to form the non written Samurai morality,<br/>
even before Musashi, since those who went to those universities was the<br/>
noble aristocratic classes and those samurais.<br/>
<br/>
I remember that when I was following Shugendo or Vajrayana, my former<br/>
masters would be very angry if I would be doing any kind of Salada, so just<br/>
remembering their angry faces was enough to be horrorified with what  Mr.<br/>
Lee stated. And it had nothing to do with intolerance. One of them have an<br/>
