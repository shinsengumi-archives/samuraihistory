<br/>
-When the shoguns were in power the Emperors were still around. The Japanese Imperial family is the longest unbroken line of rulers in history.<br/>
-Training and weapons......complex subject depends on the region, time period individual preference etc you could write a book on the one subject alone.<br/>
-Diamyo........ Yes they were the lords of the samurai, but they WERE samurai, like a modern day general, who leads soldiers but is also a soldier himself and commands and fights along side of them. Also he was the head of the clan and ruler of a region, a province or several provinces, that may or may not be fully autonomous and therefore had authority over EVERYTHING that went on in his lands.<br/>
<br/>
Hope this helps it is a very complex subject and this is only the short answer.<br/>

<br/>
<br/>
  hello,<br/>
  for a project on school I am making a survey about the samurai. I have some questions:<br/>
  - whenn the shoguns ruled japan there was no emperor, was there?<br/>
  - can someone tell me something about the training of the samurai? or information about the wapens they used and how?<br/>
  - who exactly were the daimyo? As far I understand they were the lords of the samurai, but did the daymio fight also?<br/>
  - I would like to know something about the influence of confucius on the life of the samurai.<br/>
  thanks in advance.<br/>
<br/>
  regards,<br/>
  shannon<br/>
