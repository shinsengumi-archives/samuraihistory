SAMURAI HISTORY TOUR with Author of ³RYOMA²<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
The overthrow of the shogun in 1868 was one of the great events in <br/>
Asian history. As The Wall Street Journal reports, Sakamoto Ryoma, a <br/>
leader of the revolution, is the idol of the financial and <br/>
governmental elite in today¹s Japan. Ryoma and his samurai <br/>
contemporaries, and the historic cities where the revolution <br/>
unfolded, are the focus of SAMURAI HISTORY TOUR.<br/>
<br/>
Romulus Hillsborough, acclaimed author of RYOMA ­ Life of a <br/>
Renaissance Samurai, has recently created the tour. ³We will visit <br/>
old houses and inns, feudal castles, Buddhist temples, sites of <br/>
battles and assassinations, villas of feudal lords, museums, statues <br/>
and gravesites,² says Hillsborough. ³We will view the actual swords <br/>
these samurai used, the clothes they wore, and personal possessions <br/>
they kept with them during those turbulent and bloody years. I will <br/>
narrate the tour in order to share the knowledge I have gained <br/>
throughout my travels and research over these past twenty years. By <br/>
so doing, I hope to bring this fascinating era to life before your <br/>
very eyes.²<br/>
<br/>
The tour groups will be small so that the author may share his <br/>
knowledge and answer questions on a personalized basis. He will also <br/>
speak about the history of the destinations on each evening before <br/>
the visits. The tours will be operated by Japan Travel Bureau Group <br/>
(JTB), the world¹s largest travel company. The first tour is <br/>
scheduled September 15 - 24, 2003.<br/>
<br/>
The price of Samurai History Tour, including roundtrip airfare, most <br/>
meals and 8 nights at deluxe or superior hotels and Japanese inns, is <br/>
$3,950 per person. For more information contact the San Francisco <br/>
Office of JTB at 360 Post Street, Suite 305, San Francisco, CA 94108, <br/>
