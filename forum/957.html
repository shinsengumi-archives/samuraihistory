    I have just joined this list and wished to express my greetings to all<br/>
of you. I am very interested in Japanese history and have visited Japan<br/>
twice. I know a little history, but I want to learn more, much much more. I<br/>
am hoping that being a member of this list will broaden my knowledge. I have<br/>
visited the Samurai Archives web page very frequently in the past and have<br/>
just stumbled onto this e-mail group. I hope to meet new people with whom I<br/>
can talk about Japan and it's history.<br/>
<br/>
Compassion go with you,<br/>
<br/>
