<h3>Gohatto</h3>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1883925507">Greetings all - <br/>
<br/>
I saw Gohatto last night, the Oshima movie, I think it's been around for a while, but the kind of film that will only <br/>
play in arthouse theatres, and as far as I know, on first release in the UK.<br/>
<br/>
The action takes place within the Shinsengumi (set in 1865) - the storyline concerns homosexual passions - a <br/>
beautiful young swordsman joins the ranks causing 'ripples' - but the fencing scenes, both within the dojo and <br/>
in the street, are some of, if not the best, I've ever seen. <br/>
<br/>
I cannot recommend this film highly enough. It will definitely join my library where I shall wear out the tape <br/>
replaying the dojo fencing sessions again and again.<br/>
