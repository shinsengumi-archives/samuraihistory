The first popular survey of Japan's samurai film genre and its <br/>

<br/>
STRAY DOGS & LONE WOLVES: THE SAMURAI FILM HANDBOOK<br/>
by Patrick Galloway<br/>
<br/>
June 2005 (Berkeley, CA) ­ Stone Bridge Press, publisher of books <br/>
about Japan, introduces its third major book on cinema, this time <br/>
celebrating one of the most beloved genres from Japan: the samurai <br/>
film!<br/>
<br/>
"Stray Dogs & Lone Wolves" is a critical guide to over 50 top <br/>
samurai films, including such masterworks as the Oscar-winning 'Gate <br/>
of Hell,' 'Yojimbo' (remade five times, including 'A Fistful of <br/>
Dollars'), the influential 'Lady Snowblood,' and newly released hits <br/>
like Takeshi Kitano's 'Zatoichi.'<br/>
<br/>
"Packed with great reviews and tons of background details, 'Stray <br/>
Dogs and Lone Wolves' is a must for fans­or would-be fans­of the <br/>
samurai genre," said Robert Woodhead, CEO of AnimEigo. "I've already <br/>
used it to make note of several films that we ought to release here <br/>
in the U.S."<br/>
<br/>
Also here is information on the samurai era in Japan, the Japanese <br/>
film industry, and the key actors and directors such as Akira <br/>
Kurosawa, Toshiro Mifune, and Tatsuya Nakadai who turned these <br/>
warrior tales of loyalty, duty, revenge, and explosive swordsmanship <br/>
into a great dramatic art that has captivated the world.<br/>
<br/>
Author Patrick Galloway is a lifelong student of Asian philosophy, <br/>
film, and culture. Tired of how his favorite film genre is <br/>
mistreated by most academic film critics, he took matters into his <br/>
own hands and wrote the book for which he and his fellow samurai <br/>
movie fans have been waiting.<br/>
<br/>
"It is rare even among the Japanese to find anyone so well informed <br/>
and passionate about Japan's unique genre of samurai films," said <br/>
legendary actor Tatsuya Nakadai. "I admire Patrick Galloway's great <br/>
enthusiasm, and I hope his book will help you enjoy these films too."<br/>
<br/>
Stray Dogs & Lone Wolves: The Samurai Film Handbook is 240 pages, <br/>
paperback, with 40 black & white photos. It retails for US$19.95. <br/>
