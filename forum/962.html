<br/>
I am new to this group. I am reading, now for the fifth time I think, "hagakure" wich I love. Such harch poetry and wisdom of life! And a window ino a time and an uncompromising way of thinking wich fasinates me so.The historical references are important too, but I'm not so much into the facts and the numbers themselves. I also love the "Lone Wolf And Cub" - series. And now I am looking fore something more to read.......I am not looking for something purely on factual history. I want something genuine, but focused maybe on the filosophy,ethics, ore tactics and arts of war of samuray and great Samuray minds. Oh..and I don't read Japanese.<br/>
<br/>
Demanding, no? I am Norvegian, and things like this are IMPOSSIBLE to come by here so I have to buy per mail or e-mail wich is fine, but It makes me unnable to check what I am buying before I pay.......so I hope someone has a good tip for me.<br/>
<br/>
Thank's<br/>
