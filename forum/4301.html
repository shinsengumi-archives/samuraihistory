(Sorry, the wife and I watched a Fuji news show this<br/>
week about Gyaru-go in Shibuya...the above is<br/>
supposedly "Arienai". Oh, this show was<br/>
interesting...of course we then went over to do some<br/>
shopping, and could have sworn we saw the silver<br/>
haired, overly-tanned joshi kosei the show was<br/>
interviewing...)<br/>
<br/>
I'd pay to see KimuTaku die also...heck yeah!<br/>

I haven't heard anything about what it is based on other than the accepted<br/>
story of Yoshistune. I think the point about "Takki" is that he is another<br/>
pretty boy from Johnny's Juniors Jimusho with good looks but no talent. The<br/>
only reason NHK picked him was his popularity among young teenage girls.<br/>
There are plenty of other younger stars with talent but NHK is looking at<br/>
the ratings.</div>

 </span></blockquote>Since no one else has answered this, I will attempt.<br/>
The Yoshitsune Taiga drama will be about the life of<br/>
Minamoto Yoshitsune, the younger brother of Minamoto<br/>
Yoritomo, the first Minamoto Shogun. Yoshitsune is a<br/>
historical figure, though much legend clouds fact. He<br/>
was a Minamoto general and primary field commander,<br/>
and after subjugating his unruly cousin Yoshinaka, he<br/>
succeeded in leading the Minamoto to victory against<br/>
the Taira clan. Once this was done, however, Yoritomo<br/>
took steps to eliminate all rivals for political<br/>
power, and this included Yoshitsune. Yoshitsune was<br/>
hunted down and killed, his wife, some followers, and<br/>
his sidekick Benkei at his side. <br/>
<br/>
I don't know the manga to which you refer, but unless<br/>
it's about this Yoshitsune, I doubt it's the basis for<br/>
the drama. Past Taiga drama have used literary sources<br/>
for inspiration (recent example being 1996's<br/>
"Hideyoshi" and 2003's "Miyamoto Musashi" drawing<br/>
heavily from Yoshikawa Eiji's work, though I'd<br/>
hesitate to say they were COMPLETELY based on his<br/>
books). <br/>
<br/>
Though with recent trends in Taiga drama, maybe Manga<br/>
is a possible source of their inspiration--they've<br/>
tried everything else to increase ratings.<br/>
<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-38339528">Shit I thing that would be a crazy ass movie and it would be original so it probably would make some cashflow. If I had to make a movie about the samurai I would have probably have Quentin Terranteno write the screen play, but I would also leave out the west side storie shit and add in Mary poppins.
