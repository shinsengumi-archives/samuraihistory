Despite what is commonly believed, samurai do still exist. Though they<br/>
were listed as extinct outside of captivity in the late 19th century,<br/>
breeding programs have been very successful of late and a number of<br/>
samurai have been released back in to the wild. Loss of habitat and<br/>
social standing continue to threaten them, but many specialists are<br/>
quietly confident that they will breed their numbers back to a<br/>
sustainable level.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>There are no real "sumurais lft". The S-A-murai class<br/>
was abolished during the Meiji period, 1872 if I<br/>
recall correctly. <br/>

Heh, heh, you mean releasing these captive-bred samurai to the wild is<br/>
morally wrong? Is it wrong for the captive-bred?  Or wrong for those who<br/>
might get hunted down and eaten by them?  :)  :)<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Zan, Angus is making a joke. A very very good, subtle<br/>
one. It's satirical answer. In other words, your<br/>
friend is correct--the samurai class was legislated<br/>
out of existence in the 19th century. <br/>
