 </span></blockquote>Yes, it's based (very loosely) on a true event, the Battle of Shiroyama,<br/>
but had more differences than similarities.<br/>
 <br/>
The 'last samurai' of the film, Ken Watanabe's character (or Tom<br/>
Cruise's character, I guess...), is based on Saigo Takamori. As for<br/>
their being a single actual last samurai, no. All samurai alive at the<br/>
time became the last samurai as soon as the Meiji government did away<br/>
with the samurai caste.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-867741294">Saigo Takamori was the leader of the Satsuma Rebellion.  I believe there is a book about him that refers to him at the "last samurai".<br/>
 <br/>
While I enjoyed the movie, it doesn't bare any relationship to history.<br/>
