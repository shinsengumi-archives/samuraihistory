<h3>research for a friend..</h3>
by <i>brixhammovies</i>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1339587639">Hi, a college friend posed this question to me, and  as i dont know of any such story,  i wondered if any of you have any information. She heard the story years ago and is now trying to trace it again, and get more facts. <br/>
The event is purported to have taken place in the 1860s or 70s, and concerns the murder, on a beach hidden by wooded cliffs, of two or three "shishi" during the Satsuma rebellion or related events, by 5 Americans. <br/>
Thats all my friend can remeber of the story, if it rings any bells please let us know - we would be fascinated.<br/>

 <br/>
The only thing i can think of in regards to this matter, is that "Shishi" was believed to be an imaginary "lion-like looking dog", placed at temple entrances in Japan. The only death close to such settings of a cliff, can be that of the ritual suicide of Saigo Takamori during September of 1877 on a hilltop in Kagoshima, which is a coast city. He was the aristocratic politician who led the Satsuma rebellion, but was one of 3 samurai who helped form the Japan army whom he turned against. This murder story your friend mentioned, have the liking of a rumor. The rebellion had nothing to do with another country. Only Samurai faught against the Meiji laws of the Japan army, in 1877 where about 21thousand perished...mmm...but I will follow this story up.<br/>

	It is more likely five Americans were murdered by five Shishi <br/>
("men of high purpose", patriots not lions). ALthough it could have <br/>
happened during the landings made by international forces when they <br/>
took the Satsuma batteries and destroyed them in August 1863. This <br/>
was in retribution for firing on foreign vessels. It might also have <br/>
occurred when foreign representatives were in Kagoshima to witness <br/>
the seppuku of the man responsible for the attack on Richardson <br/>
(Namamugi-jiken). However this would be highly unlikely.<br/>
	One event I would like to research more is the incident at <br/>
Sakai, where 9 French sailors were massacred by Tosa troops en route <br/>
to attack Edo. BUT because this was late in the game and "the Regime <br/>
change" followed shortly thereafter the European powers took little <br/>
notice of the deaths. I've not been able to find much on this in <br/>
print but have always wanted to learn more.(The European governments <br/>
of the time were very much involved in the events of the Restoration, <br/>
though it suited all concerned to let it play out as a "civil" war.)<br/>
	I have to agree with Tony and Hiraizumi Sensei, Saigo as <br/>
warmonger was the story put out by Okubos' propaganda machine. There <br/>
are very good reasons for his wanting to put himself at the center of <br/>
the Korean question. If you agree with Yates' ideas they are easily <br/>
explainable. The saddest part is that inspite of the Okubo <br/>
governments public protestations to the contrary they followed the <br/>
very same course of action proposed by Saigo just five years after <br/>
the Satsuma rebellion was put down.<br/>
