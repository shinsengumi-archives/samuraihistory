Searching the records will be a huge task, considering all the changes<br/>
in Japan over the last 150 years.  <br/>
<br/>
Might I also suggest a trip to the library for a book on 'how to' do a<br/>
genealogical search?  Even a well-documented American ancestry can be<br/>
difficult with all the correspondence and details. O have a family<br/>
history that goes back to William of Orange, and several of my family<br/>
members worked for almost ten years to accumulate all that information.<br/>
<br/>
Best,<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Just an aside to this whole thing: When the original<br/>
poster first asked about the Miura, several people,<br/>
myself included, gave him the information that we<br/>
knew. That's what we're here for--when you ask a<br/>
question, we'll try to give you answers or point you<br/>
in the right direction. However, we're not going to<br/>
research anyone's genealogy for them. I can give you<br/>
information about the Miura clan of Sagami, but I<br/>
can't connect the dots for you to show you how you are<br/>
related or not related to them. That's up to the<br/>
individual who wants to know. <br/>
<br/>
If you ask a question here and don't get an answer,<br/>
chances are it's because no one here knows the answer<br/>
or where to find it. No one has some massive store of<br/>
"All Information Japanese" and is keeping it from you<br/>
in a nasty display of spitefulness. <br/>

 </span></blockquote>But unlike in the US, you have family registers in<br/>
Japan, which track everyone and everything--birth,<br/>
death, marriage, divorce, etc. As long as he can make<br/>
a connection to an existing family register, he<br/>
shouldn't have any problem getting more information.<br/>

advised to look at them, as this is not a genealogy forum.</div>
