<br/>
Ronin or "wave man" is a samurai without a master.<br/>
They have either been released from service, their<br/>
lord is dead, their clan has been shattered, they<br/>
committed an act that resulted in them being cast out.<br/>
These are some of the reasons one woul become ronin.<br/>
<br/>
During the early Tokugawa period there was estimated<br/>
to be close to 400,000 Ronin in Japan. The reason for<br/>
this was the disbanding of many defeated clans after<br/>
the Battle of Sekigahara (1600) by the victorious<br/>
Tokugawa Shogunate. These Ronin would figure<br/>
prominantly in the Osaka Campaigns of 1614-1615 on the<br/>
Toyotomi side and during the Shimabara Rebelion of<br/>
1637-1638 on the rebel side. These Ronin took any<br/>
chance to strike back at the those who made them Ronin<br/>
namely the Shogunate and their Hatamoto. The Ronin are<br/>
often depicted as the champion of the peasant and as a<br/>
dangerious man during the Tokugawa Period. Many of<br/>
these Ronin also found service in the Tozama<br/>
Clans(outside clans) such as the Shimazu and Nabeshima<br/>
Clans.<br/>
<br/>
Ronin Samurai also figured prominantly during the<br/>
Meiji Restoration and the downfall of the Shogunate in<br/>
1867-1868.<br/>
