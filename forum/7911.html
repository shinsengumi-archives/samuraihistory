<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1885320123">Please anyone, especially those who have seen this film. Feel free to jump<br/>
in here. See the post I cited below my reply. I snipped out all from the<br/>
post other than the parts relevant to this particular discussion.<br/>
<br/>
Not all issues of history concern historical fact. Some issues do. Such as<br/>
the dates when certain events happened. We do know that on Dec. 14, 1702,<br/>
that a number of former retainers of Lord Asano Nagayori attacked the<br/>
mansion of Lord Kira Yoshinaka. Now, there is a dispute and disagreement<br/>
among various scholars whose sources I've consulted as to the actual number<br/>
of former Ako retainers who attacked. Some say that there were 47, some say<br/>
that there were 46. So there you go, what would seem to be empirical<br/>
historical fact (that 47 former Ako retainers attacked Lord Kira Yoshinaka<br/>
on Dec. 14, 1702) is actually under dispute. But the date is established as<br/>
fact. <br/>
<br/>
But studying history also involves studying concepts, trends, ideas. Which<br/>
are not always supported by facts that everyone agrees with i.e. the date of<br/>
a certain event. <br/>
<br/>
Concerning the film SEPPUKU. Let's define "entertainment. As defined on<br/>
Dictionary.com<br/>
<br/>
"en*ter*tain*ment    ( P )  Pronunciation Key  (ntr-tnmnt)<br/>
n. <br/>
The act of entertaining. <br/>
The art or field of entertaining. <br/>
Something that amuses, pleases, or diverts, especially a performance or<br/>
show. <br/>
The pleasure afforded by being entertained; amusement: The comedian<br/>
performed for our entertainment. <br/>
Archaic. Maintenance; support. <br/>
Obsolete. Employment."<br/>
<br/>
I would question that the film SEPPUKU fits under this definition. When I've<br/>
seen it, I have not been either amused, pleased, nor diverted. Instead, I've<br/>
been confronted with the issues and ideas that the film presents. The<br/>
filmmaker, Kobayashi Masaki, and the novelist, Takiguchi Yasuhiko (upon<br/>
whose work the film is based), imply have the presented issues have a<br/>
historical basis, though their works are presented in fictional form. The<br/>
film has raised my curiosity and made me want to seek actual historical<br/>
evidence that events similar to the ones depicted in SEPPUKU may or may not<br/>
have happened. This list and the learned members here, are one of the<br/>
sources I am consulting to seek out possible information.  <br/>
<br/>
I will readily agree with you that SEPPUKU does not depict historical fact.<br/>
Nor is it intended to do so. But SEPPUKU isn't either pure fantasy or<br/>
science fiction. There are historical facets that we know are true, such as<br/>
that in the 17th century, Japan was united under the rule of the Tokugawa<br/>
shogunate. Also that many fiefs were abolished as a part of the<br/>
establishment of this rule. <br/>
<br/>
What is fictional, and not claimed to be fact, is that a ronin, Tsugumo<br/>
Hanshiro, killed many members of the Ii clan in avenging the death of his<br/>
son-in-law. I am not seeking historical information on a man named Tsugumo<br/>
Hanshiro, as I'm certain that historically, he never existed.<br/>
<br/>
But I can look at this film and see that it brings up historical issues that<br/>
I wish to explore. Which I am currently doing. Someone on another forum has<br/>
informed me of some possible historical sources that may claim to reveal<br/>
whether or not events that are similar to those depicted in SEPPUKU may have<br/>
acually occurred. That's what I'm looking at. But also, I look at the issues<br/>
raised for a general discussion of history as it happened in 17th century<br/>
Japan. <br/>
<br/>
So no, studying a film like SEPPUKU is NOT the same as studying the written<br/>
works of (as an example) Fumazawa Banzin, a scholar who lived and wrote<br/>
during the 17th century about issues that were contemporary for him during<br/>
the time that he lived. Nor is it like studying a work such as those written<br/>
by Stephen Turnbull or George Sansome or Donald Keene, who are contemporary<br/>
writers who seek to document dates and other events in what they see as a<br/>
factual basis.    <br/>
<br/>
But studying a film like SEPPUKU is not the same as studying entertainment<br/>
(such as the ZATOICHI films) and attempting to claim that it is historical<br/>
fact when films like these clearly do fit the definition of "entertainment"<br/>
as defined above.<br/>
<br/>
I'm probably as clear as mud here. I hope I've not confused anyone too<br/>
badly.<br/>

that's entertainment. <br/>

Certainly you could use the movie to discuss the situation of the times that<br/>
the movie depicts. Does it represent historical fact? No. Can it give you<br/>
insight into historical facts? Quite possibly. It's still not historical<br/>
record, NOR IS IT INTENDED TO BE. You keep saying that even books intended<br/>
to be history need to be checked and verified and (with as much as you say<br/>
it) believed only skeptically--HOW MUCH MORE A WORK OF FICTION?<br/>

<h3>Re: SEPPUKU: purely  &quot;entertainment&quot; or possibl e historical source? (was re: Sword Is The Soul Of The Samurai?</h3>

I found the film "Seppuku" very entertaining, even using your dictionary definition of it. I was 'pleased' with the art direction, the performances, sets, lighting, editing, costuming, the climatic sword fight, and the attention to period detail. Primarily I was pleased that what could have turned out to be just another hack Grade B 'noble ronin film' (although these entertain me as well) turned out to have a solid story that raised questions about the conflicting duties of the samurai class and made you think. Although the film was a tragedy, I found it had many moments that amused me (like the top-knot throwing) and it was certainly diverting-despite the long running time, I never found myself losing interest or clock watching. Entertainment is more than just watching action scenes or things getting "blowed up real gud"-it also includes enjoyment of a well done story.<br/>
As far as using this or any film as an historical source...I don't see it. I agree with one of the other posters that in this regard, films are best used as 'jumping off points' to inspire someone to conduct further research. Even films that pride themselves on being 'historically accurate' are anything but. The producers and cast thought Cruise's 'The Last Samurai' was extremely historically accurate-and we all know the general consensus of how the listmembers see that! Even a generally well thought of 'historical' film like 'Samurai Banners' is loaded with errors. This is due to editing concerns, budget restrictions, story flow, etc. Yes, one may be able to glean certain facts from a film, but I see the 'research payoff table' as a graduated list with films and video games (both of which I love) on one end with primary source documents on the other (followed by serious historians). Both may have errors (even the excellent reference work the 6 volume Cambridge History Of Japan has errors, some of them quite unexcusable), but you're far more likely to find solid answers among the source documents and serious historians. I see it as films inspiring one to ask questions, but the books and documents providing the best and most well-informed answers. <br/>
Except for a handful of 'art' films, the primary function of a film is to make money for the studio or group that financed it. For all the awards and critical acclaim Kurosawa had, when his films began to lose money, he found it almost impossible to get backing to make more. When it's a question of being historically accurate or entertaining, entertaining is going to win because that is what sells tickets. When it's a question of being historically accurate or coming in under budget/on time, the money people are usually going to win. Thankfully, while books do sometimes have to make certain concessions to publishers, this usually doesn't affect content in a non-fiction book.</div>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-442665096">Hi.<br/>
<br/>
Seppuku is probably most appropriately classified as a jidaigeki of the fictional sort. It is <br/>
not a documentary and does not pretend to be one. It does not even pretend to be a <br/>
fictionalization of a historical event such as Samurai Banners and Kagemusha are. That <br/>
said, they serve the same sort of function as say The Patriot does for understanding the <br/>
U.S. Revolutionary War. <br/>
<br/>
Is it a historical source? By in large, no. Is it purely "entertainment", I think that this is too <br/>
harsh. Chanbara films are much more of the entertainment variety, but even here the well <br/>
made chanbara film, such as Yojimbo, can expose the novice to the atmosphere of the <br/>
periond in which it is set.</div>
