<h3>Confused about Nobukado&#39;s end</h3>
by <i>shinobij</i>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-310730010">I've been looking into Takeda Nobunaga. I haven't found out all that much information but what I have found out seems comfusing. On Wikipedia it claims he died at the battle of Nagashino (it states the reference of this is Turnbulls Samurai Sourcebook". However on the Samurai Acrchives site, in the section on the Takeda generals, it claims he fought at Nagashino but was beheaded by Oda troops in Shinano province while fleeing the Takeda lands when Nobunaga invaded.<br/>
 <br/>
I would appreciate it if someone could clear this up for me. Thanks a lot.<br/>

the question in a week or so, I'll be able to give you an answer.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>There was no "Takeda Nobunaga". Do you mean Takeda<br/>
Katsuyori? Getting the name wrong is probably 99% of<br/>
your problem.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>I believe he means Takeda Nobukado from the sounds of things. I've<br/>
always thought he died in 1582, though I don't remember where I read<br/>
this. I'll take a look at my books when I get home from work and see if<br/>
I can find a source.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>   If the book I'm currently reading[1] can be believed, he died in <br/>
1582,  when the vanguard led by Oda Nobutada caught up with him as he <br/>
was attempting to retreat to Kōfu without having put up any resistance <br/>
when the Oda army invaded.<br/>
