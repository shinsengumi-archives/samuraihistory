<div id="ygrps-yiv-1731358968">Hi.<br/>
<br/>
In most cases, there is no, repeat no, fixed mapping between family  <br/>
name and kamon. There are kamon dictionaries which list family names  <br/>
associated with individual kamon, but that is as close as you can  <br/>
get. If you are able to do detailed geneological research and you  <br/>
happen to be particularly lucky, you may be able to trace an  <br/>
individual back to a premodern kamon used during the Sengoku period  <br/>
or earlier. However, this is a distinct minority of cases. A lot of  <br/>
Japanese families which claim ownership of some kamon or other can  <br/>
only trace this use back to the late 19th century when all Japanese  <br/>
were given permission to adopt kamon.<br/>
<br/>
According to Shintoh Kenjiro in &#22995;&#27663;&#23478;&#32011;&#12398;&#36766;&#20856; there is a  <br/>
Shijoh 四条 family descended from the Northern Fujiwara in the third  <br/>
generation. However, this line is not common enough for the kamon in  <br/>
question to appear in the book.<br/>
<br/>
Regardless. The following web page claims to have an entry for the  <br/>
Shijoh family.<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
It is called the &#30000;&#23383;&#33609;&#32011; (denjisômon).<br/>
<br/>
It is the second kamon from the left on the top row on the following  <br/>
web page.<br/>
<br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.harimaya.com/o_kamon1/zukan/syokubt.html">http://www.harimaya.com/o_kamon1/zukan/syokubt.html</a><br/>
<br/>
Or more specifically:<br/>
<br/>
￼<br/>
You can check out the actual plant at the following web page:<br/>

<br/>
Again, there is no particular reason to believe that the family in  <br/>
question has any historical use of this kamon.<br/>
<br/>
Best Wishes.<br/>
