<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I'm sorry to say, that these are purely fictional characters, from the<br/>
movie "The Last Samurai". Katsumoto is a stand-in for Saigo Takamori,<br/>
the real historical person, who has been described as "the last true<br/>
samurai". The film is nothing like the history. Likewise, no American<br/>
samurai either. This was just a viewpoint character to enable westerners<br/>
to glimpse Japanese culture, or at least Hollywood's version of it.<br/>
<br/>
Anyway, see this short piece on Saigo Takamori:<br/>

 </span></blockquote>What Kitsuno is gruffly saying is that Nathan Algren<br/>
and Katsumoto are fictitious--neither existed.<br/>

I have the name of a site that discusses matches performed by ex-samurai<br/>
after the Meiji reformation. They engaged in prize-fight sorts of matches.<br/>
This particular article discusses female ex-samurai in particular and the<br/>
development of various schools of naginata. But the article discusses these<br/>
matches. Here would be the relavant section of the article. <br/>

In the early Meiji period, there was another impetus for the development of<br/>
competitive martial sports This was the phenomenon of roving martial<br/>
"carnivals" known as gekken kogyo (gekken means "attacking sword"; kogyo<br/>
means "a show"). Some former samurai, down on their luck, joined forces in<br/>
traveling exhibitions, giving demonstrations and taking challenges from the<br/>
audiences. Mounting the stage, fighters would challenge all comers from the<br/>
audience, using wooden or bamboo swords, naginata, spear, chain-and-sickle,<br/>
or any other weapon selected by the challenger. These fights were very<br/>
popular and well written up in the newspapers. Although the fighters<br/>
probably tried to exert some control, there were many injuries. In addition<br/>
to challenge matches, members of the troop would engage each other in<br/>
"combat," and among the most popular would be a woman with a wooden naginata<br/>
against a man armed with a wooden or bamboo replica of a sword.<br/>
-------------------------------<br/>
<br/>
As for during the actual samurai eras (before 1868): I know that there were<br/>
incidences of "dojo crashing" which have been portrayed in various samurai<br/>
movies (chambara). Other than that, I know very little.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>There is a film, quite good. It's called AFTER THE RAIN, which deals with <br/>
this subject. I forget the director but it's not really a sword-slashing <br/>
"chambara film," it's a thoughtful film about what kenjutsu/kendo actually is. It's <br/>
available fairly widely with English subtitles. <br/>
<br/>
The plot of AFTER THE RAIN basically involves a ronin and his wife who are <br/>
traveling as he is looking for work. It turns out that he had made some income <br/>
in the past by engaging in "prize fighting" also known as "dojo crashing." <br/>
Though you will see in watching the film that this ronin had a different approach <br/>
rather than the usual brash, outrageous sort of approach because this man is <br/>
quite self-effacing. <br/>
<br/>
At any rate, the local daimyo finds out about this man and offers him an <br/>
interview for an open position he has in his clan of being a kendo instructor for <br/>
the clan. The ronin comes for the interview and in the process, the daimyo <br/>
finds out that he had engaged in "prize fighting" in the past and decides not to <br/>
take him into the clan. So yes, "prize fighting" was considered a dishonor. <br/>
The film goes on, and I'll let people watch it to find out what eventually <br/>
happens. <br/>
<br/>
I gather from this that "prize fighting" was considered a dishonor in the <br/>
same way that offering your sword services for hire was considered a dishonor. <br/>
The samurai was supposed to offer his sword skills freely, without consideration <br/>
for monetary gain, in service to his lord. That was the ethic of the day. <br/>
<br/>
Of course this ethic didn't provide for any ronin who had lost his lord or <br/>
else had been dismissed by his lord from his position -- how are they supposed <br/>
to survive?  But then it was usually considered a dishonor to have become a <br/>
ronin, without a lord.  So there really weren't provisions made for them in <br/>
feudal society,  particularly Tokugawa-era society. The ronin just had to somehow <br/>
carry on the best as they could. So frequently, despite the stigma, they were <br/>
forced to offer up their sword skills for money or else engage in "prize <br/>
fighting." <br/>
<br/>
During the Sengoku era, many samurai lost their lords. Some of them were able <br/>
to get positions within other clans because there were many battles and a <br/>
good swordsman, even one without a lord, would be welcomed into a clan, where he <br/>
could acquire a new lord to serve as a samurai. With the advent of the <br/>
Tokugawa period, there were far fewer opportunities, almost none, to acquire a new <br/>
position with a new clan once a samurai had lost his lord.  <br/>
<br/>
Hope this helps a bit.  Nina</div>

At any rate, the local daimyo finds out about this man<br/>
and offers him an <br/>
interview for an open position he has in his clan of<br/>
being a kendo instructor for <br/>
the clan. The ronin comes for the interview and in the<br/>
process, the daimyo <br/>
finds out that he had engaged in "prize fighting" in<br/>
the past and decides not to <br/>
take him into the clan. So yes, "prize fighting" was<br/>
considered a dishonor. <br/>
The film goes on, and I'll let people watch it to find<br/>
out what eventually <br/>
happens. <br/>
<br/>
I gather from this that "prize fighting" was<br/>
considered a dishonor in the <br/>
same way that offering your sword services for hire<br/>
was considered a dishonor. <br/>
The samurai was supposed to offer his sword skills<br/>
freely, without consideration <br/>
for monetary gain, in service to his lord. That was<br/>
the ethic of the day. <br/>
<br/>
Of course this ethic didn't provide for any ronin who<br/>
had lost his lord or <br/>
else had been dismissed by his lord from his position<br/>
-- how are they supposed <br/>
to survive?  But then it was usually considered a<br/>
dishonor to have become a <br/>
ronin, without a lord.  So there really weren't<br/>
provisions made for them in <br/>
feudal society,  particularly Tokugawa-era society.<br/>
The ronin just had to somehow <br/>
carry on the best as they could. So frequently,<br/>
despite the stigma, they were <br/>
forced to offer up their sword skills for money or<br/>
else engage in "prize <br/>
fighting." <br/>
<br/>
During the Sengoku era, many samurai lost their lords.<br/>
Some of them were able <br/>
to get positions within other clans because there were<br/>
many battles and a <br/>
good swordsman, even one without a lord, would be<br/>
welcomed into a clan, where he <br/>
could acquire a new lord to serve as a samurai. With<br/>
the advent of the <br/>
Tokugawa period, there were far fewer opportunities,<br/>
almost none, to acquire a new <br/>
position with a new clan once a samurai had lost his<br/>
lord.  <br/>
<br/>
Hope this helps a bit.  Nina<br/>

I thought it was Iaido/Iaijutsu since the ronin quite often practices his<br/>
iaido/iaijutsu kata while waiting for the rain to stop and on his journey in<br/>
the last minutes of the movie. But I really don't know his iaido/iaijutsu<br/>

Talking about good movie, have you watched  "when the last sword is drawn"?<br/>
This is a good movie too (at least that what i think).<br/>
 <br/>
here is the synopsis:<br/>
kanichiro Yoshimura is a family man and a samurai who can no longer feed his<br/>
wife and children due to the low wages paid by his small town clan.<br/>
Reluctantly, he decides to leave his loved ones and heads to the city to<br/>
join the large and renowned samurai faction, the Shinsen-gumi. Here he is<br/>
forced into a difficult existence during one of the most tumultuous times in<br/>
Japanese history. This wonderful gem of Japanese cinema is directed by<br/>
Yojiro Takita and written by Asada Jiro.<br/>

Hi, <br/>
 <br/>
I've seen this movie (Into the Sun) on DVD, overall it's good but I<br/>
personally am more interested in the empty handed (aikido) techniques of<br/>
Steven Seagal in his movies than his samurai swordsmanship. I also never<br/>
heard that he has trained samurai swordsmanship exclusively other than those<br/>
included in his aikido mokuroku (or i may be wrong?).<br/>
 <br/>
However, this one is also good if you really like watching samurai movies:<br/>
 <br/>
Samurai Resurrection:<br/>
This is the story of a Christian martyr who is killed when the uprising he<br/>
is leading is put down. Vowing vengeance he returns from the dead and with<br/>
the help of other unhappy souls he tries to destroy the shogun responsible<br/>
for his death. Opposing him is swordsman Jubei, who has to fight his way<br/>
through the undead minions in order to stop the plot to bring chaos to the<br/>
world. (The Jubei character was a real person and shows up in other Japanese<br/>
tales) This is the second version of a historically based supernatural<br/>
novel. The earlier film starred Sonny Chiba and was an action packed film<br/>
that made very little sense but was fun to watch. Here we have a nice blend<br/>
of action and plot, then again maybe its too much plot. While this is an<br/>
excellent action film, though the larger implications of who some of the<br/>
characters really are was lost on me since I'm not as well versed in<br/>
Japanese history. This is a film that assumes you know the period that the<br/>
film takes place since it brings many real people and places into play. Who<br/>
ever put the DVD I saw together must have been aware of the need to be<br/>
informed on Japanese history and customs so they included, as part of the<br/>
subtitled track, helpful tidbits about terms and people and places. It helps<br/>
in the short term but by half way into the film I was feeling a bit lost.<br/>
<br/>
Still this is a very good movie. The action is spectacular, the opening<br/>
castle assault is amazing, and the horror is scary, how the dead come back<br/>
will probably creep you out. This is a well thought out and well made<br/>
supernatural action film. I recommend it, with the understanding that you<br/>
may feel a bit lost (Though that's not a reason to pass this by since it is<br/>
a good film)<br/>

bad, but probably entertaining: CIA operative Travis Hunter (Steven <br/>
Seagal) gets the call to investigate the assassination of Tokyo's <br/>
governor. Raised by the yakuza, Hunter is forced to re-enter that <br/>
perilous underworld, where he discovers a terrorist ring spearheaded <br/>
by a yakuza leader with ties to the Chinese Mafia. Get ready for major <br/>
butt kicking as Hunter penetrates the yakuza's inner sanctum in this <br/>
direct-to-video thriller costarring Takao Osawa and William Atherton.</div>

There is also a realy good film <br/>
made by Steven Seagal called "Into the Sun"<br/>
the samurai sword action parts are so good. <br/>
here is the main story:<br/>
Travis Hunter (Steven Seagal) is an undercover agent<br/>
<cut>   <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Hi, <br/>
<br/>
I've seen this movie (Into the Sun) on DVD, overall it's good but I<br/>
personally am more interested in the empty handed (aikido) techniques of<br/>
Steven Seagal in his movies than his samurai swordsmanship. I also never<br/>
heard that he has trained samurai swordsmanship exclusively other than those<br/>
included in his aikido mokuroku (or i may be wrong?).<br/>
<br/>
However, this one is also good if you really like watching samurai movies:<br/>
<br/>
Samurai Resurrection:<br/>
This is the story of a Christian martyr who is killed when the uprising he<br/>
is leading is put down. Vowing vengeance he returns from the dead and with<br/>
the help of other unhappy souls he tries to destroy the shogun responsible<br/>
for his death. Opposing him is swordsman Jubei, who has to fight his way<br/>
through the undead minions in order to stop the plot to bring chaos to the<br/>
world. (The Jubei character was a real person and shows up in other Japanese<br/>
tales) This is the second version of a historically based supernatural<br/>
novel. The earlier film starred Sonny Chiba and was an action packed film<br/>
that made very little sense but was fun to watch. Here we have a nice blend<br/>
of action and plot, then again maybe its too much plot. While this is an<br/>
excellent action film, though the larger implications of who some of the<br/>
characters really are was lost on me since I'm not as well versed in<br/>
Japanese history. This is a film that assumes you know the period that the<br/>
film takes place since it brings many real people and places into play. Who<br/>
ever put the DVD I saw together must have been aware of the need to be<br/>
informed on Japanese history and customs so they included, as part of the<br/>
subtitled track, helpful tidbits about terms and people and places. It helps<br/>
in the short term but by half way into the film I was feeling a bit lost.<br/>
<br/>
Still this is a very good movie. The action is spectacular, the opening<br/>

<br/>
As i understand it, a samurai's status is determined by his place in<br/>
the social hierarchy, so that in the case of two samurai of equal<br/>
status, a priority would be determined if the master of one was of a<br/>
superior status than the master of the other.<br/>
<br/>
A samurai without employ is then 'cast adrift' in society, hence the<br/>
term ronin, he has no place at all, the only way is down. He becomes a<br/>
social pariah, is mistrusted and disliked, and someone turning up,<br/>
offering to fight for money, can only mean one thing ... trouble.<br/>
<br/>
Let alone the insult of assuming that a samurai would fight for<br/>
something like ... money?<br/>
<br/>
There is the added social stigma of losing to such a man. How can a<br/>
samurai hold his head high when he's been beaten by a beggar?<br/>
<br/>
On the other hand, swordsmen of renown (or independent means) might<br/>
engage in a musa shugyo (musha shugyo?) which I have seen translated<br/>
as 'warrior pilgrimage'; 'dojo tour' and 'warrior way' ('michi', as<br/>
opposed to 'do').<br/>
<br/>
It is recorded of Bokuden, for example, that he travelled in style, a<br/>
caravan of some 60-odd in attendance, the equivalent of a daimyo<br/>
procession. Nobutsuna Kamiizumi did the same.<br/>
<br/>
In either case, the chance to engage in a friendly match with a master<br/>
can do one's reputation no harm, and there is always something to<br/>
learn. Both men would have been welcomed, even if technically 'ronin',<br/>
their reputations had won them social status.<br/>
