<div id="ygrps-yiv-1348305665">Hello, Mr. Wood. <br/>
<br/>
I think I got caught up in a different discussion on some other threads<br/>
concerning "modern samurai" and inserted the grammatical correction. Sorry<br/>
you were offended, I meant no offense. <br/>
<br/>
I'm going to address the two points in your post in different responses<br/>
because I don't want to bend anyone's ears too much in some of my rather<br/>
long-winded commentary. <g> In this post, I'll address the issue of ronin<br/>
and seppuku and the 47 Ronin. <br/>
<br/>
Yes, I read THE 47 RONIN STORY by John Allyn and I remember the part where<br/>
he explains that, as ronin (as opposed to samurai affiliated with a clan),<br/>
that the 47 Ronin would not normally have the right of seppuku. My own<br/>
research and other readings show that this statement is not true. Ronin<br/>
commmited seppuku throughout Japanese history and as far as I know, no one<br/>
ever questioned their right to do so. <br/>
<br/>
Just an aside: when studying historical events, it's best to consult more<br/>
than one source. I remember questioning this statement by Allyn (that ronin<br/>
were not entitled to commit seppuku) when I read his book and went to<br/>
consult other sources and accounts. What I found in most of these other<br/>
sources contradicts what Allyn had posited about ronin and seppuku. Mainly,<br/>
I found some original sources from the period when this event happened<br/>
(early 18th century); they are contained in English translation in Hiroaki's<br/>
book LEGENDS OF THE SAMURAI. These sources contradicted what Allyn stated.  <br/>
<br/>
John Allyn was, however, quite correct in that there was a discussion and<br/>
dispute over whether the 47 former Ako retainers should be allowed to commit<br/>
seppuku. In LEGENDS OF THE SAMURAI, Sato presented some writings by Japanese<br/>
scholars and officials of the early 18th century. These writings had varying<br/>
viewpoints on what penalty, if any, that the 47 Ako ronin should be subject<br/>
to. <br/>
<br/>
The debate that raged was over the fact that the 47 former Ako retainers had<br/>
commited a vendetta against the laws that were in effect at the time. In<br/>
those days, commiting a vendetta without having received official permission<br/>
was a crime that normally would merit execution as common criminals. So<br/>
normally, the former Ako retainers would merit that punishment -- whether<br/>
they were ronin, samurai, commoners, whoever.  It wasn't their position as<br/>
ronin in society that entered into this debate, it was the nature of the<br/>
laws that had been broken. <br/>
<br/>
Some of the bakufu officials believed that the 47 former Ako retainers<br/>
should be exonerated completely and allowed to return to their homes. They<br/>
reasoned that the 47 had corrected a bakufu mistake in that Lord Asano had<br/>
been punished but that Lord Kira had not been punished. By rights, they<br/>
argued, both parties should have been given the punishment of seppuku for<br/>
what had happened in the castle two years previously. Other bakufu officials<br/>
believed that, as the 47 Ako ronin had committed a vendetta without<br/>
government sanction, that they were therefore common criminals and should be<br/>
treated as such i.e. executed. A compromise was reached in that the Ako<br/>
ronin would have to die for their actions, but that they would be allowed to<br/>
die by seppuku rather than be executed as criminals. And that is what<br/>
happened. <br/>
<br/>
Hope this is helpful. Nina<br/>

As far as the rest of it goes Nina (the 47 Ronin story), I can see you have<br/>
let ego get involved and you are picking nits with grammer so I will not<br/>
comment on what you said next.  Somehow I feel it is a tone unworthy of this<br/>
topic.<br/>
