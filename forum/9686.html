 </span></blockquote>I doubt a "list" exists for that particular (and random) year - you'll<br/>
need to research - check out various clans, and see who was in charge<br/>
during that time and where, write them down, and move on to the next one.</div>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-983787255">Dear Kitsuno,<br/>
<br/>
Thank you for your reply.  I can't believe how phenomenally <br/>
difficult it is to piece together all this information...  Clearly, <br/>
record-keeping was not a priority for Samurai or Peasants during the <br/>
turbulent 1620's...  <br/>
<br/>
Can you recommend any well-organized books, periodicals, and/or <br/>
websites that provides comprehensive lists of Daimyos per regions?  <br/>
i.e. I am looking for a list Daimyos on Kyushu only.  <br/>
<br/>
Alternatively, do you know where I can locate information on all the <br/>
Daimyos in Japan in control in the 1620's only?  I could then sort <br/>
the regions manually myself.<br/>
<br/>
At present, all I can find is some big old Alphabetical list of <br/>
Daimyos and/or Samurai families across all of Japan and across <br/>
multiple centuries...  which isn't very helpful.  Overall, I'd hate <br/>
to reinvent the wheel if there already exists comprehensive records <br/>
or study in this area.<br/>
<br/>
Any advice would be greatly appreciated.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks in advance,<br/>
<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Record-keeping has always been an obsession throughout Japanese<br/>
history. Every clan has detailed genealogies and detailed clan<br/>
histories. If you can't read Japanese, you are more limited, but I'd<br/>
just be creative - I would first find a map something like this one:<br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.samurai-archives.com/maphome.html">http://www.samurai-archives.com/maphome.html</a><br/>
Then I would write down the names of all of the daimyo I see on<br/>
Kyushu, and then I would get various library books that deal with<br/>
Japanese history, flip to the index, and try to find out who was in<br/>
charge of the clan during the 1620s - off the top of my head, George<br/>
Sansom's 2nd and/or 3rd book (History of Japan) would be one place to<br/>
look. It's pretty basic research. If you read Japanese, the Japanese<br/>
wikipedia and harimaya.com has detailed family trees for almost every<br/>
major clan, and the Sengoku Jinmei Jiten edited by Abe would be<br/>
another resource. I'd help out, but I don't have the time. Maybe<br/>
someone else around here?<br/>
<br/>
Also, I'm curious - what "turbulence" are you talking about during the<br/>
1620s? I can't think of much of anything overly turbulent happening in<br/>
the 1620s aside from the non-event of Iemitsu becoming shogun, and the<br/>
start of Sakoku.</div>

You are quite right.  Samurai record-keeping appears to be quite <br/>
meticulous, and there appears to be a lot of information, albeit I <br/>
can't seem to find it in "summary" form, or in a fashion that <br/>
doesn't require a lot of filtering... and a lot of work...<br/>
<br/>
I think my "turbulence" statement was a relative one.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks,<br/>

Shaun<br/>
<br/>
P.S.  As recommended, I purchased the books by G.B. Sansom.  I'm <br/>
also considering purchasing the History of Japan volumes by James <br/>
Murdoch.  Have you read these?  Are they any good?<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1541453208">Dear Shaun, Kitsuno.<br/>
<br/>
Do I see a slight mental block appearing!.... I think that 1625 - 1640 <br/>
was a very interesting and turbulent period in Kyushu. Having spent the <br/>
last four years researching and writing (with Till Weber) about the <br/>
Shimabara Rebellion and the period leading up to it I would say that it <br/>
was a pivotal point in Japan's history. One of these days soon I will <br/>
send the manuscript off for publication. But in the meantime Shaun, I <br/>
would suggest you look at the Shimabara Rebellion [insurrection or <br/>
whatever you prefer to call it] and you will discover a wealth of <br/>
information about the Daimyo in Kyushu at that time.<br/>
<br/>
Best wishes,<br/>

 </span></blockquote>I considered that, but I was referring to the 1620's.  The majority of<br/>
the action was in the 1630's, so I still maintain that not much "epic<br/>
and turbulent" went on in the 1620's compared to the 1610's or the<br/>
1630's.  It was pretty tame in comparison.</div>
