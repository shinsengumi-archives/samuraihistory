<h3>&quot;Secret of the samurai&quot; criticism</h3>
by <i>cez_72</i>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1922559294">Hello everyone. I'm an almost-35 year old male samurai enthusiast. <br/>
I'm interested in everything Japanese in general, but in samurai <br/>
history in particular. I watch chanbara movies, read Turnbull-<br/>
sensei's books, play oriental role-playing games, that sort of things.<br/>
<br/>
I was reading the "Specific ninja misconceptions" page, like a good <br/>
newbie, and having a good laugh out of it - even if it's nothing <br/>
really new to me, fortunately - when I stumbled upon this sentence:  <br/>
<br/>
<<Even "history" books may not be legit--see "Secrets of the <br/>
Samurai", which is, quite honestly, a pile of pig feces.>><br/>
<br/>

<br/>
I own a copy of "Secrets of the Samurai" by Oscar Ratti and Adele <br/>
Westbrook, which is, for what I seem to remember, a very informative <br/>
and accurate book, packed full of useful info. Maybe I'm ignoring or <br/>
forgetting something? I would like to know exactly what's the problem <br/>
with this text.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks,<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I have the book, but have never read it, and also didn't write that<br/>
"critique", but right now flipping through the book, the only thing I<br/>
can assume without actually reading it is that it might severely<br/>
overplay the importance of bujutsu and could be based on myths and<br/>
misinformation that go along with Bujutsu like cake with ice cream.  I<br/>
notice that there are some actual history books listed along with<br/>
articles out of "black belt" magazine.  I don't know of any<br/>
university-published books on Japanese history that have anything at<br/>
all to do with Bujutsu, so I'm wondering how these books were put to<br/>
use in the writing of "Secrets of the Samurai".  I'm interested to<br/>
hear the opinions of people who have actualy read (and apparently<br/>
hated) it.<br/>
<br/>
I must say that the section on "Kiaijutsu" starting on p. 406 gives me<br/>
major pause:<br/>
<br/>
"Few details are available about the actual training techniques which<br/>
were used to develop that preliminary unification of powers in the<br/>
hara which allowed certain bujin to paralyze, kill, or, on the other<br/>
hand, save another warriors's life via a concentrated shout."<br/>
<br/>
Um... what? Man, no wonder Hideyoshi couldn't take Korea, he didn't<br/>
have enough Kiai-Bujin to yell at the enemy.</div>

 </span></blockquote>I *DID* write the article on ninja, and yes, there you<br/>
have it. At the risk of riling up the martial artists<br/>
out there, the book definitely overplays the whole<br/>
bujutsu/bushido thing. I'm also not the only person<br/>
who's been critical of it--the book tries to come off<br/>
as a samurai "handbook", and is certainly not an<br/>
academic study. <br/>
<br/>
I wouldn't classify my feelings towards it as<br/>
"hate"--it's simply a cog in the "Bullshido" machine. <br/>

 </span></blockquote>No further statements, your honor.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Hehehehehe. I see your point. <br/>
On the other hand, it doesn't say it actually worked, does it? ;)<br/>
