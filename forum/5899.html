<br/>
Synopsis:<br/>
This DVD set contains two separate films by Takeshi Kitano. Sonatine <br/>
was released in 1993. Zatoichi was released in 2003. The following <br/>
are the descriptions from the DVD covers:<br/>
<br/>
"ZATOICHI: THE BLIND SWORDSMAN: In an empire ruled by fear, the <br/>
people's only hope is the ultimate weapon: Zatoichi (Kitano) -- a <br/>
blind, nomadic samurai whose sword has made him a hero and whose <br/>
courage has made him a legend! Determined to help the desperate <br/>
residents of a village, Zatoichi seeks justice through revenge!<br/>
<br/>
SONATINE: A seasoned mobster travels to Okinawa on a "peace-keeping" <br/>
mission, even though he suspects that his boss is secretly trying to <br/>
eliminate him! Determined to not go down without a fight, he and his <br/>
gang know exactly what they have to do!"<br/>
<br/>
Zatoichi is rated R for strong stylized bloody violence. Sonatine is <br/>
rated R for bloody shootings, language, and some sexuality.<br/>
<br/>
The Movie:<br/>
I had a strange revelation after watching Sonatine and Zatoichi. The <br/>
whole time I thought the star, Takeshi Kitano (aka Beat Takeshi), <br/>
looked very familiar, but I couldn't figure out where I knew him <br/>
from. At the conclusion of Sonatine, Quentin Tarantino remarks that <br/>
he's primarily known for being a comedic actor. It's then I realized <br/>
where I knew him from. He's Vic Romano from "Most Extreme <br/>
Elimination Challenge" on Spike TV. I was stunned and amused by the <br/>
revelation. It's like figuring out that dramatic actor Robin <br/>
Williams was Mork from Ork. In any case, it's a testament to the <br/>
guy's acting ability. He goes from being a clown on a Japanese game <br/>
show to being either a blind samurai or a yakuza gangster with ease. <br/>
To top it all off he wrote and directed both films. That's an <br/>
amazing accomplishment no matter how you look at it.<br/>
<br/>
Of the two films included on this DVD "double feature", I liked "The <br/>
Blind Swordsman: Zatoichi" the best. The film is of the samurai <br/>
genre. Zatoichi is a blind former samurai who travels the country <br/>
helping people. In this film he gets in some very impressive <br/>
swordfights. They are also notable because they feature CGI blood <br/>
spurts. When Zatoichi slashes someone, it sprays out in graphic <br/>
displays. I don't recall seeing CGI used in swordfights like this <br/>
before. The fights are also notable because the battles don't last <br/>
more than one or two moves. Usually someone is slashed in short <br/>
order and it's over with. But besides the fights, there is some <br/>
impressive scenery, beautiful period costumes, and very detailed <br/>
sets. It's a great looking film. The story is also good, too. It <br/>
builds up to a confrontation between Zaotichi and a ronin Samurai <br/>
acting as a bodyguard for the main villain of the movie. While their <br/>
final confrontation is a bit anticlimactic, the buildup to it is <br/>
good. However, at the very end of the movie it takes a very bizarre <br/>
twist. The surviving characters celebrate by breaking into a tap <br/>
dance routine. Yup. Up until that point it was very much a period <br/>
piece, but then it turns into Japanese Riverdance. It was odd, but I <br/>
guess Japanese audiences liked it.<br/>
<br/>
The second film is Sonatine. This one is quite different from <br/>
Zatoichi. It falls into the gangster / yakuza genre. Takeshi Kitano <br/>
again impresses with a dramatic performance. He also handles the <br/>
action well. This film is notable for its particularly vicious <br/>
gunfights that pop up out of nowhere. They are spontaneous and <br/>
stunning because of their intensity. However, when the Takeshi and <br/>
his gang hide out at a beach house from the other yakuza, it takes a <br/>
particularly boring turn. You see over an hour of these gangsters <br/>
going through male bonding. They shoot cans off of each others <br/>
heads, dig in the sand, sumo wrestle, and more. This gets a bit <br/>
tedious until the action starts again. <br/>
<br/>
If you like Asian films, action films, samurai movies, or gangster <br/>
movies, then you'll definitely want to check out this DVD. And if <br/>
you like MXC, you'll want to check out Vic Romano in full bloody <br/>
action.<br/>
<br/>
The Extras:<br/>
There are a few extras included on this DVD:<br/>
<br/>
ZATOICHI:<br/>
<br/>
Behind the Scenes Special  This is your standard "making of" video. <br/>
It follows the production from the initial press conference all the <br/>
way up to its premiere. You see them rehearse the swordfights, <br/>
practice the tap dancing number, filming on location, and more. It's <br/>
a very in-depth look at the making of the movie.<br/>
<br/>
Video Interview with the crew (cinematographer, production designer, <br/>
costume designer, master swordsman)  These short interviews feature <br/>
a number of the key crew from the film. My favorite was with the <br/>
master swordsman. He talked about the style of sword fighting used <br/>
in the film, how he worked with Takeshi, and more.<br/>
<br/>
SONATINE:<br/>
<br/>
Beat Takeshi Interview  For a man that does everything, Takeshi <br/>
seems awfully camera shy. Despite this, he talks at length about <br/>
filming his movies, Quentin Tarantino, and more. Fans of his will <br/>
enjoy this. You definitely gain greater appreciation for his work <br/>
after seeing this.<br/>
<br/>
Prologue and Epilogue by Quentin Tarantino  Tarantino delivers a <br/>
sometimes rambling intro and "outro" to the film. He talks about how <br/>
great Takeshi is, how Sonatine revolutionized yakuza films, what <br/>
Japanese moviegoing culture is like, and more. It's cool to see that <br/>
he's such a big fan, but it definitely seems like he does this talk <br/>
on the fly.<br/>
<br/>
The Bottom Line: <br/>
If you like Asian action movies, you'll probably enjoy Zatoichi and <br/>
Sonatine. They are from two very different genres, but they have a <br/>
lot to offer in the way of action, exotic setting, and drama.<br/>
