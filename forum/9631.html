I know that the Taira colour was a darker green when at their height of power.<br/>
And also the Takeda had a very similar if not same shade of green during their greatest era.<br/>
<br/>
I have seen the colours associated with clan mons for years upon years of research into Japanese culture and history, particularly medieval history but cannot remember the sources - but if you patiently search for them you should not have too much difficulty locating them.<br/>
