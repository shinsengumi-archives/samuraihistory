 <br/>
Out of interest, what does this word "honor" mean to you? I believe this concept is a sort of fake conciencnesse created created by the people at the top to make loyal soldiers to die for their battles battle. And in fact this "honor" is the most dishounarble thing to follow.<br/>
 <br/>
I believe the only honor is the honor to all of mankind and our fellow human beings. This honor includes not to kill another.<br/>
What does everybody else think?<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1014951781">To the samurai honor was everything, when they made challenges they would recite the deeds of their family. If you were dishonorable this would effect not only you but it would tarnish the names of your sons and their familys too.

What I wrote was as a response to what was wrote by Jonny (see below) that said that honor was something to keep the troops loyal. The point that I was trying to make, and perhaps I was not wording it in the right manner is that all the Japanese not just the samurai class placed great importance on the reputation of themselves and their familys. Akechi Mitsuhide is regarded badly for his act against Nobunaga, his name is tarnished forever as well as the name of his family. The same would hold true if you were a peasant and your father were a criminal, you would be thought of as coming from a bad family. As far as calling out challenges and proclaiming your pedigree and the deeds of your ancestors, every text I have has dozens of acounts. I ain't no kid, I have read about this subject for many years and I will talk if I want to.. If you dissagree with me fine but a little manners on your part would be nice.<br/>

<h3>Re: Samurai</h3>
by <i>midorinotoradesu</i>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1798147548">Sir, I'd have to argue that honor is not forgotten.  There are men <br/>
and women today that fight and die with honor.I think that perhaps <br/>
your definition of honor is different than mine.  I see that honor <br/>
and loyalty can be independent of eachother.  Honor is synonymous <br/>
with integrity.  The unfying moral character of a person that binds <br/>
them to do what is right at all time.  At times, having honor means <br/>
that you must overlook your loyalty to do what is right.  If I am <br/>
loyal to an evil Daimyo (shameless attempt to relate message to group <br/>
subject) does that make me a person with honor?  If I am carrying out <br/>
the orders of a ruthless bloodthirsty man, do I have honor?  The evil <br/>
in this world is as much the child of evil men as the good men who do <br/>
nothing about it. <br/>
In the military, having honor may mean disagreeing with your <br/>
superior.  In the case of war, it may mean disobeying an unlawful <br/>
order.  Under the Law of Armed Conflict, all military people are <br/>
taught to abide by certain rules of engagement.  It doesn't matter <br/>
how loyal you may be to your Commander.  If he orders an attack on an <br/>
illegal target; you disobey or you do not have honor...you have a <br/>
jail sentence with hard labor.<br/>
I think that most people have some sense of honor (maybe I'm wearing <br/>
rose colored glasses).  Most people care about how others see them.  <br/>
Honor in a small sense is what drives people to conform to social <br/>
norms.  Most people want to be good.  They want to do the right <br/>
thing.  <br/>
I do think loyalty is important.  It is paramount to use reason and <br/>
objectivity with loyalty or you could find yourself in deep poop.  <br/>
Doing the right thing is more important than pleasing the right <br/>
people.<br/>
(stepping off soapbox)<br/>

I hope that Kyle didn't upset you too much.  What you had said seemed <br/>
not only relevant but in line with what I have read and researched.  <br/>
You had a valid point.  Japan had a society built on a strong sense <br/>
of honor.  From the top to the bottom.  Although Samurai and Daimyos <br/>
were well known for manipulation, most of them believed in their <br/>
system of honor.  The film chushingura illustrates this very well.  <br/>
In fact, Japanese society is still built on honor.  Japan is a <br/>
conformist community.  You learn from a very young age that you must <br/>
fit into the norms of society.  If you do not, honor is lost/face is <br/>
lost.<br/>
  Suicide rates in Japan are amoung the highest in the world.   <br/>
That's not because teenage boys couldn't find a girlfriend.  <br/>
Students, businessmen, farmers, commit suicide because they cannot <br/>
bear the possibility that they bring shame upon their families.<br/>
For someone who cannot see the truth in your statement, such <br/>
blindness will prevent learning.  That's what this group is all <br/>
about.  Not making a snappy remark to make someone else look stupid.  <br/>
In this case, it was the snappy remark thet made Kyle look stupid.<br/>

Too many people, especially on these lists, want to<br/>
make honor something that only samurai or knights or<br/>
whomever in the past had. Guess what people--there<br/>
were dishonorable samurai, there were dishonorable<br/>
knights...there are honorable people today. Get over<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-2026282108">Please don't get me wrong, I am sure that there are a great deal of honourable people in modern Japan (perhaps more, perhaps less than elsewhere, who counts?) but I think what we see by and large is not 'honour' but 'face'. Recently the owner of a large Chicken company in Kyoto Prefecture and his wife committed suicide after the company had been found to have continued selling their produce despite a huge number of chicken deaths due to Chicken Influenza. He did not kill himself because of a dishonourable, dangerous business decision, but because he was found out by the authorities. This was no 'honourable' act of seppuku of death over surrender.<br/>
This tragic case is not alone. Reactionary bureaucratic corruption, a political and construction industry gravy train, marital infidelity, and widespread school bullying, to name a few other examples are rife (although obviously not just in Japan). A previous mailer correctly wrote that what is honourable is what is right (admittedly a subjective point of view, but there is always a certain lex naturae inherent in all societies), not just doing what is demanded of you (ie, obedience). Education in Japan, from Kindergarten to Uinversity is designed to cultivate a rigid hierarchical structure, where the uniformity of the 'ganbare' attitude creates soild, unsurprising employees, rather than aspiring individuals. Before anyone accuses me of Japan-bashing, I am not. I live in this society, am married into it, and now work within its education system. <br/>
The Chushingura epics, or other historical figures like Sugawara Michizane or Minamoto no Yoshitsune are exemplars to be looked upto in Japanese society, not models for life. <br/>

I hope that Kyle didn't upset you too much.  What you had said seemed <br/>
not only relevant but in line with what I have read and researched.  <br/>
You had a valid point.  Japan had a society built on a strong sense <br/>
of honor.  From the top to the bottom.  Although Samurai and Daimyos <br/>
were well known for manipulation, most of them believed in their <br/>
system of honor.  The film chushingura illustrates this very well.  <br/>
In fact, Japanese society is still built on honor.  Japan is a <br/>
conformist community.  You learn from a very young age that you must <br/>
fit into the norms of society.  If you do not, honor is lost/face is <br/>
lost.<br/>
  Suicide rates in Japan are amoung the highest in the world.   <br/>
That's not because teenage boys couldn't find a girlfriend.  <br/>
Students, businessmen, farmers, commit suicide because they cannot <br/>
bear the possibility that they bring shame upon their families.<br/>
For someone who cannot see the truth in your statement, such <br/>
blindness will prevent learning.  That's what this group is all <br/>
about.  Not making a snappy remark to make someone else look stupid.  <br/>
In this case, it was the snappy remark thet made Kyle look stupid.<br/>

The point that I was trying to make, and perhaps I was not wording it <br/>
in the right manner is that all the Japanese not just the samurai <br/>
class placed great importance on the reputation of themselves and <br/>
their familys. Akechi Mitsuhide is regarded badly for his act against <br/>
Nobunaga, his name is tarnished forever as well as the name of his <br/>
family. The same would hold true if you were a peasant and your <br/>
father were a criminal, you would be thought of as coming from a bad <br/>
family. As far as calling out challenges and proclaiming your <br/>
pedigree and the deeds of your ancestors, every text I have has <br/>
dozens of acounts. I ain't no kid, I have read about this subject for <br/>
many years and I will talk if I want to.. If you dissagree with me <br/>
fine but a little manners on your part would be nice.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>I agree with you 100%.  If we can agree that a lack of honor <br/>
(dishonor) and shame are the same thing.  Webster says they are.  So <br/>
I think were a looking at the same glass and describing the same <br/>
state in different terms.  <br/>
<br/>
To clarify, I don't think it's honorable to commit suicide.  I think <br/>
it is cowardly.  Even if it has something to do with honor.  Suicide <br/>
is refusing to deal with problems that face us and choosing to run <br/>
away from them.  It is not a solution, it is the ultimate escape.  <br/>
<br/>
To me, suicide and seppuku are also different.  Suicide is as I have <br/>
described, while seppuku was an honorable death.  The problems were <br/>
dealt with prior to choosing (or being volunteered for) seppuku.  <br/>
Samurai society was vastly different then.  People could choose <br/>
seppuku to show their integrity or show their strength of principles.  <br/>
Suicide isn't normally committed in such terms.<br/>
<br/>
Did you hear about the chicken farmer that committed suicide last <br/>
week?  <br/>

of WWII weren't all Nazis.  Japanese of the same period weren't all <br/>
monsters.  The thing I appreciate about eastern philosphy is that <br/>

good and bad.  There is good and bad in every culture, country, <br/>
city...  I just hope that there is more good than bad in the world.<br/>

The daimyo used bushido to keep troops loyal. Yes, some samurai <br/>

that. But these guys weren't the soldiers, they were the <br/>

You claim that all of Japan followed a system of honor... its true <br/>
that confucian principles were generally followed, but thats far <br/>
from a system of honor, especially what you're thinking about. Think <br/>
about it; if you're a farmer, and you toil all day and sleep what <br/>
little time you have off, what room is there for the "honor" that <br/>
you think everyone followed? that they were too tired to ever do <br/>
anything but be subserviant like the samurai the hagakure preaches <br/>
about may be true... but that wasn't really out of a sense of honor.<br/>
<br/>
I don't recall all samurai calling out challenges... only the noble <br/>

The point that I was trying to make, and perhaps I was not wording <br/>
it in the right manner is that all the Japanese not just the samurai <br/>
class placed great importance on the reputation of themselves and <br/>
their familys. Akechi Mitsuhide is regarded badly for his act <br/>
against Nobunaga, his name is tarnished forever as well as the name <br/>
of his family. The same would hold true if you were a peasant and <br/>
your father were a criminal, you would be thought of as coming from <br/>
a bad family. As far as calling out challenges and proclaiming your <br/>
pedigree and the deeds of your ancestors, every text I have has <br/>
dozens of acounts. I ain't no kid, I have read about this subject <br/>
for many years and I will talk if I want to.. If you dissagree with <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1948457362">Hey:<br/>
       Watakushi no kioku ga tashika naraba... (I think that's right -- my <br/>
"japanese lessons" include watching Iron Chef on the Food Network.)<br/>
       Did Mitsuhide not slay Nobunaga to get back at him for something or <br/>
other, perceived or real?  Or is that part of fictional lore?  And what would <br/>
have happened had Mitsuhide not taken the action?  In all honesty, I ask this <br/>
question: Might Hideyoshi have tired of being the right arm of Nobunaga and <br/>
simply turned on him and taken him out himself, ascending to where he ended up <br/>
anyway?  Or would he have been content to wait out Nobunaga's life and risk it <br/>
against the sons?<br/>
       Why do you consider Mitsuhide's move dumb?  As opposed to just plain <br/>
luckless?  It seems to me that the Mori not finding out about Nobunaga's demise <br/>
and Akechi's alliances crumbling wasn't something caused by stupidity, just <br/>
being in the wrong place at the right time, which can be attributed to being, <br/>
as I said before, just plain luckless.  I mean, it seems to me that Akechi <br/>
couldn't win for losing.  Same goes for Shibata, the other sons of Nobunaga and <br/>
everyone else except for Hideyoshi and Ieyasu.  And something Hideyoshi may have <br/>
done anyway, given the time.  Somehow, I don't think he shed any tears <br/>
whatsoever over Nobunaga's death.<br/>
       Just a couple questions.  :-D  Take care, y'all.  :-D<br/>

<h3>Re: Samurai</h3>
by <i>midorinotoradesu</i>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-998713802">Now Kyle, I like that.  You have been fair with all of us by <br/>
explaining what you meant. <br/>
<br/>
I do have some thoughts about the whole lineage thing.  I'm not an <br/>
expert, so I hope Tony will correct me if I'm way off.  I do believe <br/>
the practice of one on one combat existed in the early samurai <br/>
period.  Even in the Gempei war many challanges were shouted to foes <br/>
based on the existing honor system.  Many Samurai did call out their <br/>
lineage before a battle.  Although it seems silly to us now, we have <br/>
to remember how isolated Japan was from the rest of the world.  They <br/>
had a system of fighting wars that was very different than any <br/>
other...Until the Mongols invaded.  Then the Samurai began to wise <br/>
up.  "Hey, these Mongols don't really care about our family do they?"  <br/>
My understanding is that the Japanese were totally unprepared to <br/>
fight a war with an organized mongolian military machine.  The <br/>
Kamikaze came and literally saved Japan.  But the samurai were <br/>
prepared the second time, and the preparations/strategic philosophies <br/>
that followed changed the face of Samurai warfare.  <br/>
<br/>
Into the Sengoku is when Ashigaru are much more apparent in the <br/>
armies.  Long after the lineage practice had been proven unwise by <br/>
the Mongols (I know, they were actually Korean and Chinese <br/>
conscripts).  So at this point I can't see them doing it either.<br/>
<br/>
Many years later, after a couple hundred years of peace, under the <br/>
Tokugawa bakufu, Hagakure was written.  This is about the point that <br/>
Bushido is crystalized into what we know today.  Prior to the <br/>
peaceful Edo Jidai, much of the "honor sytem" wasn't based on those <br/>
high and holy precepts that everyone thinks the samurai lived by.  It <br/>
was only in the last years of the samurai that the bushido code would <br/>
influence the population.<br/>
<br/>
I guess, I too get a little sick of generalizations.  I recently went <br/>
to a banquet that had a presentation on Samurai and Kensei.  We were <br/>
informed that the Samurai lived by the Bushido code.  They were <br/>
warriors and role models that were bound by honor to better society.  <br/>
They helped everyone gain greater understanding by standing for <br/>
peace, justice, and the American way (well, they didn't really say <br/>
that, but they might as well have).  Upon hearing this, I could hear <br/>
Tony's voice with a resounding "Bunk!"  There were good and bad <br/>
Samurai.  They didn't all live honorable and they Bushido code didn't <br/>
affect most of the samurai period.  Surely, you must agree that they <br/>
had some system of honor.  How else could we quantify a good or bad <br/>
samurai?  But it wasn't "Bushido" persay.  Since "Bushido" did not <br/>
exist in the Sengoku, it probably wasn't used to keep the troops in <br/>
line.  I am sure that daimyo did manipulate their troops but it may <br/>
have been much more simple and less dubious than you presume.  <br/>
Promises of fame and fortune, political status, social status, pride, <br/>
and land are other methods that could be used to obtain loyalty.  <br/>
<br/>
In short, I don't think that there was a universal conspiracy by <br/>
leaders of the time, to devise a system to keep a brotha down.  That <br/>
was not the "purpose" of honor or bushido, although it (like anything <br/>
else) could be perverted and warped to serve sinister means.<br/>

  Try a little more than Shogun. Akechi Mitsuhide wouldn't have been <br/>
  thought so poor had he actually succeeded in becoming Shogun (his <br/>
  alliances not fallen apart, the mori finding out about nobunaga's <br/>
  death before hideyoshi). Don't kid yourself into think he really did <br/>
  anything special. Just dumb.<br/>
  The daimyo used bushido to keep troops loyal. Yes, some samurai <br/>
  really believed in it. Obviously, take a look at the Hagakure to see <br/>
  that. But these guys weren't the soldiers, they were the <br/>
  peacekeeping semi-beurocrats of the Edo jidai.<br/>
  You claim that all of Japan followed a system of honor... its true <br/>
  that confucian principles were generally followed, but thats far <br/>
  from a system of honor, especially what you're thinking about. Think <br/>
  about it; if you're a farmer, and you toil all day and sleep what <br/>
  little time you have off, what room is there for the "honor" that <br/>
  you think everyone followed? that they were too tired to ever do <br/>
  anything but be subserviant like the samurai the hagakure preaches <br/>
  about may be true... but that wasn't really out of a sense of honor.<br/>
<br/>
  I don't recall all samurai calling out challenges... only the noble <br/>
  ones. I doubt an ashigaru wielding a spear was shouting, "I am so-<br/>
  and-so, from so-and-so village! Come get some!"<br/>
<br/>
  And sorry about the snappy remarks... I'm just SICK of all these <br/>
  kids thinking the Hagakure is the book of every samurai for every <br/>
  age, and that Akechi Mitsuhide was a unique person for his actions. <br/>

  The point that I was trying to make, and perhaps I was not wording <br/>
  it in the right manner is that all the Japanese not just the samurai <br/>
  class placed great importance on the reputation of themselves and <br/>
  their familys. Akechi Mitsuhide is regarded badly for his act <br/>
  against Nobunaga, his name is tarnished forever as well as the name <br/>
  of his family. The same would hold true if you were a peasant and <br/>
  your father were a criminal, you would be thought of as coming from <br/>
  a bad family. As far as calling out challenges and proclaiming your <br/>
  pedigree and the deeds of your ancestors, every text I have has <br/>
  dozens of acounts. I ain't no kid, I have read about this subject <br/>
  for many years and I will talk if I want to.. If you dissagree with <br/>
  me fine but a little manners on your part would be nice.<br/>

and taking his place wasn't considered a bad thing if you succeeded. You <br/>
could call Sengoku the Age of Treachery without stretching it. If Akechi <br/>
had succeeded, it would have gone done as a great feat and the Edo <br/>
period would have been very different.<br/>

troops paraded around until out manuevered and then surrendered without <br/>
fighting. Those troops either cost money or are citizens after all. Of <br/>
course this rapidly ended when some bloody minded types showed up.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-828001763">I know that had Akechi Mitsuhide actually succeeded history would have remembered him differently. I used him only as an example.Takeda Shingen as another example, turned against his own father to take control of the Takeda clan, had he failed in this he would be thought of in the same way. As it turned out his gamble worked and today he is regarded in a much different way.You said "if you're a farmer, and you toil all day and sleep what little time you have off, what room is there for the "honor"". My response to this that there is lots of room left for "honor". Honor is more than just acts of loyalty or bravery, it is also the manner in which you conduct yourself. Where I come from deals are made with a handshake, and if I give my word, I keep my word. And when I am long gone nobody can say they got screwed by me. Is there not honor in this? Certainly all samurai didn't call out challenges, this practice was dependent upon the status of the man as well as the time period you are talking about. I am guilty of generalizations and for this I am sorry.<br/>

Please don't get me wrong, I am sure that there are a great deal of honourable people in modern Japan (perhaps more, perhaps less than elsewhere, who counts?) but I think what we see by and large is not 'honour' but 'face'. Recently the owner of a large Chicken company in Kyoto Prefecture and his wife committed suicide after the company had been found to have continued selling their produce despite a huge number of chicken deaths due to Chicken Influenza. He did not kill himself because of a dishonourable, dangerous business decision, but because he was found out by the authorities. This was no 'honourable' act of seppuku of death over surrender.<br/>
This tragic case is not alone. Reactionary bureaucratic corruption, a political and construction industry gravy train, marital infidelity, and widespread school bullying, to name a few other examples are rife (although obviously not just in Japan). A previous mailer correctly wrote that what is honourable is what is right (admittedly a subjective point of view, but there is always a certain lex naturae inherent in all societies), not just doing what is demanded of you (ie, obedience). Education in Japan, from Kindergarten to Uinversity is designed to cultivate a rigid hierarchical structure, where the uniformity of the 'ganbare' attitude creates soild, unsurprising employees, rather than aspiring individuals. Before anyone accuses me of Japan-bashing, I am not. I live in this society, am married into it, and now work within its education system. <br/>
The Chushingura epics, or other historical figures like Sugawara Michizane or Minamoto no Yoshitsune are exemplars to be looked upto in Japanese society, not models for life. <br/>

I hope that Kyle didn't upset you too much.  What you had said seemed <br/>
not only relevant but in line with what I have read and researched.  <br/>
You had a valid point.  Japan had a society built on a strong sense <br/>
of honor.  From the top to the bottom.  Although Samurai and Daimyos <br/>
were well known for manipulation, most of them believed in their <br/>
system of honor.  The film chushingura illustrates this very well.  <br/>
In fact, Japanese society is still built on honor.  Japan is a <br/>
conformist community.  You learn from a very young age that you must <br/>
fit into the norms of society.  If you do not, honor is lost/face is <br/>
lost.<br/>
  Suicide rates in Japan are amoung the highest in the world.   <br/>
That's not because teenage boys couldn't find a girlfriend.  <br/>
Students, businessmen, farmers, commit suicide because they cannot <br/>
bear the possibility that they bring shame upon their families.<br/>
For someone who cannot see the truth in your statement, such <br/>
blindness will prevent learning.  That's what this group is all <br/>
about.  Not making a snappy remark to make someone else look stupid.  <br/>
In this case, it was the snappy remark thet made Kyle look stupid.<br/>

The point that I was trying to make, and perhaps I was not wording it <br/>
in the right manner is that all the Japanese not just the samurai <br/>
class placed great importance on the reputation of themselves and <br/>
their familys. Akechi Mitsuhide is regarded badly for his act against <br/>
Nobunaga, his name is tarnished forever as well as the name of his <br/>
family. The same would hold true if you were a peasant and your <br/>
father were a criminal, you would be thought of as coming from a bad <br/>
family. As far as calling out challenges and proclaiming your <br/>
pedigree and the deeds of your ancestors, every text I have has <br/>
dozens of acounts. I ain't no kid, I have read about this subject for <br/>
many years and I will talk if I want to.. If you dissagree with me <br/>
fine but a little manners on your part would be nice.<br/>

DATE MASAMUNE: THE ONE-EYED DRAGON <br/>
Dokuganryu no Yabo Date Masamune - 1993 - Color - Fullscreen - Extras - 2 Discs <br/>
<br/>
Young Masamune upon learning of the death of Nobunaga decides that he is the man to <br/>
fill those sainted clogs. The fastest way to do this is to subjugate the neighboring <br/>
warlords. This is an action that results in the death of his father and younger brother and <br/>
not the least brings him to the attention of Hideyoshi and not in a good way either but <br/>
intervention by the regents nephew Hidetsugu and Maeda Toshiie save his neck <br/>
although he is forced to move to a smaller fief and send his wife to Kyoto as hostage. <br/>
Although curbed of his lofty ambitions his friendship with Hidetsugu again lands him in <br/>
hot water when Ishida Mitsunari arranges the downfall of the 'Unfortunate Hidetsugu', <br/>
Toshiie and Ieyasu save his neck and the flamboyant young warlord is sent to Korea <br/>
where he wins great honors. Upon his return Hideyoshi is dead and Masamune allies <br/>
himself with Tokugawa Ieyasu thus assuring the survival of the Date family. An amazing <br/>
story from beginning to the end! <br/>
<br/>
Directed by: MASUDA Toshio / NISHIGAKI Yoshiharu <br/>
Cast: TAKAHASHI Hideki, NATSUYAGI Isao, TSUGAWA Masahiko, AKIYOSHI Kumiko, <br/>
KITAOJI Kinya, ISHIBASHI Renji, TAMURA Ryo, WAKABAYASHI Go <br/>
