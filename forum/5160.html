I recommend two online resources for this kind of research.<br/>
<br/>
1. Our kind host has a very good set of maps at <br/>
www.sengoku-archives.com For instance there is this one that shows the <br/>
names of the Daimyo (but not the names of the "kuni") in 1545:<br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.samurai-archives.com/1545.html">http://www.samurai-archives.com/1545.html</a><br/>
2. There is a great map that shows the outlines of the kuni and <br/>
their old names at <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://flagspot.net/flags/jp(">http://flagspot.net/flags/jp(</a>k.html<br/>
3. If I new anything about mapping software I would make for myself <br/>
a map which combines the two, plus included modern prefecture <br/>
boundaries and names. It's been on my mind for about a year now but <br/>
it's one of those projects that I guess I'll get to "one of these <br/>
days" (like my translation of the ShinChou KouKi....)<br/>
<br/>
But, recognize that even though the Sengoku period was rather short, <br/>
it was quite turbulent. So, the answers to your questions are all <br/>
pretty much "it depends on exactly what date you are looking at". <br/>
Are you interested in a specific time period/date, or the overall <br/>
flow of events during the entire late 15th-16th centuries?<br/>

 </span></blockquote>So you're looking for the Daimyo active in Mutsu and<br/>
Dewa during the Sengoku? Try looking up the Date,<br/>
Mogami, Ashina, and Nambu clans. All were active in<br/>
the area, the Date being the most dominant. <br/>
