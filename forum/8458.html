<h3>The New Guy</h3>
by <i>tribarhelmet</i>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-183350945">Greetings everyone!<br/>
   <br/>
  I just wanted to briefly introduce myself.  My name is Ty, and I have had an interest in Japan, particularly the samurai since I was a child.  I have been interested not only in the history, warfare, social structure, and food.<br/>
   <br/>
  I will not pretend to be an expert-rather I am hoping to learn from the group and eventually be able to contribute useful information and resources.  I read your rules and the misconceptions list and agree to follow them.  <br/>
   <br/>
  So much for my dreams of being a modern samurai and forcing cowardly ninjas to commit hari-kiri with a butter knife.<br/>
   <br/>
  Thanks for reading,<br/>
   <br/>
  Ty<br/>
<br/>

Don't lose any sleep over it, we're just one big dysfunctional <br/>
family. It's a blast to watch <g>.<br/>
