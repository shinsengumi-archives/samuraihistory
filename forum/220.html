<h3>Hello</h3>

<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-256764458">recently i am trying to translate some famous samurai episode in to <br/>
english as one of Japanese sengoku freak.<br/>
<br/>
 If it will be helpful not only what samurai did in sengoku era but <br/>
also to understand samurai's way of thinking and what are influenced <br/>
to current japanese society by them.<br/>
<br/>
 I am gald to continue doing that.<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 Here is one story that I translated recently.<br/>
 <br/>
m科盛信@と　高�"¬"ﾞ岸桜<br/>
<br/>
In 1582, in order to destroy house of Takeda, Oda Nobunaga <br/>
dispatched to Takato castle <br/>
<br/>
about 50,000 soldiers to fall it and surrounded around castle of <br/>
Takato.<br/>
<br/>
Castle lord at that time was Nishina Morinobu who was fifth son of <br/>
Takeda Shingen.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
He refused advice of surrender by Oda army and held only with 3,000 <br/>
soldiers in castle.<br/>
<br/>
After all-out battle, all of soldiers in castle perished and castle <br/>
fallen down. <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
There are about 1500 "kohigan" cherry trees that were planted from <br/>
the Meiji period.<br/>
<br/>
Takato Kohigan cherry trees are as known one of three famous place <br/>
of cherry trees in <br/>
<br/>
Japan.<br/>
<br/>
People said because cherry trees absorbed and drunk a lot of blood <br/>
of samurai who <br/>
<br/>
perished in Takato castle battle, gKohigan cherry become such a one <br/>
of very beautiful <br/>
<br/>
sakura.<br/>
