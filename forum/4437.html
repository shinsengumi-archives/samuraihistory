 </span></blockquote>If you mean the early "elites, " we don't really know. They were <br/>
-PERHAPS- Koreans. But that's only one of the theories.<br/>
If you mean the Imperial dynasty, well, theoretically there is only ONE <br/>
dynasty. The... Imperial dynasty. They have no name.<br/>

<h3>Re: the  first  dynasties</h3>
by <i>zevlord</i>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-563324548">Ok, well the first true dynasty of Japan was the Tokugawa dynasty or <br/>
shogun (King). The reason why I say the true dynasty is because the <br/>
Tokugawa clan was the first to unite the whole of Japan. Before this <br/>
there was may warlords ruling different provinces. Another thing to <br/>
bear in mind is that when the Tokugawa shogun united Japan a new era <br/>
in Japan began (edo period). Below is a list of the different periods <br/>
in Japanese history:<br/>
<br/>
JOMON (10,000 - 300 B.C.) Prehistoric period of tribal/clan <br/>
organization.<br/>
<br/>
YAYOI (300 B.C. - A.D. 300) Rice cultivation, metalworking, and the <br/>
potter's wheel are introduced from China and Korea. Era named "Yayoi" <br/>
after the place in Tokyo where wheel-turned pottery was found.<br/>
<br/>
KOFUN (YAMATO) (300 - 645) Unified state begins with emergence of <br/>
powerful clan rulers; Japan establishes close contacts with mainland <br/>
Asia.<br/>
<br/>
ASUKA (645 -710) A great wave of reforms called the Taika no Kaishin <br/>
(Taika Reforms) aims to strengthen the emperor's power. <br/>
<br/>
NARA (710 - 794) Imperial court builds new capital, modeled upon <br/>
Chang-an in China, at Nara. Though emperors are Shinto chiefs, they <br/>
patronize Buddhism in the belief that its teachings will bring about <br/>
a peaceful society and protect the state.<br/>
<br/>
HEIAN (794-1185) Imperial court moves to Heiankyo (now Kyoto) to <br/>
escape domination of Nara's Buddhist establishment. Official contacts <br/>
with China stop in 838.<br/>
<br/>
KAMAKURA (185-1333) Military government established in Kamakura by <br/>
Minamoto no Yoritomo. Emperor, as figurehead, remains in Kyoto with <br/>
the court aristocracy.<br/>
MUROMACHI (1333 -1568) Muromachi district of Kyoto becomes base for <br/>
Shogun Ashikaga Takauji's new military government. <br/>
<br/>
1467-1568: The 10 year-long Onin no Ran (Onin War) <br/>
AZUCHIMOMOYA MA (1568 -1600) Oda Nobunaga starts process of <br/>
reunifying Japan after a century of civil war; he is followed by <br/>
Toyotomi <br/>
Hideyoshi (1536-1598). Foundation of modern Japan is laid.<br/>
EDO (TOKUGAWA) (1600 -1868) Japan enters an age of peace and national <br/>
isolation.<br/>
<br/>
MEIJI (1868 -1912) The emperor is restored; Japan makes transition to <br/>
nation-state.<br/>
<br/>
TAISHO [1912-1926] Japan expands economic base within Asia and the <br/>
Pacific.<br/>
<br/>
SHOWA [1926 -1989] Japan experiences World War II and its aftermath, <br/>
as well as economic recovery.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
And here is a list of the most prominent clans:<br/>
<br/>
Akechi<br/>
Amako<br/>
(1400-1610)<br/>
Gamou<br/>
Go-Hôjô<br/>
Hosokawa<br/>
Imagawa<br/>
Maeda<br/>
Mori<br/>
(1148-1625) <br/>
Nagao<br/>
Sanada<br/>
(1500-1650)<br/>
Shimazu<br/>
(1280-1640)<br/>
Takeda<br/>
(1493-1582)<br/>
Tokugawa<br/>
Ukita<br/>
<br/>
Hope this is helps</div>

 </span></blockquote>I disagree with this answer. Or maybe it's better for me to say that <br/>
this is a very simplistic answer to a question that has not really bee<br/>
n clarified yet. I don't think that anyone can answer the question unt<br/>
il we understand what the original poster means by "early dynasties".<br/>
<br/>
I hope that the original poster does not take this essay and start <br/>
using it as the basis for tutoring other people about Japanese <br/>
history.<br/>
<br/>
I don't think there is any way to say that the Tokugawa were the first <br/>
"true" dynasty.<br/>
<br/>
And, shogun does not mean "King".<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> >Before this <br/>
>there was may warlords ruling different provinces. <br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Why does this fact mean that anything before Tokugawa does not <br/>
qualify as a dynasty? In fact if you look at each of the "provinces" <br/>
themselves, the ruling families in each of them tended to be <br/>
dynasties - in the sense that the ruling family tended to hold control <br/>
across generations. Further those same warlord families continued to <br/>
rule the provinces even during the Tokugawa era.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> >Another thing to <br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>The naming of eras does not provide a measuring stick for what is <br/>
and what is not a dynasty. Even if it did, your own list shows two <br/>
other eras, Kamakura and Muromachi, that had their own name and that <br/>
were ruled by different shogun families.<br/>
<br/>
This timeline is handy as a quick reference point. But of course it <br/>
oversimplifies and makes too many assumptions to be used as a basis <br/>
for . Did you get it from this site?<br/>

I'm preparing my degree thesis and (obviously would say my friends) I choosed to do a research about Bakumatsu.<br/>
Now, I'm writing to you for a specific thing and I am sure this is the only place where I could find an help! In a manga (Rurouni Kenshin to be exact) translated in italian, unfortunately, I found a poem; I don't know if it is a haiku or it belongs to other style of poetry or if it  isa novel as well, but it is about the arrive of the Black Ship, about the Commodore Perry.<br/>
I would like to know if someone knows it or tell me where I could find the japanese version.<br/>
I translated it into english, but I don't know how much it is similar to the original. I don't know if this could help anyway.<br/>

(word by word). Of course you need to trust your translation, but <br/>
perhaps... good luck.<br/>
By the way, where are you studying?<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Bakumatsu is definitely not my territory, but the poem is famous. It's <br/>
not exactly how it has been passed onto you in Italian. The <br/>
poem goes:<br/>
<br/>
&#27888;&#24179;&#12398;&#30496;&#12426;&#12434;&#35226;&#12414;&#12377;&#19978;&#21916;&#25776;<br/>
&#12383;&#12387;&#12383;&#65300;&#26479;&#12391;&#22812;&#12418;&#30496;&#12428;&#12378;<br/>
<br/>
It is a style called "狂歌", kyouka.<br/>
<br/>
Like most kyouka it's very hard to translate because it involves <br/>
puns. But it says:<br/>
<br/>
"Joukisen - wakes them up from their peaceful sleep<br/>
With just four cups they cannot sleep at night".<br/>
<br/>
All kinds of action in here. :) This "peaceful" 泰平 sleep is a pun <br/>
for "Pacific" 太平 sleep - in other words not paying attention to what <br/>
is going on across the ocean. That is probably the meaning of the <br/>
pun that the Japanese-Italian translator chose to use in his <br/>
translation.<br/>
<br/>
Joukisen is a kind of tea. So the apparent meaning of the poem is <br/>
that the person who drinks 4 cups of tea is not able to sleep at <br/>
night.<br/>
<br/>
The trick is that "joukisen" &#19978;&#21916;&#25776; also is the pronunciation of the <br/>
word "steamship" &#33976;&#27671;&#33337;&#12288;and 4 "cups" is interpreted as "4 ships".<br/>
<br/>
So the hidden meaning is "4 steam ships wake them up from their <br/>
Pacific sleep. Now they cannot sleep at night".<br/>
<br/>
Of course as you know of the 4 ships only 2 of them were steamships <br/>
- but that's just a minor detail. :)<br/>

<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1831185477">I don't know what it says. I only speak French and japanese (and of course English). Here is a really good essay you would like:<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
ONE DAY THE SUN WILL RISE<br/>
Many have screamed the truth to the heavens, many will continue to do so to the wind; but few ears are really willing to listen. Can it be that our human nature prevents us from "hearing" what our masters are telling us? Can it be that humanity is asleep, choked with false values, idols or ideals? Why do most people roam searching, consciously or unconsciously, for something or someone to follow? Are we facing our own drowsiness when we search to be identified, noticed and become a part of something?<br/>
<br/>
Many people have asked themselves: Who am I? Where am I going? Why am I here in this world? Questions that surely have troubled us, but the real problem is not the question, rather the answer. How many of us have found it? Sadder still, how many of us haven't found it? Even sadder still, how many of us, once we've made the question haven't even taken the time to think about it? It seems easier to follow the "normal" course of things, be born, live and die without knowing why and what for.<br/>
<br/>
Have we ever stopped in our lives to "see" and "listen"? Have we stopped the world and analysed if we are on the right road? And do we even know any other road different from egoism, vanity, violence and consumism?<br/>
<br/>
Many will stick to the different forms of religion and creeds while searching for something more human; others will follow different forms of cultural, bodily and spiritual expressions and in this search (if it exists) how will we know if we are on the right track? Let us listen to our inner being, listen and interpret our internal signals and intuition.<br/>
<br/>
If you are reading these reflexions, you are related to Karate in some way, if so, have you ever stopped to think if you are really practicing Karate? Before continuing, ask yourself: what do I understand by Karate? Most probably, and I understand you, it may be exactly the contrary of what it really is. Mass media have created the general concept people have of Karate, violence, egoism, individualism and vanity are concepts that are manipulated, inbuilt and hightened to "sell" it in our society.<br/>
<br/>
We are used to competing in every aspect of our lives, then why not compete in Karate? Is this what our Masters, the founders of the art, wanted for us, for the human society? What would Master Funakoshi and Master Egami think about the evolution the Martial Art has taken? Do you really think the attributes I just mentioned were the goals of karate evolution the masters defined?<br/>
<br/>
If you practice competition (and I will not call it Karate), I invite you to strongly reflect on these words, because the real "DO" is not a road to violence, actually its the exact contrary, it's the road to love. Yes, Karate-do is the road of love (way of love), the art transformed into love, the road of personal development based on love, love of yourself, love of your training partner, love of your Dojo, love of your environment, love of nature, love of teaching, love of spirituality. Love, respect, loyalty, partnership, detachment are a few of the concepts our masters have tried to give us through their "art" called KARATE. If we accept that Karate is love, spirituality, a connection with the Universe, with the vital energy, with Ki; what then is competition? I will leave the question open, but once again I ask: What sense is there in winning over another person? Is there any pleasure in hurting a training partner? What do I want to prove by breaking a rib? Is it so important to<br/>
 feel you are a "winner", but winner of what? Is it justifiable to hurt or harm someone else to have a medal hanging on the wall? Because you were the best... best in what? of what? for what? I leave the questions open and each one must deeply reflect and find his/her own answers, answers based on the personal study within this beautiful art called Karate, that never was, and never will be, a method to harm others, nor a method to heighten or feed egos, negative feelings or vanities.<br/>
<br/>
Let's not waste our time, let's wake up and jump right in the adventure of personal development, the search of the real I. And how far will we go? It all depends on how deep we are willing to go. <br/>
<br/>
Later,<br/>
<br/>
Sam <br/>

 </span></blockquote>Sorry to correct you again, but shogun does *not* mean<br/>
warlord, or governor of a province. It's short for<br/>
"sei-i tai shogun", and means, loosely translated,<br/>
"barbarian subduing general in chief" or some<br/>
approximation. It was the title granted to the<br/>
military dictator of the country, not a province, by<br/>
the Emperor, ostensibly to rule in the Emperor's name.<br/>
Three families held the title--first the Minamoto,<br/>
then the Ashikaga (related to the Minamoto), then the<br/>
Tokugawa (supposedly related, though it's been<br/>
questioned). Most sources will tell you that direct<br/>
relation to the Minamoto family was required to be<br/>
granted the title, but that's also been questioned. <br/>
<br/>
"Shogun" by itself basically means "general", or<br/>
"field marshal". "Taisho" is much more common for<br/>
general, though. <br/>
<br/>
"Daimyo", literally meaning "big name", is the word<br/>
you are thinking of when you think "warlord"--that's<br/>
about the most direct translation. However, it didn't<br/>
necessarily have a provincial designation. You could<br/>
be "daimyo" of a province, you could be "daimyo" of<br/>
many provinces, or of part of a province. Governor is<br/>
often the translation for the title "kami", and in the<br/>
Heian period did mean actual appointment as a<br/>
governor, for the most part. In the 1500's, it was<br/>
largely a name only title--you could be "Bingo no<br/>
kami" (Governor of Bingo) without ever having set foot<br/>
in the province of Bingo, and having nothing to do<br/>
with the administration of it. <br/>
<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Interestingly the title Sei-i-tai-Shogun actually goes back even <br/>
further than the Minamoto. For a while in the Heian period, it was the <br/>
title - or rather a sort of temporary title - of people who were <br/>
literally assigned to quell the northeastern part of Japan. It was not <br/>
a life-long position and it was granted and rescinded a few times <br/>
before the Kamakura "shogunate" as we think of it today.<br/>
<br/>
The first was TaJiHi-no-AgataMori in 720. The most famous of these <br/>
early shogun was probably Saka-no-ue no Tamura Maro in 797.<br/>
<br/>
There were other, similar military "assignments" that came with <br/>
temporary titles during this Heian period.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> >questioned). Most sources will tell you that direct<br/>
>relation to the Minamoto family was required to be<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Personally I don't believe that there was a specific "rule" that the <br/>
shogun had to be from the Minamoto line, or Genji. It was more like <br/>
an accepted practice. I talk a little about the relationship between <br/>
the Minamoto and the Taira families at the "Family Tree" section of my <br/>
website. <br/>
<br/>
<snip very good stuff><br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> >many provinces, or of part of a province. Governor is<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>To take this a little further: These titles were relics from the <br/>
ritsuryo system which had died out several hundreds of years <br/>
earlier. One of my pet projects right now is to study the ritsuryo <br/>
system and to follow that through the centuries to try and figure <br/>
out why these titles remained so important that they were kept for <br/>
so long, without any connection to reality.<br/>
<br/>
Finally as you might already know, Bingo-no-kami was actually one of <br/>
the titles of Nobunaga's father, Nobuhide. :)<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Yeah, I know, but I was going with the "simple answer<br/>
is better" theory for the moment. To explain it in its<br/>
entirety in order to disavow the notion that it was a<br/>
provincial lord seemed like it might be a bit much. <br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> > Personally I don't believe that there was a specific<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Agree--especially since there is evidence in letters<br/>
that some court nobles extended an offer to Nobunaga<br/>
to secure the position for him. Being as he claimed<br/>
Taira descent and not Minamoto, that would seem to put<br/>
the nix on that.<br/>
<br/>

 </span></blockquote>It's only on one platform, the computer. The<br/>

Paleolithic? Neolithic? Jomon? Yayoi? Nara/Heian....??<br/>
Please be more specific!!<br/>

I mean about  202  A. D. !  I  understand  there  were  four  dynasties, and  I want  to know  the  major  achievement  they  had  as  dynasties  and  how  they  modified,  If  they  did  so, the  social  customs.!<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-622117280">The Chinese records of the third century CE, such as those of the Wei Dynasty, use names for the various groupings that their envoys were in contact with, although these names, and their groups, are particularly difficult to place geographically. The Wei envoys whom visited Japan did so between 220 and 265, with envoys from 'Japan' heading to present-day Korea between 238 and 247. The Wei records list thirty "countries" on the Japanese archipelago, primarily in central Honshu and Kyushu, although "dynasties" may be a term unsuited to these largely tribal confederations of the latter Yayoi period, rather than the later, progressively centralised nation-state under the leading tribe (or "country" from the Chinese records), the Yamato.  <br/>

 </span></blockquote>Hi, I'm new to this group (although some of you might know me from <br/>
the Samurai Archives message board.<br/>
<br/>
I don't know if I've understood the question fully, but if we're talking <br/>
about ancient Japan, 202AD would be roughly during the time of the <br/>
Empress Jingo's (Jingo Kogo) regency, or around 200 years before the <br/>
start of the Yamato period. She supposedly invaded Korea around <br/>
200AD (I have no idea if this date is myth or reality), although I've also <br/>
seen 366AD cited as a date for her invasion of Silla, and 200AD cited as <br/>
the date around which Himiko/Pimiko ruled. I have absolutely no idea <br/>
which of these two sets of dates is correct though.<br/>

You're getting lots of replies but it's still very hard for me to <br/>
understand exactly what you mean.<br/>
<br/>
Can you please tell us what you mean by the word "dynasty"? Also, <br/>
where did you come to the understanding that there were four of <br/>
these "dynasties" in Japan in 202AD?<br/>
<br/>
I think if we can get a little bit more perspective from your side, <br/>
we can all help with exactly the kind of information you are <br/>
looking for.<br/>

it has a specific number of syllables. That is true for kyou-ka as <br/>

have the misohito-moji &#19977;&#21313;&#19968;&#25991;&#23383; structure (57577)<br/>
