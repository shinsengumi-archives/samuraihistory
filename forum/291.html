<h3>Samurai Archives Site</h3>
by <i>Christopher West</i>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-214709791">Due to inexplicable events beyond comprehension, all traces of the <br/>
Samurai Archives Japanese History Page have been erased from <br/>
the 'Free' server it was stored on - apparently by the company that <br/>
runs the server itself - possibly a crash or some other unfortunate <br/>
event. . . Fortunately copies of all of the HTML pages are safe, <br/>
however only 70% or so of the images were saved . . . It may be a <br/>
while before we can find space and upload to another free server <br/>
somewhere else, however if anyone has any info on a good free server <br/>
with over 50MB of space, feel free to email off list: <br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="mailto:kitsuno@...">kitsuno@...</a><br/>
Anyone who wants to look at the smoking remains feel free:<br/>
