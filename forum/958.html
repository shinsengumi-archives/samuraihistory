<div id="ygrps-yiv-1665884031">Greetings, I liked the book very very much, I have read it many times. It is about one of the most famous swordsmen of all time in Japan. Miyamoto Musashi, the inventor of the Nitenryu sword style which used both katana and wakizashi as weapons, which, as you can guess, was very controversial. It is a historical fiction and tells a good story. I recommend it to anyone interested in Japanese samurai and history.<br/>
<br/>
    As a side question, how many of you have read the Book of Five Rings by Miyamoto Musashi? I am just interested to know.<br/>
<br/>
Compassion go with you,<br/>
