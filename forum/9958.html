<div id="ygrps-yiv-746512514">Hey everyone,<br/>
   I finally got to see the shogun edition of warriors on Discovery last night, and I thought it was pretty good. As historically inaccurate as the ninja scene was (correct me if I'm wrong), I thought that it was even pretty good. What are your all's thoughts on it?<br/>
