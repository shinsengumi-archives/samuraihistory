OLD MILL TOWN<br/>
Investigating the history of Hiroo<br/>
<br/>
By SUMIKO ENBUTSU<br/>
<br/>
The Shibuya River starts at Shinjuku Gyoen. Running southward, it <br/>
makes a big horseshoe curve near Ebisu and heads north to Roppongi. <br/>
At Ichi-no-hashi, it abruptly bends east to eventually pour into <br/>
Tokyo Bay. The river's upper reaches are now culverts, but water <br/>
emerges just south of Shibuya Station in a concrete conduit. In its <br/>
lower reaches the river (mentioned in this column Oct. 7, 2005) has <br/>
a different name -- Furukawa.<br/>
<br/>
Along the middle reaches -- in the Harajuku, Shibuya and Hiroo <br/>
areas -- the waters used to be abundant and were used to run mills, <br/>
a crucial source of power in preindustrialized Japan. In this region <br/>
on the border between Edo City to the east and farming villages to <br/>
the west, mills were important for grinding grain into flour or in <br/>
removing the hulls of harvested rice. As just about everyone ate <br/>
steamed rice as their staple food three times a day, preparing kome <br/>
for the daily dinner table was a profitable business. <br/>
<br/>
The accompanying woodcut print, titled "Hiroo Mizuguruma (The Hiroo <br/>
Mill)," depicts the largest mill along the Shibuya River. As the <br/>
mill house is half hidden behind trees, the viewer might be <br/>
attracted first by a lively bunch of people just about to walk over <br/>
a bridge. Carrying fruit and bottles tied to a pole are two men, one <br/>
of whom is looking back and finishing off a joke, with the others <br/>
bursting into laughter. The clumps of susuki grass growing near the <br/>
bridge suggest the season is autumn.<br/>
<br/>
A short distance upstream on the left is a dam. The water is guided <br/>
between white-walled buildings to reach the mill -- which has a <br/>
thatched roof -- and hits the wheel at its bottom. Afterward, the <br/>
water returns to the river via a drain.<br/>
<br/>
Installed in a corner of a spacious garden facing the handsome tile-<br/>
roofed building, the 7-meter-in-diameter mill turned out hefty <br/>
profits for its owner, Tamagawa Kinzaburo, who had 10 employees to <br/>
tend to the almost 100 pounding pestles that were linked to the <br/>
powerful wheel.<br/>
As of 1888, 34 mills existed along the Shibuya River, and they were <br/>
later applied to new uses, such as cotton-spinning, but all <br/>
disappeared by the turn of the 20th century when electricity was <br/>
perceived as a more efficient power source. The depicted bridge, <br/>
called Yamashita-bashi, still exists, but it fails to remind you of <br/>
things past.<br/>
<br/>
When you start your walk, go from JR Ebisu Station's north exit (or <br/>
Hibiya Line Ebisu Station, Exit 1 or 2). Go under the elevated rail <br/>
tracks by the station. Turn right at the second stoplight and follow <br/>
Meiji-dori till the road veers to the right. Pause to look for a <br/>
small playground off to your right and then turn right just before <br/>
the stoplight there to find Yamashita-bashi, now in drab concrete. <br/>
From the bridge's other side, the wooded park is vaguely reminiscent <br/>
of Tamagawa's garden without the mill.<br/>
<br/>
Back at the stoplight, cross Meiji-dori, bear left to cross another <br/>
street and turn left. At the next stoplight, go right, passing by <br/>
Rinsen Elementary School, the third oldest public school in Shibuya-<br/>
ku, founded in 1879 by local volunteers. <br/>
<br/>
In the wake of the 1868 Meiji Restoration, enthusiasm ran high among <br/>
citizens for the introduction of modern school systems. The decree <br/>
of universal education had been issued in 1872, but with its <br/>
implementation being delayed owing to budgetary and other reasons, <br/>
concerned citizens took the initiative for school construction in <br/>
their respective locales once issued with a license from the mayor <br/>
of Tokyo. The first elementary school in Shibuya-ku was built in <br/>
1875 near the present Shibuya Station with funds raised extensively <br/>
by local leaders, including Hachiroemon Mitsui, the head of the <br/>
Mitsui financial and industrial conglomerate. Mitsui paid for the <br/>
personnel and maintenance expenses, too, with funds from a mill <br/>
house he had at what is now Tokyu Department Store until the <br/>
municipal budget became ready several years later.<br/>
<br/>
Tamagawa Kinzaburo's own involvement in Rinsen Elementary School is <br/>
not known; though, he is likely to have supported the school in his <br/>
village as well.<br/>
<br/>
The construction site was farmland owned by the nearby Shoun-ji <br/>
Temple. The temple donated half of the 305 tsubo (about 1,000 sq. <br/>
meters) of land and leased the other half. Much expanded since then, <br/>
the school continues to stand at its birthplace.<br/>
<br/>
Shoun-ji, too, remains in thick woods on your right. To reach its <br/>
front gate, turn right at the T ahead and follow the road hugging <br/>
the stone-buttressed edges of condominium compounds and the Sacred <br/>
Heart University campus. At the crossing with a shopping street, <br/>
turn right to pass through a roofed wooden gate and then left to <br/>
find Shoun-ji at the end of the lane. <br/>
<br/>
The unassuming temple is a quiet center of Zen Buddhism. It was <br/>
patronized by prominent daimyo lords in Edo. It was founded by Lord <br/>
Kuroda Tadayuki, daimyo of the Fukuoka domain, in honor of his <br/>
father, Kuroda Nagamasa (1568-1623), who had contributed greatly to <br/>
Japan's unification under Shogun Tokugawa Ieyasu. Tadayuki <br/>
designated Shoun-ji as the burial place for the Kuroda family, and <br/>
the Kuroda's branch families followed suit. As a result, an amazing <br/>
village of quaint tombstones make up the cemetery to this day. <br/>
Nagamasa's tomb is a plain stone slab, housed in a fenced-in shed at <br/>
the far end of the cemetery. <br/>
<br/>
Leaving the temple grounds via the roofed gate, walk straight to <br/>
reach Hiroo Station on the Hibiya Line. Nearby is Kato Gallery & <br/>
Framer, which is famous for contemporary prints and paintings. Time <br/>
permitting, extend your steps to visit the lovely Arisugawa-no-miya <br/>
Memorial Park, originally a daimyo's suburban residence. Backtrack <br/>
to Hiroo Station to return.<br/>
