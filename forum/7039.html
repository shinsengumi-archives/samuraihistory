Please accept this invitation to come and see our exhibition. The exhibition <br/>
dates are the 21st and 22nd of May, 2005. The exhibition is only for two <br/>
days. If you want to come and see our work and deepen your<br/>
understanding of the Japanese sword and speak to us.<br/>
<br/>
The swordsmiths, Kubo Yoshihiro, Matsuba Kunimasa, Yamamoto Tadashi and <br/>
myself<br/>
