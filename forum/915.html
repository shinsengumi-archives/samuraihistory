<div id="ygrps-yiv-693021573">Hi,<br/>
<br/>
Can anyone tell me if the Ashigaru wore or not Sashimono in battle? <br/>
Was there a specific number of Sashimono per unit? What Ashigaru <br/>
units were more likely to wear them? <br/>
<br/>
Thanks,<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Some Ashigaru were supplied with Sashimono by their Daimyo. Some <br/>
Daimyo did not. Uniformed ashigaru seemed to be used during the main <br/>
period of Sengoku about 1570-1600. My dates might be a bit off but it <br/>
seems to me to coincide with the rise of professional ashigaru during <br/>
the later years. Each ashigaru would have one if so organized.<br/>
<br/>
BTW is your real name Nuno Pereira??? I ask because I am Portuguese <br/>
and that name rings a bell regarding a general by I believe the same <br/>
name during the wars vs Castille in the late 14 th century.</div>
