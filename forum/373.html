<h3>The hakama - from an iaidoka perspective:</h3>
by <i>thomas5403</i>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-657343402">Hi all -<br/>
<br/>
As a fair proportion of iai technique is performed from a <br/>
seated posture, I thought it might be useful to post a couple <br/>
of points.<br/>
<br/>
The beginner learns initially in seiza - the kneeling posture <br/>
used indoors and formally. At the commencement of any technique <br/>
the practitioner is therefore seated, with his weight on his <br/>
ankles, the feet flat and soles facing upward, and his first <br/>
move is to rise up to allow him to turn his toes to get a grip <br/>
to launch an attack.<br/>
<br/>
The most common seated posture, however, is tate hiza, sitting <br/>
with one knee raised, the foot close in to the body, the other <br/>
leg folded beneath you, bum on ankle. It is an uncomfortable <br/>
posture but it allows maximum of movement, freedom of movement <br/>
to pivot in any direction, and therefore gives the man seated <br/>
in hiza a marked advantage over someone in seiza.<br/>
<br/>
Tate hiza came about because it is the easiest way to sit when <br/>
wearing armour, other than on a stool. One cannot sit in seiza, <br/>
which compacts the torso, without the body of the armour rising <br/>
up around the neck.<br/>
<br/>
Another posture is iai-goshi, which is used widely in aikido, <br/>
and was a combative form of hiza (probably hiza derives from <br/>
it). In this both heels are raised and the toes on the ground, <br/>
effectively its a squat with one knee down. It allows greater <br/>
freedom of movement still, whilst keeping a low profile, and I <br/>
have seen aikido practitioners move with amazing speed and <br/>
change of direction in iai-goshi, 'running rings' round those <br/>
on two feet.<br/>
<br/>
In iai circles hiza and goshi are 'combative' postures and can <br/>
be read to imply uncertainty and mistrust in semi formal <br/>
situations. A samurai sitting in hiza before his lord, if his <br/>
katana was within reach, would be watched intently by the <br/>
master's guards. Samurai countered this by stating that such a <br/>
posture showed 'zanshin' - the state of constant alertness (a <br/>
simplified definition) and a readiness to perform his master's <br/>
will.<br/>
<br/>
Put another way, if I was receiving an armed warrior, sitting <br/>
in seiza, and he in hiza, I would probably change my posture <br/>
accordingly.<br/>
<br/>
Trivia:<br/>
<br/>
It is bad manners to show the soles of one's feet when sitting. <br/>
The cross-legged posture of the west is used in the east but <br/>
the feet are kept tucked in to the body and the hakama is drawn <br/>
in close to cover the soles without 'spraying' all over the <br/>
floor, which is dillatory and considered somewhat flashy or <br/>
feminine.<br/>
<br/>
The practice of overlong sleeves and leggings in court attire <br/>
was adopted from the Chinese court dress and had a useful <br/>
benefit of hampering an attacker. The draw of the Katori Shinto <br/>
Ryu utilises a 'roll' of the wrist as the right hand reaches <br/>
across to the hilt, and this serves to roll the sleeve back <br/>
from the wrist and thus not hamper the draw of the sword.<br/>
<br/>
Samurai in 'civvies' would tuck the cuffs of their hakama in <br/>
the waistband and tie back their sleeves (if time and <br/>
circumstance allowed).<br/>
<br/>
Iai techniques when all protagonists begin in kneeling postures <br/>
sometimes employ the device of stamping on the opponent's <br/>
hakama cuff to imobilise him prior to a strike. Others involves <br/>
forcing your opponent down with your sword then stamping on his <br/>
sleeve or whatever to hold him there.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1494996848">Hello,<br/>
<br/>
All of this is great and correct.  The seated position<br/>
for wearing armor is also used in some aiki-jutsu<br/>
schools.  It is great to hear some logical and correct<br/>
Martial combat ideas.<br/>

<h3>Re: [samuraihistory] Does anyone here do Kendo?</h3>

<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-231434566">Hello.<br/>
 I used to study Kendo in Chalk Farm, London for a while but found it very <br/>
difficult to 'warm to'.<br/>
 I do believe that Kendo serves an excellant purpose as a 'taster' for many <br/>
of the wide world of Japanese Bujutsu in general and it is an excellent <br/>
pursuit in itself.<br/>
 I have since moved on to study Kenjutsu proper..My Bugei (martial <br/>
organisation) is the Genbukan Ninpo Bugei and the Kokusai Jujutsu Renmei <br/>
which teach a variety of Kenjutsu waza from more than one old Japanese Ryu-ha <br/>
including Hontai Kukishin Ryu, Hontai Takagi Yoshin Ryu, Itto Ryu, and <br/>
Asayama Ichiden Ryu techniques.<br/>
 I personally love the Kukishin ryu Bikenjutsu (or 'hidden sword techniques') <br/>
which are incredibly flowing and amazing to watch. Iai is also taught and I <br/>
love that almost as much as the Kenjutsu!<br/>
 Good luck with your training..It truly is a path for life!<br/>

<h3>Kenjutsu in London?</h3>
by <i>thomas5403</i>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-235081532">Hi Ben - <br/>
<br/>
Do you study kenjutsu in London?<br/>
<br/>
I used to study Muso Shinden Ryu iaido at the Hagakure Dojo in<br/>
Kennington.<br/>
<br/>
Iaido, Jodo, Kenjutsu and Tanjo primarily, with the sensei 'slipping<br/>
in' bits n pieces when we could extract it from them.<br/>
<br/>
A favourite story:<br/>
There is a technique called sanpo giri - 3 direction cut.<br/>
<br/>
You are approached by three men, who begin to separate to give<br/>
themselves room to attack you from 3 directions (front, left and<br/>
right).<br/>
<br/>
You dummy at the front guy to stall him, but turn to cut down the man<br/>
on your right - do an immediate 180 turn to take the man in your rear <br/>
(which was your left) who was moving in to take you from behind, <br/>
then turn to the front and cut down the third man.<br/>
<br/>
We were being instructed by a visiting Japanese sensei, who said,<br/>
"when my great great grandfather do this one, last man throw down <br/>
sword and run away!"<br/>
<br/>
Whether he was kidding or not, we never knew, but it was a sobering<br/>
reminder about just what it was we were doing, and about men who <br/>
lived and died by how seriously they took their training!<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-95922361">Hi Lee - <br/>
<br/>
Where are you based? The style you want is Niten Ichi Ryu. I 'think'<br/>
there's a school in the UK but I'm not sure, and various techniques <br/>
have been incorporated into other styles - I used to do two sword <br/>
kenjutsu techniques as part of the Muso Shinden Ryu curriculum, <br/>
but I don't know whether it was Niten Ichi or from elsewhere.<br/>
<br/>
Best bet is contact your local kendo governing body.<br/>

<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-795353378">Hello,<br/>
 There are practitioners of the Niten Ichi ryu still training in Japan. <br/>
Places to search regarding this training are... www.e-budo.com, and <br/>
www.koryu.com, both excellant sites that contain vast amounts of information <br/>
or access to information on both Koryu ('old' martial traditions of Japan) <br/>
and Bujutsu in general and specific terms.<br/>
 Regarding the Niten Ichi ryu..I can tell you that the current Soke is the <br/>
10th in the lineage..His name is Imai Masayuki Sensei. The Dojo that he <br/>
trains in is situated in Oita prefecture in Japan and trains in Kenjutsu, <br/>
Kodachi, and of course, Nitto (two sword techniques.).<br/>
 Best of luck with your search!<br/>
 Abayo.<br/>
