<h3>NHK Taiga Dramas</h3>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1366050586">Hello! My name is Sally, and I'm very interested in feudal Japan. I'm not<br/>
studying it in college, though I sometimes wish I was, because I find<br/>
Japanese culture and history fascinating. I guess you could say that at this<br/>
point, my interest is more on the level of a hobby. I doubt my knowledge is<br/>
anywhere near as expansive as most of the people on this list. But I do know<br/>
more about feudal Japan (especially Sengoku period) than the average person<br/>
in the U.S.<br/>
<br/>
Anyway, this is my first post here, and I feel bad because I'm not sure if<br/>
it's totally on topic. As you probably know, the newest taiga drama "Toshiie<br/>
and Matsu" is starting pretty soon. Well, at least here in the Bay Area, it<br/>
starts next week. ^_^ I'm not going to ask about the historical accuracy of<br/>
the taiga dramas, at least not yet! I'm sure all sorts of debates have and<br/>
will come up about such accuracy. After all, they *are* dramas, so they're<br/>
going to be written in such a way to grasp the emotions of those who are<br/>
watching. (I admit it, I bawled at the end of "Hojo Tokimune". Ah well.<br/>
Emotional me. ^_^) But the good thing about the dramas, I think, is that<br/>
they generate a great deal of interest in Japanese history... as it did for<br/>
me when I first laid eyes on "Nobunaga, King of Zipangu" and other such<br/>
shows.<br/>
<br/>
Whew, I like to ramble, don't I? Actually, what I really want to know is if<br/>
anyone has, or can point me to, a list of all the taiga dramas NHK has<br/>
produced. I've been searching for one everywhere and haven't been able to<br/>
find it. It doesn't help that my knowledge of Japanese language is not very<br/>
broad. Ah well. If anyone can help me (or if you want to comment on<br/>
something I've said) it would be much appreciated!<br/>

on video for rental.<br/>
    You might also ask Onishi-san at Japan Video, he might point you in the<br/>
right direction.<br/>
