<div id="ygrps-yiv-383993458">Good Evening you all!!!<br/>
<br/>
    First of all, I would like to introduce myself. My name is Natan Ruiz, I´m brazilian student (architecture). Obviously in deep interest on japanese ancient culture and samurai tradicion. Iaijutsu and Kenjutsu student as well. <br/>
<br/>
    I found this group on Samurai Archives page, and I feel really pleased to join this mailing list, which it seems to be an outstanding source of knowledge and communication with people just like me. Domo Arigatô Gozaimashitá! =)<br/>
<br/>
Anyway, I invoque the attention of experts and "sempais" to call some help!!<br/>
<br/>
I´m in need of some material about the European influence over Japan. And I say I´m REALLY in need of it, in order to accomplish a project. Portuguese arrivals and the jesuits, so as the trade relations with daymios, but specially in care of the introduction of Christianism, and the great cultural conflict with buddhism, and japanese manners, IN DETAILS. I´ve spent lot of time in reserch, but not very sucessfull. Maybe because it´s a very specific subject, I know that. I´ve had some contact with portuguese authors (Rainer Dahnenhardt) and some institutions, but It´s pretty hard to find support. Since I joined the group, I´m looking all the messages sent here, to see If I find something. (sorry if i´m repeating this subject) Anyway, It would help me a lot if anyone could point me author, books, sites, or even better, spend some time writing about it for me! hehehehe<br/>
<br/>
Please mail me (<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="mailto:rnascimento@...">rnascimento@...</a>) <br/>
And once again, thank you for accepting me! I hope to be helpfull around here!<br/>
<br/>
PS - Sorry about poor english! =/<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Welcome to this group.<br/>
<br/>
Have you read TANEGASHIMA: The Arrival of Europe in Japan by Olof G. Lidin? published by Nias Press (www.niaspress.dk)<br/>
<br/>
I recently bought a copy from Kinokuniya (the Japanese chain bookstore) but have only had time to skim it. It seems to have a very good bibliography and notes.<br/>
<br/>
Anyone else here read it? Opinions?<br/>
<br/>
Also some time ago I read Deus Destroyed by George Ellison which gives a very dramatic picture of the differences between European and Japanese religious belief and ways of thinking.<br/>
<br/>
A very useful Japanese history bibliography page is<br/>
