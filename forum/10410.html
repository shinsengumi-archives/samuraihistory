I am not aware of any large-scale migration from Japan to Persia / Iran. But - I am sure that there were some individual cases over the years.<br/>
<br/>
What do you know about your grandmother? Do you know her maiden (family) name and her given name? What else do you know about her that makes you think she was Japanese?<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-485530750">Hi Chad,<br/>
<br/>
In general, I wouldn't base things on photos of what people look like.  I know that isn't a very satisfying answer, but there are plenty of examples where how someone looks doesn't correlate with their ancestry. <br/>
<br/>
Also, remember that the people of central asia have a lot of the "east asian look" in them.  All I mean by that is a lot of the populations just north of Iran have ethnic groups that "look" chinese or korean or japanese.  And depending on where she is from in Iran, there are different ethnic groups.<br/>
<br/>
If you don't have any actual documentation (names, writing, jewelry, etc...), then your best bet [at some point in the future] would be to do genome sequencing, and see how you (or your parent descended from her) compare.  In particular, if this is a maternal grandmother AND you assume that her mother was of Japanese descent, then you could compare the mitochondrial DNA in her child (your mom or dad) to that of a japanese population (or other populations), and see if there are significant matches.  This isn't my field of expertise, and I don't know how distinct the Japanese population's mitochondrial DNA (as a whole) is relative to the rest of eastern asia, but this could be a future avenue of exploration.<br/>
<br/>
I wouldn't trust the companies that perform human genome sequencing just yet, but in the not too distant future they should be fairly reliable.<br/>
<br/>
If you are looking for documentation, then you should probably consider the Japanese government.  They had very tight population (entering/leaving) controls all the way through WWII.  So, she (or her parents) would almost certainly have to have registered their intent to leave the country and then receive permission.<br/>
