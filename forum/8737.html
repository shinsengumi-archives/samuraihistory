<div id="ygrps-yiv-575164172">The actual formalization of the Bushido code  occurred in the Edo period, but various forms of this code existed as  early as the Heian Period. I am not an expert on the subject of  bushido, but it is my observation that the bushi class followed a code  of ethics/behaviors from the point in which they established themselves  as a definable group in the late 12th century. <br/>
  <br/>
  According to Minoru Kiyota from the University of Wisconsin, there were  4 types of codes based on the time period (Heian, Kamakura, Sengoku,  Tokugawa). The Heian code was based on loyalty and benevolence. The  code of the Kamakura period was called 'bando musha no narai' and  similar to the previous code. The Sengoku code is also based on  loyalty, but in the context of extreme violence. Of course, the  Tokugawa period is when we see the Bushido that most people would  recognize.<br/>
  <br/>
  Bushido Shoshinshu was written  sometime between 1639 and 1730--I do not have a specific date. It is  just my opinion, but I feel that it was just an off-shoot of the  samurai rules created by Ieyasu and written by Suden. If that is the  case, you could argue that the date you are looking for is August 30,  1615.<br/>
  <br/>
  After all that, I really dont have a specific date for Bushido... I  guess it depends on what you want to recongnize as the true Way.  Regional codes existed as well, so Im sure someone has more specific  info than I do. It is a good topic though.<br/>

<h3>RE: [samuraihistory] bushido</h3>
by <i>sinegalm</i>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1841441542">I think Jonathan’s reference to the Bushido Shoshinshu&#27494;&#36947;&#21021;&#24515;&#38598; (by Taira Shigesuke, I think) brings up a very interesting point. The name of the work apparently refers to a collection (集) of writing written for the benefit of &#21021;&#24515;&#32773;, beginners or novices in Bushido. What was the reason for needing to write down the code of Bushido in Bushido Shoshinshu at that particular moment in Japan history? Was it because there was suddenly a bunch of novice samurai around that needed instruction in how to behave properly as a good samurai? Was it because conservatives lamented that young samurai were no longer following the old traditional Bushido ways, and Bushido Shoshinshu was an attempt to re-establish the older traditional behavioral standards of the good ol’ days? Were there simply too many rude, uncouth samurai acting anti-socially? Or was there a political motive? <br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
My own speculation is this. Instead of looking backward to try to re-establish older samurai traditions, the Tokugawa shogunate was trying to establish a brand new innovative model for samurai: to rein in these unruly samurai and convert them from bloodthirsty sengoku-jidai marauders into nice Tokugawa bureaucrats. That is just my own uneducated guess, as I have not read Bushido Shoshinshu.<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
Does anyone know the motivation for the writing of Bushido Shoshinshu? Anyone agree or disagree with my speculation?<br/>
<br/>
