Who was their lord and why did they become Ronin? Who was their <br/>

lot into fiction.<br/>
Anyway, it was the ONLY instance during the Tokugawa in which retainers <br/>
avenged their lord. And - to make things clearer, Ako had 380 samurai: <br/>
only 47 sacrificed their lives...<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> > If true can anyone provide enlightenment?<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Lord Asano of Ako. He had to commit seppuku, and there go your Ronin.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> > Who was their<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Kira, a corrupted Master of ceremonies.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> > Is it true the only 48 were given a samurai's death?<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>As far as I know, they were 47+one who gave up the night before (to <br/>
bonk repeatedly his girlfriend). The 47 committed ritual seppuku, the <br/>
bonker just killed himself in a backstreet of Edo.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> > Where<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>With Lord Asano, at Sengaku temple, Tokyo.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> > I'd be grateful for any relevant information.<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I strongly suggest you check out the movie "Chushingura," the version <br/>
made in the 6os, with Toshiro Mifune. It's available on DVD. If you're <br/>
not into masochism, check out the 1941-42 version - more than 4 hours, <br/>
and you do not ever see the assault on Kira's mansion!!! The one with <br/>
Kim-taku (titled 47/1) is funny, but highly inaccurate. Finally, the <br/>
best version on paper is the bunraku libretto, translated by Donald <br/>
Keene. If I am not wrong, the bunraku play was out in Edo TWO WEEKS <br/>
after the real event took place!<br/>
<br/>
Hope it helped,<br/>
Bye!<br/>

Actually no. The Bito article mentioned below lists four other similar<br/>
instances before the Ako story. Albeit the Ako one is the most elaborate and<br/>
the most famous.<br/>

<br/>
Actually it was 46. One member Terasaka Kichiemon was missing. What happened<br/>
to him is a matter of great debate; some argue he ran away at the last<br/>
moment, others say he was ordered away by Oishi to report either to Asano's<br/>
brother or widow.<br/>

curious to read about the other 4 stories: are you sure they were <br/>

Sorry jumped the gun a bit; the four incidents Bito relates were of attacks<br/>
on Bakufu officials in Edo castle and the response of the government to<br/>
them.<br/>
<br/>
The first was Naramura Magokuro in 1627. Second was Toyoshima Nobumitsu in<br/>
1628. Third was Mizuno Ihei in 1670. Fourth was the famous assassination of<br/>
Hotta Masatoshi by Inaba Masayasu. The exact details can be found in Bito<br/>
article pages 154-155 in Monumenta Nipponica 58:2.</div>

hehehe. However, there was another episode of vendetta of a "lord:" it <br/>
was actually a lady in waiting who avenged the noble woman she was <br/>
working for - I don't have any detail, but I'm positive I've read about <br/>
it. So, it's 2 out of 200 cases...<br/>
<br/>
I can access Monumenta Nipponica Online and download articles on PDF <br/>

anybody know if the last years are online as well?? Or can anybody <br/>

 </span></blockquote>Yes it is true and not a myth,but there was only 47 Ronin and not 49<br/>
Their lord was Asano Takumi no Kami he was the lord of the castle of <br/>
ako in the province of harima,he was at the shoguns palace,and was <br/>
to be instructed on court ceremonies,by Kotsuke no suke, who wanted <br/>
payment for his services when they should be free,one day kotsuke <br/>
insulted Asano Takumi to the point that asano drew his sword and <br/>
struck kotsuke wounding him,asano was arrested and later sentanced <br/>
to commit seppuku his castle was confiscated and his men were told <br/>
to disband which for a samurai ment to become a ronin,they are <br/>
buried at a temple called Sengakuji in the suburb of Takanawa, there <br/>
is a lot more to this story such as more details than i have listed <br/>
but there are several books out there on the subject,<br/>
1 is called The 47 ronin by John Allyn,<br/>
and another is Tales of old japan by A.B.Mitford(Lord redesdale),i <br/>
hope that helps out ..........Dave</div>

 </span></blockquote>So far no one has mentioned the film "The Assasination of Ryoma".  I have a copy<br/>
and it is just magnificent.  The colour, the characters, the whole thing is just<br/>
one unbelievable 4 and a half hours-ish of "WOW" viewing.  No doubt some<br/>
liberties were taken and I don't have the detailed knowledge to comment.<br/>
However, if anyone would care to take this up I'd enjoy reading more about it.<br/>
<br/>
Best regards,<br/>
