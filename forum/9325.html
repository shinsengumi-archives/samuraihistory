<div id="ygrps-yiv-168276547">Good afternoon...<br/>
<br/>
While I do not know the specifics of your question, I will say that it is my understanding that this type of training would have varied from school to school. Perhaps researching a specific school (Yagyu Shinkage Ryu 柳生新陰流, for example) would help? <br/>
<br/>
My area of expertise is philosophy and seppuku, not the sword, but I have two books to suggest:<br/>
<br/>
The Japanese Sword by Gregory Irvine<br/>
Kendo by Minoru Kiyota<br/>
<br/>
Kiyota's book has a good portion of information regarding the history of kendo, and the Irvine book deals with the sword and swordsmanship throughout various time periods.<br/>
<br/>
Good luck...<br/>
