VISITORS to the Great Yorkshire Show have seen most things in its <br/>
167-year history, but next week a Samurai warrior will mingle with <br/>
thousands of animals at the North's leading agricultural showcase.<br/>
The Royal Armouries Museum is taking part of its spectacular summer <br/>
exhibition, Shogun  The Life of Lord Tokugawa Ieyasu, to the three-<br/>
day event which starts on the 150-acre showground in Harrogate on <br/>
Tuesday. <br/>
Honourary show director Christopher Hall yesterday found himself <br/>
using his traditional 'badge of office', a ramshorn shepherd's <br/>
crook, to ward off blows from a Samurai sword wielded by the <br/>
museum's senior interpreter Andy Deane. <br/>
For four centuries Japan has guarded the treasures belonging to its <br/>
greatest statesman and Shogun, Lord Tokugawa Ieyasu. Now, for the <br/>
first time, 80 artefacts  screens, costumes, weapons, armour, art, <br/>
scrolls and furniture  are on display at the Royal Armouries in <br/>
Leeds until August 30. <br/>
But the Royal Armouries travelling exhibition is not all Japanese. <br/>
A corner of the showground near the Gold Gate will be transformed <br/>
into a Medieval castle where Mr Deane and his colleagues will <br/>
demonstrate fighting skills from another era. <br/>
They will wear 80lbs of full plate armour to fight with a pollaxe  <br/>
a long double-handed staff with an axe-like blade. <br/>
Mr Deane, who came north to the Royal Armouries after working at the <br/>
Tower of London, said: "My parents were very good to me, giving me a <br/>
love of history. I learned to ride and a misspent youth has allowed <br/>
me to work at the Royal Armouries." <br/>
Museum director Peter Armstrong said: "We are all about igniting <br/>
people's interest in history and going on tour is crucial to the <br/>
development of the museum." <br/>
Mr Hall, who hands over the role of show director to Bill Cowling <br/>
after this year's show ends, said: "We are delighted to welcome the <br/>
Royal Armouries as they will certainly add another dimension to the <br/>
show." <br/>
Yorkshire Post reporters and photographers will bring a <br/>
comprehensive results and news service from the show throughout its <br/>
three days of competitive events  starting on Tuesday morning with <br/>
reports from the Yorkshire Agriculture Society's preview day.<br/>
