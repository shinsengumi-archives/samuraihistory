<div id="ygrps-yiv-1240535398">Sounds more like something out of a bad romance novel<br/>
than anything historical. You don't have any more<br/>
details? The main thing that bothers me is that geisha<br/>
didn't really exist, as such, until later in the<br/>
Tokugawa. There were courtesans, but they weren't<br/>
called geisha at the time. <br/>

<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1181075532">1. Refrain from calling anyone an asshole,<br/>
please--especially one who has the power of whether or<br/>
not you can post to this list. The only reason I'm<br/>
letting you by is because you referred to me--had you<br/>
called anyone else a "cynical asshole", I'd<br/>
immediately ban you from the list. Since you directed<br/>
it at me, you get a second chance. <br/>
<br/>
2. Just because something started IN the Edo period,<br/>
doesn't mean it began in the same year the period<br/>
began. <br/>
<br/>
Try here:<br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://geisya.cutegirl.jp/geisyanorekisi.html">http://geisya.cutegirl.jp/geisyanorekisi.html</a><br/>
<br/>
First thing on the page says at the "END" of the Edo<br/>
period. This is the first webpage that came up in my<br/>
google search. <br/>
<br/>
In case you can't read Japanese, here's another: <br/>
<br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://oldworld.sjsu.edu/asiangate/floating_world/geishah.html">http://oldworld.sjsu.edu/asiangate/floating_world/geishah.html</a><br/>
<br/>
This pins it at 1770, though I'm not sure it could be<br/>
that exact. However it perfectly explains the<br/>
difference between "Geisha" (�|&#65533;&#65533;&#65533;j"art persons", and<br/>
"Yujo", prostitutes. <br/>
<br/>
3. It's no one's "JOB" to help you. And if you'll shut<br/>
your trap and read, you'll see I was TRYING too--YOU<br/>
NEED TO GIVE US MORE DETAILS THAN THIS. Chances are<br/>
someone here can find your samurai, if you have more<br/>
information. Telling me he was involved in Sekigahara<br/>
doesn't mean squat--there were over 100,000 samurai<br/>
involved in Sekigahara, not counting multiple<br/>
side-battles. Telling me he deserted his lord because<br/>
he was in love with a Geisha tells me squat, because<br/>
you are using the term incorrectly. GEISHA were a mid<br/>
to late Edo period development. In 1600, the Edo<br/>
period BEGAN. ERGO, He couldn't have been in love with<br/>
a geisha. Courtesan, yes. Geisha, no. <br/>
<br/>
4. If you get pissed off everytime someone says this<br/>
sounds like something out of a bad romance novel,<br/>
you're going to be in for a lot of anger management<br/>
sessions. Perhaps I should have said "out of a bad<br/>
Chikamatsu play" or "Ihara Saikaku" novel. Would that<br/>
have bruised your ego less? <br/>
<br/>
LISTEN UP, EVERYONE: I'VE HAD IT! If you're going to<br/>
take anything said to you personally when you ask a<br/>
question with no clarifying information and incorrect<br/>
background, then don't ask the question! This is an<br/>
email list meant to perpetuate a flow of information<br/>
and KNOWLEDGE! If what you think you know is WRONG,<br/>
someone will tell you. DEAL WITH IT! I've been wrong,<br/>
Kitsuno's been wrong, Tony's been wrong...sometime, I<br/>
think, in 1999...point is, people who study this stuff<br/>
for a living make mistakes too--therefore, if it is<br/>
your first time here, DO NOT get bent out of shape,<br/>
okay? <br/>
<br/>
No one is "yuk(king) it up". And the only thing<br/>
standing in your way is your lack of any identifiable<br/>
details that can allow others to help identify this<br/>
person. <br/>

 </span></blockquote>Well, you could have fooled me!!  Those with long memories will know exactly<br/>
to what I'm referring!!  I like a list with a bit of spice and armour plated<br/>
egos coupled with hard-won expert knowledge and I have a VERY thick skin -<br/>
BUT - I have on more than one occasion received list replies to my pitiful<br/>
offerings from at least two individuals that could have been interpreted as<br/>
sarcasm or put-downs.  I have chosen to interpret these as blunt humour or<br/>
sardonic humour or... (email not being an easy medium in which to express<br/>
such concepts).  I have also perceived it dealt out to others with<br/>
consequent apologies for being misunderstood when the recipients squawked<br/>
"ABUSE..."<br/>
<br/>
I smiled at the armour-piercing humour of "Tenshi, Rose, and Toni<br/>
<<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="mailto:madmadotakuchick@...">madmadotakuchick@...</a>>" coupled with a velvet glove challenge whacked<br/>
across the cheek because I'm quite used to it.<br/>
<br/>
OK (1) - now rip the stuffing out of this reply if you are so inclined...<br/>
<br/>
OK (2) - now to be useful.  There was a Daimyo in the Edo period who, having<br/>
just inherited his fief, did indeed shortly thereafter fall in love with a<br/>
geisha.  It must be true because I read it somewhere in the last 40 years of<br/>
my lust in reading about swords and the samurai.  This man was besotted with<br/>
the lass and squandered his family's fortune to the extent that he was<br/>
dis-inherited by the Shogunate.  This story may have been in Mitford's<br/>
"Tales of the Samurai", Lafcadio Hearn's 2-volume set that I have, in a<br/>
similar such book of tales, or in one of the many Sword Society journals I<br/>
have gathered over the years.<br/>
<br/>
So, I can verify "Tenshi, Rose, and Toni <<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="mailto:madmadotakuchick@...">madmadotakuchick@...</a>>'s"<br/>
observation that the story has credibility in my reading.  As for a name of<br/>
the samurai, it was in the story but I cannot remember it.  If anyone is<br/>
serious about the name I'll have an archeaological dig into my voluminous<br/>
library...<br/>
<br/>
Can I close by thanking those who devote so much time to the great success<br/>
of the list and to enlighten many of us lesser mortals with their<br/>
encyclopaedic knowledge of the Samurai.  I dips my lid to 'ee.<br/>
<br/>

more on this, or even where you found it, I can guarantee that no one <br/>

<br/>
":YOU_ think it's out of a bad romance novel, it isn't. I won't <br/>

<br/>
is absolutely worthless information, and after posting something like <br/>
that I seriously doubt anyone will even be interested in helping you. <br/>
Do you want actual information on this, or are you just trying to <br/>
play some childish quiz game?  If you are playing some sort of quiz <br/>
game, I dont think anyone else is playing.  If you WANT information, <br/>
you are going to need to be more specific.  <br/>

Another word of friendly advice, if you get offended every time <br/>
anyone says anything that doesnt sit well with you, you are not going <br/>
to get far in life, or you will give yourself a heart attack.<br/>

Regardless, it makes sense to me that if you ask a question, you try <br/>

didnt do if he is now bragging about having other information.  <br/>
Anyway, these groups are pretty easy, but not always a one way <br/>

doesnt mean they will do it willingly. People tend to want a reason <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-406443500">My use of the phrase "bad romance novel" in no way,<br/>

something somewhere, potentially fictional, and<br/>
believes it to be real. Fine--no problem. To me, it<br/>
doesn't sound real. It certainly doesn't sound like<br/>
anything I'm familiar with, at least with no further<br/>

It is not the responsibility of anyone on this board<br/>

the right to incorrectly believe geisha existed in<br/>

tell you that you are incorrect and present facts<br/>
dirty names. <br/>
<br/>
My reply may have been sardonic, but was not<br/>
offensive. I didn't call anyone any names. As a<br/>
subordinate list moderator, I was well within my<br/>
rights granted by Kitsuno to simply delete the email<br/>

an attack directly on me--I chose not to act so I<br/>
could not be accused of acting out of malice. Kitsuno<br/>
can decide to ban or not ban, delete or not delete. <br/>

<h3>Re: [samuraihistory] Re: Samurai Inquiry</h3>
by <i>murrayjj60644</i>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1145317286">Hello Brothers; <br/>
   Firstly i am new to the forum and as i have been reading along the past few days i have seen truly, in my humble opinion...the best gathering of shared knowledge, truth, and comraderie since my days as a U.S. Marine. Stating that everyone here has a passion for the subject and era(s) would be a gross understatement. I have been reading & researching Japanese history for the better part of my life and i am finally within a group where i feel i can converse openly, freely & most of all...continue to learn. Please pardon me for being overly ecstatic, but this forum is just truly what i have been looking for in a nutshell. I have recently returned from Okinawa, Japan...but luckily for me i am sure none of you will hold that against me (i hope that was funny to some, give me a little face...please) but have been over mainland Japan as well and there are not many places in Japan or Asia period that i have not traveled. On my own or through the U.S. Military. So i offer my modest thanks and praise for being able to exist within the forum...<br/>
     Secondly; i agree with the statements of Mr. Wayland...to request for information one must truly want to seek the truth. As i am sure we all know, one of the staples of Bushido was that it was commonplace to seek constructive criticism from your peers...for as Tsunetomo said: "If you judge and manage every affair while depending only on your small learning and wisdom...etc." The point is that you cannot ask a question with the intention of getting only the answer you desire.<br/>
     Thirdly; i wanted to acquire some books or writings if possible explaining the history of the Yakuza as a sort of "police force" in their origination, i am not sure if this is correct, but i am really looking for a sort of timeline from their beginning and how they progressed and changed. Any assistance in this manner would be extremely grateful. Continued Blessings!<br/>
