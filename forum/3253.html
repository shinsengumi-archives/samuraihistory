	Several things to consider here. Are your swords traditionally made <br/>
(preferably signed) Japanese swords? OR are they Paul Chen, Michael <br/>
Bell, Howard Clark swords or Showa-to (swords from the war years)? The <br/>
first can be licensed and carried in Japan the second group cannot. <br/>
laws restricting the ownership of Swords are strict but not onerous. <br/>
The best thing to do is establish yourself in Japan, leave your swords <br/>
at home. Once you have a visa, job and address have your swords sent to <br/>
you. They will be sent to the Head office of the Post Office in your <br/>
prefecture (though they are addressed to you). This office is not <br/>
always in a convenient place; if you live in Kanagawa you have to go to <br/>
Tokyo.<br/>
	Once every two months there is a shinsa at the post office you will <br/>
have to present yourself there on the appointed day. Your package will <br/>
be opened by a government appointed appraiser who will make the <br/>
determination if your sword is a weapon or if it has potential value as <br/>
a collectible. If it passes shinsa, you will have to pay something like <br/>
$100 per sword or a little less and then your swords will be sent to <br/>
you along with a registration card. This card must be carried with the <br/>
sword at all times and you must present it to the police if asked. Once <br/>
the blade is registered you will likely never be asked for the <br/>
registration (until you leave)and will be free to travel about with <br/>
your sword.<br/>
	If your sword is deemed a weapon it must be returned to the country of <br/>
origin. If you fail to report for shinsa and fail to notify the post <br/>
office it will be returned to the country of origin or confiscated. You <br/>
can bring your swords into Japan on the plane, provided the airline <br/>
lets you, these days it is tougher and tougher. When you get to the <br/>
airport tell the authorities you have swords and are requesting a <br/>
shinsa and registration. A police inspector will be called and he can <br/>
take hours to show, that is why you tell them the moment you get off <br/>
the plane. At the airport police station they will do a shinsa and <br/>
issue you a temporary registration. If you have your act together this <br/>
may only add an hour or so to your time at the airport. Remember the <br/>
police inspector typically doesn't know swords as well as the <br/>
inspectors at the post office. If he doesn't like the swords, they will <br/>
have to be sent back, expensive and time consuming.<br/>
	If you have a Sensei or know a sword dealer in your area, they could <br/>
act as your agent, the swords could be sent ahead and be waiting for <br/>
you. However this is a huge pain in the A**, and is a lot to ask <br/>
someone who is not your dearest of friends. Frankly no amount of money <br/>
makes the registration part of handling swords profitable...<br/>
