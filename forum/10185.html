     *Samurai Week in Washington, D.C.*<br/>
<br/>
The 150th Anniversary of the First Japanese Diplomatic Mission to the U.S.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
*150 years ago, the world had yet to discover Japan, and the people of Japan<br/>
had never seen America...*<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
*The landing of the Japanese Embassy of Japan, with the treat in a box, at<br/>
the Navy Yard, Washington. *<br/>
Printed in Harper’s Weekly May 26, 1860. Library of Congress.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
In the years before the American Civil War, 77 samurai crossed the sea as<br/>
Japan’s first diplomatic mission to the U.S., captivating the American<br/>
people and the press. Everywhere they went, large crowds turned out to see<br/>
them, fascinated by their traditional clothing, top-knot hairstyle, and<br/>
prominent samurai swords. Bearing the honor and responsibility of ushering<br/>
Japan into the modern era, the mission was officially charged with the<br/>
ratification of the Treaty of Friendship, Commerce and Navigation. But they<br/>
accomplished so much more, laying the foundations of the rich relationship<br/>
Japan and the U.S. share today and setting the stage for the next 150 years<br/>
of cultural exchange.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
In commemoration of the 150th anniversary of their historic visit, a number<br/>
of special events will take place as part of Samurai Week in Washington,<br/>
D.C. Please join us in appreciating the origins of the rich relationship<br/>
Japan and the U.S. share today!<br/>
