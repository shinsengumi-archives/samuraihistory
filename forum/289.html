In death, Kurosawa remains hot movie property<br/>

<br/>
NEW YORK (Reuters) - The emperor of Japanese cinema Akira Kurosawa is <br/>
dead. Long live the emperor. <br/>
Japanese movie director extraordinaire Kurosawa, who died in 1998 at <br/>
the age of 88, has been a major player in the global movie market <br/>
over the past few years, albeit posthumously. <br/>
<br/>
In July, two production deals were inked with U.S. companies to make <br/>
English-language versions of Kurosawa classics, which helped put <br/>
Japanese cinema on the world map. <br/>
<br/>
Kurosawa has been hailed as one of the greatest filmmakers ever for <br/>
his tales of samurai, detectives, businessmen and petty bureaucrats <br/>
that struck at the heart of the human psyche and were steeped in <br/>
ambiguity. <br/>
<br/>
Since his death Kurosawa has landed screen credits for writing <br/>
scripts for two new movies. <br/>
<br/>
"There are a lot of people in Hollywood thinking of making their own <br/>
version of a Kurosawa classic," one U.S. movie executive said. <br/>
<br/>
The recent deals that have been struck include a pact between <br/>
Hollywood's Harbor Light Entertainment and Kurosawa's movie <br/>
production company to make a U.S. version of the Kurosawa <br/>
classic "Rashomon." <br/>
<br/>
The other deal is with a production company affiliated with acclaimed <br/>
director and Kurosawa fan Martin Scorsese, which will do a remake of <br/>
the kidnapping thriller "High and Low" (Tengoku to Jigoku). <br/>
<br/>
"We are looking to make a contemporary thriller set in mid- to small-<br/>
town America," Edwin Marshall of Harbor Light said of his company's <br/>
planned remake of "Rashomon," which many critics call Kurosawa's most <br/>
famous work. <br/>
<br/>
Marshall lived in Japan and spent some time on the set with Kurosawa. <br/>
His partner Stuart Calcote is a Japan-hand who played a key role in <br/>
landing "Rashomon". <br/>
<br/>
REVERENCE FOR THE MASTER <br/>
<br/>
Marshall said that Harbor Light is approaching their "Rashomon" <br/>
remake with reverence to the movie whose title has become a catchword <br/>
for the inability to ever know the truth about a certain situation. <br/>
<br/>
Harbor Light scored the movie after lengthy discussions with <br/>
Kurosawa's son Hisao. The company is in talks with an Academy Award-<br/>
nominated writer for the screenplay of the film they aim to produce <br/>
for about $40 million. <br/>
<br/>
Kurosawa's "Rashomon" (1951) is set in medieval Japan and tells of <br/>
the rape of a nobleman's bride by a bandit. The point of view from <br/>
the movie is from the participants and a witness, and each character <br/>
recounts the incident in a way that shines favorable light on them. <br/>
<br/>
The movie won the Grand Prix at the Venice International Film <br/>
Festival, which was the first major international recognition ever <br/>
achieved by a Japanese filmmaker. <br/>
<br/>
In the other remake deal announced in July, entertainment trade paper <br/>
Variety reported that Brazilian director Walter Salles, whose 1998 <br/>
film "Central Station" was Oscar-nominated for best foreign-language <br/>
picture, will remake "High and Low" after Kurosawa's production <br/>
company willed the rights to the movie to Scorsese's Cappa <br/>
Productions. <br/>
<br/>
Disney's Touchstone Pictures is thinking of making the movie but has <br/>
yet to "greenlight" the project, it said. Cappa Production officials <br/>
were not immediately available for comment. <br/>
<br/>
"I have a feeling that a lot of Kurosawa's movies will be remade over <br/>
time," acclaimed director Wayne Wang ("The Joy Luck Club" and "Smoke" <br/>
told Reuters. <br/>
<br/>
"A lot of people have not seen the originals and Americans are always <br/>
looking for good material to remake," Wang said, adding that he sees <br/>
a cycle brewing for Kurosawa remakes. <br/>
<br/>
KUROSAWA AND HOLLYWOOD <br/>
<br/>
The interest in remaking Kurosawa is nothing new. <br/>
<br/>
Kurosawa's "The Seven Samurai" (1954) inspired the American <br/>
Western "The Magnificent Seven" (1960), which boosted the career of <br/>
Steve McQueen. <br/>
<br/>
Italian director Sergio Leone made a version of Kurosawa's "Yojimbo" <br/>
(1961) as the spaghetti Western "A Fistful of Dollars"(1964), which <br/>
helped make Clint Eastwood a movie star. The movie was remade again <br/>
in 1996 under the title "Last Man Standing" with Bruce Willis as the <br/>
star. <br/>
<br/>
Kurosawa's historical spectacle "The Hidden Fortress" (1958) was <br/>
credited by George Lucas as an important source for "Star Wars." <br/>
And "Rashomon" had a Hollywood remake in the guise of a quickly <br/>
forgotten Western called Outrage (1964), which had Paul Newman <br/>
playing the part of the bandit. <br/>
<br/>
Kurosawa also borrowed from western classics with movies such as 1985 <br/>
feudal Japan war tale "Ran", which was based on William Shakespeare's <br/>
play "King Lear". <br/>
<br/>
In his native Japan, where Kurosawa toiled as a fringe figure in the <br/>
movie industry for years despite his international fame, Kurosawa <br/>
scripts became a hot property after his death. <br/>
<br/>
Japanese studio Nikkatsu produced a movie about a sword-slinging <br/>
gangster based on a screenplay by Kurosawa and Keisuke Kinoshita <br/>
called "Dora Heita", which came out about a year ago. <br/>
<br/>
Kurosawa's production company took a screenplay from the great <br/>
Japanese director that had not been filmed to make the movie "Ame <br/>
Agaru" (After the Rain). The movie is about a samurai trying to find <br/>
work in changing times and came from a screenplay from Kurosawa with <br/>
his directorial notes. <br/>
<br/>
Kurosawa planned to shoot the movie a few years ago, but illness <br/>
prevented him from starting the film. <br/>
<br/>
"What I hope for more than anything else is that Kurosawa's genius <br/>
will continue to influence the industry," U.S. "Rashomon" producer <br/>
Marshall said.</div>
