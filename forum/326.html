<h3>Re: [samuraihistory] Re: In Memoriam</h3>

<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1597855386">Hello all,<br/>
 This is a personal response to the mail I saw with the article from the <br/>
Canadian newspaper...I am British, first off and truly resent the statements <br/>
decrying the U.K.'s involvement in the 'clean up' operation and any events <br/>
pursuant to the attacks. My question is just what else can we do in Britain <br/>
to aid the U.S. at this time? We are sending Blood, firemen, police, and <br/>
others with knowledge of how to help in the aftermath of a bomb strike  <br/>
(terrorist activity), our Prime Minister has declared that we will stand <br/>
firmly behind any plans the U.S. has to seek 'vengeance' on the guilty party <br/>
here...But as a country we are no where near rich enough to supply the <br/>
amounts that are needed to truly help. We are doing all that we can to aid <br/>
the States at this time but could never supply aid equal to that given by the <br/>
U.S. and others in the Second World War. Here is the point...The U.S. has <br/>
always been looked upon as the 'saviour of the free world', a kind of 'big <br/>
brother' with the power to help in nearly all situations. Some may say that <br/>
it is that level of involvement that has made the U.S. the target for the <br/>
terrorist parties. My heart truly goes out to all involved in this atrocity, <br/>
(see my previous post) But the implication in the article is that we are <br/>
standing idly by while the U.S. is attacked. This cannot be farther from the <br/>
truth. If the point of the e-mail was to show the stupidity of some reporters <br/>
on the case then my points should be disregarded, sorry. But the world does <br/>
not need any more rift building and division, blame, or guilt than is already <br/>
present. Articles like this sow discord and in my opinion should not be <br/>
posted on an international forum like this one. We need to join together if <br/>
there is any hope in finding and dealing with the guilty here....We cannot <br/>
easily do this if people continually lay the guilt for it on countries that <br/>
are genuinly trying to help clear up the situation. Please, take care with <br/>
the articles allowed to be shown here. It is not the U.S. against the world, <br/>
but the world against the mindless scum willing to commit these attacks.<br/>
 Sorry if I cause offense here...That is not my intention. Once again, my <br/>
heartfelt condolences goes to all those who have suffered as a result of this.<br/>

<br/>
Take no offense--that article was written in 1973, and refers to the US after <br/>
the Vietnam War.  The author died in the early 1980s, if I'm not mistaken.<br/>
<br/>
"US bashing" has been popular worldwide for years, and America quietly takes <br/>
it.  It has been wonderful seeing the response to Tuesday's bombings from the <br/>
UK (especially to the recent BBC debate TV show that showed an unusually high <br/>
number of anti-US participants--y'all shut them down quickly!).  Germany has <br/>
also been surprisingly supportive.  You are acting not merely as allies, but <br/>
as friends.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks for the support--nobody over here is mad at Britain today!<br/>
<br/>
Cordially,<br/>
