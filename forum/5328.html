 </span></blockquote>Simply put, no. There were no "ranks", as such. Often<br/>
times you'll see the same subordinates referred to as<br/>
different "ranks". For instance, in one passage<br/>
Hideyoshi, Katsuie, and Nagahide may be referred to as<br/>
three of Nobunaga's "Generals"...later on you may see<br/>
them described as his "lieutenants" or "captains".<br/>
These aren't meant to delineate rank, but more to show<br/>
a relationship--Nobunaga is the boss, and those three<br/>
are his subordinate leaders. <br/>
<br/>
The problem is that many times you see things<br/>
translated into English that appear to be ranks, when<br/>
they are actually job titles. "Taisho", often<br/>
translated as general, isn't a rank--it's a job title.<br/>
It refers to someone who leads a large body of troops.<br/>
That could be 10,000 troops, or 300. Obviously if you<br/>
lead 10,000 you are probably more important, and of<br/>
higher "rank" than the guy with only 300, but you're<br/>
still both "Taisho". <br/>
<br/>
Similiarly, you'll see things like "Ashigaru-gashira",<br/>
etc., but again, these are job titles, not ranks. A<br/>
"Kashira" is the head of a particular unit, so the<br/>
ashigaru-kashira would be the leader of a small unit<br/>
of ashigaru, kind of like a platoon leader in the<br/>
modern army. <br/>
<br/>
Bottom line, there were no sergeants, lieutenants,<br/>
captains, majors, etc. But there were squad leaders,<br/>
platoon leaders, company commanders, battalion<br/>
commanders, etc. Of course, there was no standard<br/>
"battalion" size like in a modern army, so if Lord A<br/>
was a minor lord who only had 200 ment to lead into<br/>
battle, you might call that a battalion...but you<br/>
might also call Lord B's 3,000 men a battalion...<br/>
<br/>
Difficult, no?<br/>

Nate I agree with you in the main here. I would have probably chosen <br/>
a different set of words - that is, there was no "rank an promotion" <br/>
system where a person with x amount of experience or know-how would <br/>
get promoted to the next 'level'.<br/>
<br/>
At the same time I think it's fair to say that there were certainly jo<br/>
bs, or posts, or stations that were more important or prestigious, and <br/>
jobs that were less important and prestigious. In that sense it can be <br/>
said that there were 'ranks'.<br/>
<br/>
On top of that there were of course the ranks in terms of the <br/>
Shoku-i 職位 system.<br/>

<br/>
This is very well said! In fact (as you and I have exchanged on this <br/>
list before), even the title Shogun is not in essence a "rank". It <br/>
is really a job description. IN fact the title "Shogun" is not even <br/>
part of the Shoku-i ranking system.<br/>

<br/>
Ah - here's what I was getting at. But beyond this, of course an <br/>
ashigaru is lower than a taisho. So at some level wouldn't you be <br/>
able to call this a 'rank'?<br/>
<br/>
Then of course to confuse matters more we have that Ashigaru <br/>
Taisho.....<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
This specific example seems in my way of thinking to blur the lines a <br/>
bit. It seems to me that once 'promoted' to ashigaru-gashira a person <br/>
would not go back to being a plain ashigaru. In other words this one <br/>
seems more like a permanent promotion rather than just a <br/>
battle-by-battle job assignment. What do you think?<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>But those aren't ranks. They're JOBS. There's a difference, and it's a fairly<br/>
critical one. Ranks tend to have a consistency. A lieutenant always has X-number<br/>
of people under him, a major X-number of people, a general X-number and so on. A<br/>
taisho can have 50, 500, or 5,000.<br/>
<br/>
The most basic "rank" -- that of kashira or taicho^, doesn't even have a number.<br/>
A taicho^ (lit. "group-chief") can have five people or 50 under him, depending on<br/>
the job and the specific assignment.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> > On top of that there were of course the ranks in terms of the <br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Yes, but the Ritsuryo^ Code has nothing to do with this. :)<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>No, again, due to the big difference between the concept of "rank" and "job".<br/>
You could call ashigaru a *class* of samurai, perhaps, but it's not a rank per<br/>
se. Ashigaru had different functions. Some might be section or squad leaders<br/>
(taicho^ or kashira) or what have you; sometimes "full-fledged samurai" might<br/>
hold those positions.<br/>
<br/>
The thing is, it is VERY important to divorce the concept of terminology of<br/>
MILITARY rank from samurai -- they just don't operate on the same level. There<br/>
is rank, yes, but that's SOCIAL rank, not military rank.<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>There's no rule. In any feudally structured army, ALL positions and duties are<br/>
held at the pleasure of the overlord in question. There is no way to say "I'm a<br/>
first sergeant, you can't make me a private without due cause and a<br/>
court-martial." Even "permanent" appointments (such as that of a taicho^) in a<br/>
Japanese army were understood to be continued appointments that could be<br/>
withdrawn at any time (or magnified with further postings) and not one's "right"<br/>
to the position.<br/>

are still jobs. Not ranks. <br/>

 </span></blockquote>No. While the position is obviously higher than a<br/>
footsoldier, it's still not a RANK. It's a job. You<br/>
don't make "Taisho 3rd Class".  <br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> > Then of course to confuse matters more we have that<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Who leads a larger group of ashigaru than a<br/>
ashigaru-kashira, but is still performing a JOB. <br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>A company commander is higher than a platoon leader,<br/>
and once you're a company commander you're not going<br/>
to ever go back to being a platoon leader. However,<br/>
they're both still JOBS....descriptions of<br/>
function...not RANKS. <br/>
<br/>
Put it this way: in the modern military, ranks<br/>
generally coincide with certain job positions. A squad<br/>
leader is usually a Staff Sergeant, a platoon sergeant<br/>
usually a Sergeant First Class. A platoon leader is<br/>
usually a lieutenant (normally 2nd LT), a company XO<br/>
is a 1st LT, a company commander is a Captain, majors<br/>
hold the main battalion staff positions, such as XO, a<br/>
battalion commander is a lieutanant colonel, a brigade<br/>
commander is a colonel, etc. Why is it this way?<br/>
Because the US Army says that those are the ranks that<br/>
go with those positions--someone with the experience<br/>
and skill to get promoted to COL should be able to<br/>
handle the command of a Brigade, etc. HOWEVER, they<br/>
are not equal. I'm a captain, but have not had command<br/>
yet--I'm filling a staff position. I filled a staff<br/>
position at my last assignment also. So while my rank<br/>
has not changed, nor will it in the next few years, my<br/>
POSITION has, and will. I will take company command in<br/>
a year or so--but that doesn't change my RANK. See the<br/>
difference? <br/>
<br/>
There WAS no rank system in a sengoku army. Don't<br/>
confuse ranks with "ranking". Obviously some people<br/>
were more important than others, and some jobs were<br/>
more prestigious, etc. But you didn't start as<br/>
Ashigaru 2nd Class, work up to Ashigaru 1st Class,<br/>
then Gunsou, then 2nd Samurai, then 1st Samurai, etc. <br/>
<br/>
You simply can't fit the square Sengoku army peg into<br/>
the round modern military hole. <br/>
<br/>
Even today, at work I take advantage of the difference<br/>
between rank and job title. Our office liaisons with<br/>
Japanese 3 and 4 star level officers (generals,<br/>
admirals, etc) regularly. I'm a nobody as a simple<br/>
captain. But I use my job title, not my rank--Deputy<br/>
Operations Officer sounds much better to them then<br/>
using my rank, which is the lower than the guy who<br/>
gets their coffee in the morning. <br/>

and could be taken away at any time. Even in European<br/>
armies at this time, there wasn't a coherent rank<br/>
structure as we see today--you might have a few<br/>
"lieutenants" or "captains" as subordinate managers,<br/>
and a "sergeant at arms" or two to enforce discipline,<br/>
but again, there weren't ranks like they developed<br/>
into, not yet. <br/>

not entirely sure what happened--the Union army had<br/>
BG's as BDE commanders too. Where the split was, I<br/>
don't know--I think it was when we ballooned in WWI,<br/>
and you simply couldn't have that many generals<br/>
waltzing around. <br/>
<br/>
It's always bothered me that a Major General is lower<br/>
than a Lieutenant General--then I learned that it used<br/>

Nate - again I'm agreeing with you here. :) I think the issue is <br/>
probably more or less in how we are both coming at the (English) work <br/>
'rank'.<br/>

Here I think is where it looks like we're just using different <br/>
terminology. Which is what I was trying to get at by saying "rank <br/>
and promotion". We can probably agree more violently if we change <br/>
the terms slightly. Would you agree to the phrase, for instance, that <br/>
a taisho outranks an ashigaru?<br/>

<br/>
I do. But then again, I think that your personal experience and your <br/>
technical expertise is coloring too much the way you are using the <br/>
word rank. But then again again, I don't know how the original <br/>
poster really meant the question either - so I might be the only one <br/>
here who sees this my way (wouldn't be the first time....)<br/>

Yes, exactly. Which is (again) what I meant by the "rank and <br/>

wanted it to.<br/>

Absolutely agreed - believe me. However, the round modern military <br/>
hole is not the one and only way to understand the word "rank", <br/>
either.<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I think people would generally be surprised at how modern the concept of <br/>
rank-structure in armies is. Actually, the Romans were very rank/office set with <br/>
the way they did their legions (the first modern armies, afterall), and after <br/>
them it was centuries before anything like it was recreated. I think that it <br/>
might be a factor of the "equality" of a republican form of government that <br/>
created that modern army, as it was certainly not a typical feudal structure <br/>
like that which pervaded Europe from the Normans on, until GA's "new model army" <br/>
-- and even then it was looser than we think of ranks today. It's interesting to <br/>
note that the forerunners of many of our modern "ranks" were actually rather <br/>
unique positions and functions under older armies (like your example of sergeant <br/>
at arms, or color sergeant or ensign, or...<br/>

 </span></blockquote>I'm using it in the sense the original poster meant<br/>
it, or at least how I percieve it--the original<br/>
question was if the samurai had a rank structure<br/>
equivalent to that of the US military. The answer is<br/>
NO. <br/>
<br/>
 Would you agree to the phrase,<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> > for instance, that <br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Yes, but I wouldn't say that "taisho" is a higher RANK<br/>
than "ashigaru". Again, the difference between "rank"<br/>
and "ranking". <br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> > I do. But then again, I think that your personal<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>The original poster specifically asked if there was a<br/>
correlation to the modern military rank structure, and<br/>
specifically mentioned US military ranks. There's no<br/>
other way to answer his/her question--the answer is<br/>
no. While there was obviously gradation in the<br/>
importance of jobs, etc., there were no military<br/>
ranks. Pure and simple. You can't even use<br/>
translations of the words the Japanese used, because<br/>
as has been said, General (Taisho) A may command 300<br/>
troops, whereas General B commands 30,000. <br/>
 <br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> > Absolutely agreed - believe me. However, the round<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>In the context of the question, yes it is. If we were<br/>
talking social rank, or "importance", then yes, that<br/>
changes things. But the poster asked if there were<br/>
military ranks ala the modern system. The answer is<br/>
no. While a taisho may "outrank" an ashigaru, that<br/>
makes neither "taisho" or "ashigaru" a rank. If you're<br/>
an assembly line worker, someone in corporate<br/>
management obviously "outranks" you in the context of<br/>
your company. However, your "rank" isn't Factory<br/>
Worker, and his isn't "Middle Manager". Those are<br/>
jobs--one is "higher" than the other, but they aren't<br/>
ranks. <br/>

<br/>
I agree with this in the main - but I think the definition being <br/>
used of 'rank' here is a bit too narrow. I personally am not trying <br/>
to identify a US Army-style  'rank and progression' system in the <br/>
sengoku era.<br/>
<br/>
>There's no rule. In any feudally structured army, ALL positions and duties are<br/>

<br/>
Of course. But look again at how I structured my sentance. "It seems <br/>
to me that once 'promoted' to ashigaru-gashira a person would not go <br/>
back to being a plain ashigaru." I would be very interested in <br/>
learning about any cases where it did happen.<br/>
<br/>
> There is no way to say "I'm a<br/>

Totally agree. Of course I would agree, since I in no way implied in <br/>
the first place that I though any such notion might exist.<br/>

<br/>
I have no idea where these references to 'rights' and courts martial <br/>
are coming from. I hope not in reaction to anything that I wrote.<br/>

chef nor busboy are ranks. They are jobs and positions. The chef is, however,<br/>
very important and gets to tell people what to do. And busboys are low-boy on<br/>
the totem pole. It's like saying "would you agree that the king outranks a<br/>

about a feudal Japanese army. Or, rather, when the term is used, I try to keep<br/>
it clearly a socio-political reference, or something implying that someone HAS<br/>
(as in "a taisho outranks the common footsoldier") but avoid using terms that<br/>
imply a person HOLDS rank.<br/>

("Honda Tadakatsu was one of Ieyasu's most trusted lieutenants.... Tadakatsu was <br/>
a valiant captain.... As a general, Tadakatsu was fearless and totally <br/>
reliable...."). Note that all of these uses are occupational (job terms), as <br/>
while I can say "the general, Tadakatsu" but not once could I say "General <br/>
Tadakatsu." It either removes the idea of rank right away, or confuses the hell <br/>
out of people who don't get it.<br/>

memory is not very good.  There was an excellent website I found in <br/>
Japanese that covers the entire court ranking system right down to <br/>
samanosuke and -no kami ranks, but I dont remember the URL.  LTDomer <br/>
has it, I hope, because last time he forgot it, I sent it to him...  <br/>
On that topic of ranks, I remember watching a history show a while <br/>
ago that said that the reason that Hideyoshi went after "Kampaku" <br/>
rather than "shogun" had nothing to do with his own genealogy and <br/>
thus "worthiness" of the shogun rank (When you are tenkabito, you can <br/>
invent whatever genealogy necesary to become shogun), but simply <br/>
because Kampaku "outranks" shogun, and Hideyoshi, who has always been <br/>
a dreamer and a romantic, wanted to shoot for the highest position <br/>
possible, rather than the 4th ranked "seiitaishogun" - I might be <br/>
getting my facts here mixed a bit, but that was the general idea, <br/>
anyway.<br/>

Yes I see that you are right. The original poster did specifically ask <br/>
the question about ranks in the context of how they would relate to <br/>
modern US military rank. Point ceded.<br/>

Here, though, I must defend myself. I was trying to bring some <br/>
harmony to the discussion to find points where we could easily <br/>
agree<br/>
<br/>
I still do feel that it is a fair thing to say that there were <br/>
'ranks' in the more generic sense that I was using - which admittedly <br/>
is is different from the sense that the OP asked the question. <br/>

<h3>Question arising from &quot;did the samurai have military rankings?&quot;</h3>
by <i>deanwayland</i>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1726216997">Hi Folks,<br/>
<br/>
I must say that I really enjoyed my download this morning, nice thread,<br/>
nicely discussed, not to mention illuminating, and it's left me with a<br/>
question to which I hope you folks can provide an answer:<br/>
<br/>
Imagine a hypothetical Daimyo, "Lord X", who needs to organise his army.<br/>
What roles does he need to create and what are their titles? Can anyone<br/>
either point me to a site, or provide me with a list of the various jobs<br/>
etc.<br/>
<br/>
Also, what do these various titles literally mean, for example, the word<br/>
taichou, was translated in to "group-chief", assuming the kanji is the<br/>
same, does this mean that taisho means something like "group-something<br/>
else" and if so what?<br/>
<br/>
Likewise, it appeared that kashira and taichou were different words for<br/>
the same job. Is this simply a function of the era/region/fashion/taste<br/>
of the army using the title, or was there another subtlety at play?<br/>
<br/>
Okay to summarise then, as I understand it ALL sengoku armies (more or<br/>
less):<br/>
<br/>
1) have the same range of required "appointments" within its structure,<br/>
regardless of it's relative size when compared to another lord's army.<br/>
<br/>
2) thus there is no difference what so ever, to the titles used within<br/>
that army, as they merely describe the various tasks being undertaken by<br/>
the "appointees".<br/>
<br/>
3) any prestige accrues to these appointees from either:<br/>
<br/>
(a) the comparative social standing of one army when compared to<br/>
another, or<br/>
<br/>
(b) as a function of the perceived quality/value of some but not all<br/>
appointments within their own army, for example the kudos of being<br/>
appointed as a messenger within the Takeda forces.<br/>
<br/>
The sorts of jobs that occurred to me included:<br/>
<br/>
1) army overall "manager", if not the lord himself.<br/>
2) sub-contingent managers, probably defined by inter-personal<br/>
relationship with the lord.<br/>
3) large sub-unit manager's, probably defined by function, i.e. units of<br/>
cavalry or infantry (bushi or ashigaru)<br/>
4) smaller sub-unit managers, either as part of a larger one or<br/>
fulfilling a specialist role, messengers, artillery or HQ guards etc.<br/>
<br/>
Apart from the main function divisions of cavalry, spearman, gunners and<br/>
archers, the task type roles would include:<br/>
<br/>
1) support personnel such as porters, pack horse and cart handlers,<br/>
doctors/vets, pages/servants, cooks and other artisans/craftsmen. <br/>
<br/>
2) specialists: such as artillery crews, siege engineers and sailors.<br/>
<br/>
3) communications roles such as messengers, flag bearers (various<br/>
banners/standards), drummers, conch players etc. <br/>
<br/>
Plus sandal bearers, kitchen sink bearers... You get the idea.<br/>
<br/>
Well I think that's enough of that, cheer's for now.<br/>
<br/>
Dean<br/>

Now if we could only get Tarantino to direct, and<br/>

by <i>thomas5403</i>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1773571736">OK this is the way I see it, and we can split the boxoffice:<br/>
<br/>
Snoop Dog plays Kenshin, 50 cent plays Shingen, and the <br/>
highlight of the movie is 4th Kawanakajima, as the Kai Posse <br/>
put the moves on Mt Saijo, Kenshin and his homies jump into <br/>
the stretch limo and tear off round the mountain - cue car chase - <br/>
the advantage of a stretch is that at least half a dozen <br/>
archers can fire from the sunroofs.<br/>
<br/>
Then the final confrontation between Snoop and 50 at Shingen's <br/>
honjin. You can write your own dialogue ...<br/>

the stretch limo and tear off round the mountain - cue car chase - <br/>
the advantage of a stretch is that at least half a dozen <br/>
archers can fire from the sunroofs.<br/>
<br/>
Then the final confrontation between Snoop and 50 at Shingen's <br/>
honjin. You can write your own dialogue ...<br/>
<br/>
Think about it guys, we could be rich!<br/>

You're young, so rather than go off like this made me<br/>
want to do, I'll just explain some things:<br/>
<br/>
1. Owning land has nothing to do with your race and or<br/>
nationality. If I managed to make it through the<br/>
convoluted laws and buy a piece of land here in Tokyo,<br/>
that still does not make me Japanese. <br/>
<br/>
2. "Japanese" is a race as well as a nationality.<br/>
Japanese are not "WHITE", otherwise known as<br/>
Caucasian. They are Japanese. If you want something<br/>
more general, you could say Asian, but Japanese are<br/>
distinct racially from other Asian groups.<br/>
<br/>
3. The whole Snoop Dogg thing--IT'S A JOKE! No one is<br/>
serious about it.<br/>
<br/>

 <br/>
1.I never knew Japanese is a race.If I heard this from my friends at school I would have not believed them.But since you are from Japan are have immense experience and you are my friends I trust you.<br/>
 <br/>
2.Good for you to have a piece of land in Tokyo.I envy you for this.<br/>

Now do you see why the thought of Tom Cruise as<br/>
