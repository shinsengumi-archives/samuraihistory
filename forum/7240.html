<h3>Help Request on a book</h3>
by <i>projectdirector</i>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1502595100">Hello everyone,<br/>
I was able to pick up a book fairly cheap, but I 'seem' to remember <br/>
that this book was discussed in the group, however I cannot remember <br/>
what was written about it, nor can I find post that discuss it.<br/>
<br/>
The name of the book is <br/>
"Secrets of the Samurai, The martial Arts of Feudal Japan" <br/>
by Oscar Ratti and Adele Westbrook.<br/>
<br/>
Thank you for your help.<br/>

book, it couldn't have been good.</div>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-144945021">The book is not that bad.  The title is a bit misleading,  Luckily it's <br/>
not a mystic arts or ninja book more of a long drawn out thesis on <br/>
samurai history and weapons.   A good beginner book on the samurai but <br/>
not one of the greatest books I have ever read.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Summary evaluation: don't trust the pictures, and double-check the <br/>
contents of the text in other sources before accepting them as facts.<br/>
<br/>
I think it works better as a source of inspiration for fantasy games or <br/>
fiction with a pseudo-samurai flavour than as an actual history book.<br/>
