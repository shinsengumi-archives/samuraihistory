<h3>squad-level tactics</h3>
by <i>takeda_katsuchiyo</i>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-532839586">Hey all.  This is a legit question to any and all scholars out there<br/>
with access to the right sources.  <br/>
<br/>
I was researching over in the university library and there is a<br/>
notable lack of english sources concerning japanese tactics on a<br/>
squad-based level in sengoku and muromachi feudal combat.  One I came<br/>
across giving brief information on the matter was "Samurai, Warfare<br/>
and the State in Early Medieval Japan (Warfare and History)" by Karl<br/>
F. Friday, his newest book.  It concerns earlier medieval warfare and,<br/>
to be realistic, only revealed minimal on the subject (as there are<br/>
probably little surviving primary sources to draw from).  <br/>
<br/>
I got the basic impression that, like many other medieval combat<br/>
affairs, an army's maneovering capabilities were not as impressive as<br/>
may be assumed.  When, if at all, combat was joined, samurai moved on<br/>
a squad level, rather independent and not too unlike their european<br/>
knight-errant counterparts.  It was so, according to Friday, because<br/>
this small squad would most likely be the same samurai who they<br/>
locally trained with and thus knew most intimately in terms of<br/>
tactical capabilities.  I was wondering if anyone else has access to<br/>
sources going in-depth on this topic, and if they could briefly<br/>
describe their impressions on the subject.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks</div>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-651071282"><blockquote><span title="ireply">> I've also read Karl Friday's book and found it quite informative. <br/>
 </span></blockquote>Another book which gives a very good idea of the mediaeval society in <br/>
which the warfare was waged, and the social and political background, <br/>
is The World Turned Upside Down by Pierre Francois Souyri (London <br/>
Pimlico 2002) (v. good bibliography, not all in French!)<br/>
<br/>
Does anyone else have any opinions on these books?<br/>
