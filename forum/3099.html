<h3>Shimazu Clan</h3>
by <i>madbearscave</i>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-941666219">Hi,<br/>
<br/>
My name is Jake. This is my first time with this email<br/>
group and I thought I would take a breif momnet to say<br/>
hi to all the other members.<br/>
<br/>
Now on to my question. I have a intrest in the Shimazu<br/>
Clan of Satsuma province. I was told that Satsuma<br/>
produced some of the most fearsome No-dachi samurai.<br/>
Is there any truth to this.<br/>
<br/>
Also were the Shimazu invovled in putting down the<br/>
Shimabara Reblion of 1637-1638.<br/>
<br/>
Any help on these questions will be greatly<br/>
appreaciated as well as any other information<br/>
regarding the Shimazu.<br/>
<br/>
Note: I have read the article on Shimazu Yoshihisa and<br/>
Iriki-In Shigetomo.<br/>
<br/>
Thank you,<br/>
<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1413960541">Actually, I'd like to know a bit about Satsuma region as well for personal reasons. My name is Robert Omura. My grandfather was Kenji Omura who came from the Kagoshima region of Japan and came to Canada in the early 20th C. He was the eldest son of a samurai family. I never knew my grandfather as he died in an internment camp in British Columbia. Before WWII my grandfather held title to property from Vancouver to Montreal, but these were confiscated and sold to Veterans Affairs during the war. My father, who was born in Canada, inherited his estate years ago, and was contacted in the late 1970's by his cousin there and, because he had never been to Japan, he transferred title to the lands to his cousin. These were in the Kagoshima area. I understand that he was adopted to the Watabe family as a child, but changed his name back to Omura. I am told that my great-grandfather was asked to move to the capital to run the Japanese tax system -- late Meiji period, but refused. I also<br/>
 understand that the records are largely complete in Kagoshima, having been largely spared by the war. Any hints or suggestions on tracking more information would be greatly appreciated.<br/>

<h3>Re: [samuraihistory] Shimazu Clan</h3>
by <i>madbearscave</i>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-626203589">Hi Rob,<br/>
<br/>
I have been able to find some information on the<br/>
Satsuma region and the Shimazu clan. Pretty much the<br/>
two are very much intertwined and your ancestors were<br/>
once retainers to the Shimazu. The Kyushu Samurai was<br/>
a very fearsome, brave and honorable warrior. Notable<br/>
examples being the Shimazu of Satsuma, the Ryuzoji and<br/>
Nabeshima of Hizen.<br/>
<br/>
The Satsuma samurai proved themselves in battles<br/>
across Kyushu, Korea and Sekigahara. At Sekigahara the<br/>
Satsuma samurai were on the Toyotomi side. Though<br/>
defeated their Daimyo, Shimazu Yoshihiro ordered a<br/>
charge straight through the enemy center. Breaking<br/>
through the Satsuma Samurai were able to retreat and<br/>
make it back to Kyushu. Observing this the Tokugawa<br/>
generals were dumbfounded. Tokugawa Ieyasu just shook<br/>
his head and said "only a Satsuma samurai would<br/>
retreat by attacking and that they may have lost the<br/>
battle but not their courage". This would later be<br/>
known as Shimazu no nokiguchi or Shimazu style<br/>
retreat.<br/>
<br/>
There are many examples of their courge and tenacity<br/>
in the face of ovewhelming odds. Being defeated only<br/>
by Toyotomi Hideyoshi in 1587 and Tokugawa Ieyasu in<br/>
1600. Each time the Satsuma samurai impressed their<br/>
enemies greatly with their courage and honor.<br/>
<br/>
Suggested research: Shimazu Takahisa, Shimazu<br/>
Yoshihisa, Shimazu Yoshihiro, and Shimazu Iehisa<br/>
<br/>
also notable vassal families: Iriki-in, Togo, Niiro,<br/>
Ijuin, Hongo, Kiire, Hirada, Machida, Uwai,<br/>
Tamegashima, Kawakami, Kimotsuki, Honda<br/>
<br/>
There is alot more info out there and I have only<br/>
scratched the surface. I hope I was of some help.<br/>
<br/>
Good luck in your research and please share anything<br/>
you find. I'll be more than happy to share what I<br/>
discover.<br/>
<br/>
One day I wouldn't mind sharing my Grandfathers story.<br/>
But not today.<br/>
<br/>
Well I've babbled enough.<br/>

<h3>Re: [samuraihistory] Shimazu Clan</h3>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-264288335">Hi Jake,<br/>
 <br/>
The Satsuma Samurai have long been recognised as the most fearsome and courageous<br/>
samurai of Japan.They came from Satsuma and they were the first Japanese people to copy the arquebuses from the Portuguese.They had very good swords and they were excellent fighters.They were used sometimes as shock troops to penetrate the enemy center.After the enemy was demoralised and shocked,the Shimazu would bring the other infantry divisions and destroy the enemy unit.This is what I know.<br/>
