       I wasn't trying to be offensive, but the other post gave me a chuckle, <br/>
and it was something that I personally had been wondering about for a while <br/>
anyway.  The "department... &c." was in reference to my own question, not <br/>
yours.  Sorry for the misunderstanding and for offending you if I did.  Please <br/>
accept my humble apologies.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1805024276">No offense taken, I was just trying to be a little bit<br/>
more specific on the hairstyle since it seemed like<br/>
there was some question as to which one i was speaking<br/>
of.<br/>
<br/>
So does anyone have an answer?  I seriously tried<br/>
putting my hair up like that and every time I did it<br/>
just fell all over the place.  No I need to put gobs<br/>
of baby oil in it or what?<br/>
