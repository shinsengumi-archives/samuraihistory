The path to becoming an honorable person is a tough one. I tend towards <br/>
western believes of good, evil and guilt and I do not find the concept <br/>
of face as practiced by Japan to be honorable. I.E. if no one saw the <br/>
evil deed then nothing happened.<br/>
<br/>
The code of Bushido evolved after the bloody civil wars that united <br/>
Japan. It was a method to stop the underlings from thinking about <br/>
revolting against their superiors.<br/>
<br/>
I will once again bow to my western roots and state that I find the <br/>
western concept of chivalric knight to be much more honorable.<br/>

The books and topics recommended are all good ones, get thee to a library!<br/>
