<br/>
Ayumi Sato presented her documentary "Manjiro," the castaway who <br/>
trailblazed a relationship between the United States and Japan.<br/>
<br/>
Sato, a documentary filmmaker who lives in Boston, was invited by <br/>
the Japan American Society of Arkansas to show "Majiro" on Friday in <br/>
Mullins Library. <br/>
<br/>
Manjiro was the first Japanese person to land in the United States. <br/>
More specifically, he was the first to be rescued and brought to the <br/>
United States. This year marks the 150-year anniversary of Manjiro's <br/>
landing and the subsequent beginning of relations between Japan and <br/>
the United States.<br/>
<br/>
The documentary examines Manjiro's life, as well as the political <br/>
and social background of the drama between the newly opened Japanese <br/>
state under the Tokugawa Shogunate and the United States under <br/>
Admiral Perry. <br/>
<br/>
Manjiro was an instrumental translator in the treaty that opened <br/>
trade between Japan and the United States and the West. <br/>
<br/>
One of his most significant accomplishments was the translation of <br/>
navigation texts, used by Americans in the nineteenth century, into <br/>
Japanese. The translation took four years to complete, and secured a <br/>
place in Japanese society for illiterate farmers-turned-fishermen. <br/>
<br/>
The trailblazing of a relationship between Japan and the United <br/>
States gave Manjiro a place in the history that might have been <br/>
forgotten, were it not brought to life through Sato's documentary. <br/>
<br/>
Manjiro earned a position of respect in the Japanese government, <br/>
translating and teaching English.<br/>
<br/>
Sato captured the essence of Manjiro's life by explaining his story <br/>
through video, documents, experts and footage of locations Manjiro <br/>
visited. <br/>
<br/>
"I really like being behind the camera, instead of in front of it," <br/>
Sato said. Sato explained how she became a filmmaker after changing <br/>
her career from broadcast journalism. <br/>
<br/>
Sato lives in the Boston area and expects to continue to produce <br/>
documentaries. Manjiro took two years and three months to complete <br/>
and cost approximately $15,000. This film is the Sato's second and <br/>
most widely distributed documentary, and was brought to the UA by <br/>
the Japan America Society of Arkansas. <br/>
<br/>
The documentary was part of the Asian Studies week, "From Silk Roads <br/>
to Crossroads."</div>
