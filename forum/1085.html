<br/>
I could, join in this debate on mr Turnbull, but I think I will try <br/>
and avoid this and try and be helpful instead.  I have found some <br/>
excellent pictures of samurai banners. Maybe some have found it, but <br/>
maybe some have not. It is of interest to anyone who likes Heraldry <br/>
or mon. Perhaps also to people who research Japanese prefectures. The <br/>
links are <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.crwflags.com/fotw/flags/jp-kuni.html">http://www.crwflags.com/fotw/flags/jp-kuni.html</a> <br/>
also <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.crwflags.com/fotw/flags/geo-jp.html">http://www.crwflags.com/fotw/flags/geo-jp.html</a> -shows a good map <br/>
of Japan.  In general this is a good base for further research.  I am <br/>
starting a website soon, among the topics I want to look into, will <br/>
be Japanese prefectures, from Heian to modern day. Mainly <br/>
concentrating on old maps from adventurers, looking at English <br/>
spellings etc. My goal is one time to have a map of Japan I am happy <br/>
with for each date in time. If anyone knows of good maps, I would <br/>
appreciate a shout, one site I like is <br/>

just type Japan for search topic, you will be rewarded by excellent <br/>
maps, takes a while though. <br/>
Ok then hope this helps.<br/>
Turnbull is not the best in his field, but I suppose until as Kitsuno <br/>
says the West catches up with Japanese historians, he is at least <br/>
keeping the subject accesible to people, the problem lies in if by <br/>
doing this people get the wrong view of the Bushi, I believe it is a <br/>
matter of compromise, I guess, that if we want to read popular quite <br/>
easy to read books, we will continue to buy each book as it comes <br/>
out.  If we want scholarly books to use for study then I guess the <br/>
advice is like others have said look to Japanese sources, or to the <br/>
past although there are also some other good Western writers.  Oh <br/>
well Im not sure, we can't have the best of both worlds. <br/>
<br/>
hmmm, can we?<br/>
<br/>
all the best<br/>
