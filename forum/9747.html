-I googled and I got answers--<br/>
<br/>
1- Yuya Shiina could indeed have possessed a triple rotating barrel <br/>
flintlock pistol in 1604 and no she would not be breaking Shogunate <br/>
Japanese Law at that time since NobuNaga did not outlaw foreigners <br/>
and firearms until he had used rifles to win the great war and unite <br/>
the Samurai clans together in 1615. <br/>
<br/>
2- Such a pistol did indeed exist in 1604. <br/>

I recall an offer for a duck's foot flintlock kit on the back of a <br/>
comic book when I was a kid (I'm 58 going on 59) and it sold for <br/>
$4.98 + s/h. And that self same weapon (exact) was featured in Geena <br/>
Davis's film 'Cutthroat Island' which is where Depp's 'Pirates' <br/>
trilogy drew a lot of its stuff from. <br/>
<br/>
Comments? Thanks for all the help and interest in Japanese history <br/>
gang. SFN/SYS and Kami bless ya all. Toodles-K&K<br/>
