<div id="ygrps-yiv-155307281">We've been working for about a month on getting the new Samurai<br/>
Archives wiki ready (Known as the SamuraiWiki) - and I'm putting it<br/>

We really need editors to get in there and start adding content. We<br/>
already have hundreds of entries, but since the intent is to make this<br/>
the most concise and detailed Wiki on pre-20th century Japan, we'll<br/>
need plenty of help.  Check the "current events" page for a list of<br/>

This is the same software that Wikipedia uses, so the potential for a<br/>
