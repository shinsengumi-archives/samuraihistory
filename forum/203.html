<div id="ygrps-yiv-2128066757">Regarding the Lone wolf and cub question...<br/>
Accuracy? I believe that apart from the obvious problems (Ura-Yagyu? And the <br/>
whole corruption theme.) that L.W.and C. is one of the best Samurai era manga <br/>
series out there ( If you like Lone wolf then also check out Blade of the <br/>
Immortal, Dark Horse pub.) The films themselves were close enough to the <br/>
comic to allow me to get into them easily (Not Shogun Assassin...the original <br/>
storyline...) and were as much fun to watch. The comics are still the best <br/>
drawn and have the most original and well thought out storyline that I have <br/>
read yet, although 'Blade' may come close to it.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-774094583">The films lack alot of the depth found in the original comics. The comics<br/>
are historically accurate, but they are of course comics so...The writer<br/>
Koike Kazuo put in a lot of research before writing his works. Many of the<br/>
best stories and most interesting historical info were never translated in<br/>
the English editions.<br/>
    I love the series, it is an excellent window on the ideals of the time<br/>
and how we percieve what is just and unjust today.<br/>
    I reccomend Kubikiri Asa, the stories are shorter and self contained and<br/>
very easy to follow even if one doesn't read Japanese.<br/>

Tomoe Gozen<br/>
<br/>
Daughter of Nakahara Kaneto and sister of Imai Kanehira. She married Kiso<br/>
Yoshinaka and was remarkable for her beauty and courage. She followed her<br/>
husband in all his battles, herself leading a troop of men. When Yoshinaka<br/>
was defeated at Uji (1184), he had only 13 samurai with him and Tomoe was<br/>
with them. A certain Uchida Ieyoshi,  of Herculean strength,  came to attack<br/>
her, but Tomoe defeated him and cut of his head. After Yoshinakas death she<br/>
retired to Tomosugi (Echigo). Swas 28 years old.</div>

<br/>
<br/>
Tomoe Gozen<br/>
<br/>
Tomoe Gozen is one of the few examples of a female samurai warrior in <br/>
Japanese history. More than simply a defender of the homestead in time <br/>
of necessity, she is described as a warrior of peerless skill, going <br/>
into battle like a man. She was either the wife of Minamoto Yoshinaka, <br/>
or by some sources a female attendant, but in either case is described <br/>
as one of Yoshinaka's senior captains. Yoshinaka was one of the Minamoto <br/>
lords who fought against the Taira in the Gempei War, and after the <br/>
Minomoto victory at Kurikawa in 1084 placed Kyoto in Minamoto hands, <br/>
Yoshinaka felt that he should become the overall leader of the clan.<br/>
<br/>
Yoshinaka's feeling was contested by Minamoto Yoritomo. Yorimoto's <br/>
forces attacked Yoshinkaka and Gozen at Awazu, and despite putting up a <br/>
tremendous fight, their forces were overwhelmed. With only a handful of <br/>
warriors standing, Yoshinaka ordered his wife to flee the field rather <br/>
than face capture and death. Accounts vary of what followed. Some say <br/>
that Gozen stayed and died with her husband, while others state that she <br/>
fled the battlefield. In the latter instance, there is further <br/>
uncertainty. Most accounts state that she fled with a severed head, but <br/>
again sources vary between claiming that she took the head of an enemy <br/>
soldier named Onda no Hachiro Moroshige, or that of her husband taken to <br/>
keep him from capture. A final debate surrounds the fate of Gozen after <br/>
her escape, as some state that she cast herself into the sea with her <br/>
husband's head, while others assert that she became a nun.<br/>

A shaku is almost *exactly* a foot. In fact, it's 11.93 inches. There are ten sun in a shaku, each about 1.19 inches. A bu is 3 milimeters... a miniscule length.<br/>

Japanese Unit Conversions **<br/>

1 shaku = 11.93054 inches (30.30 cm)<br/>
 <br/>
1 shaku = 10 sun<br/>
1 sun = 1.19305 inches (3.03 cm)<br/>

1 sun = 10 bu<br/>
1 bu = 0.11931 inches (0.303 cm)<br/>

1 bu = 10 rin<br/>

a shaku is about 1 and 1/2 feet.. a bu is half of that and I think it<br/>
keeps decreasing by half in that order..  to find out, you might try<br/>
looking up iaido or kenjutsu.. that is where I saw refference to them,<br/>
but I do not remember the specifics on them.. after a certain time<br/>
period, katanas were restricted and could not have a blade longer than<br/>
two shaku.. if you read about the 47 Ronin, when they made their attack,<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-429023031">A shaku is within an eighth of an inch of an english foot. A bu is one<br/>
tenth of a shaku. A sun is one tenth of a bu. A rin is one tenth of a<br/>
sun. This is really like the metric system. Reference to this is given on<br/>
a poster made by Hawley publications. This poster may be available at<br/>
www.ecmas.com. <br/>
Further, on the ninja subject. Think of ninja like hitmen. Do you go to<br/>
hitman school? Do people  generally know who hitmen are? On this line of<br/>
reasoning if a sixteenth century ninja (hitman) had a gun with a silencer<br/>
wouldn't he use it without regard to tradition, etc?<br/>
Really enjoy reading everything submitted by the group.<br/>

Think of the shakuhachi; it's called that because it's 1 shaku 8 sun long.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-318459037">Greetings,<br/>
  I was watching the mini-documentary put together by The History Channel for the "Last Samurai" last night. Apparently when Perry came in and opened up with Cannon Fire in the Harbor, the Emperor took notice, as did everyone in Edo. The general gist is they figured there was no way to avoid the changes around them and they better catch up to protect themselves. This meant going from "Warrior to Soldier" as it was put. But it also impacted them culturally with the Western styles and traditions coming into play. It opened up more "freedom" but much was lost along the way.<br/>
   <br/>
  The system in place (feudal, Hierarchy) in my opinion is a natural and stable point for humans. It has worked for thousands of years in every part of the world and only in the last 500 years has "Democracy" come en-vogue'. Even then, the Emperor still ruled, but the Council moved the country to a more European style because the saw some good to the people in some of the ways of the foreigners. <br/>
   <br/>
  The discipline was there on a personal/clan level, but the country as a whole was not united and I think this was another reason for the changes. "Divided we Fall" seems to be a definite issue on the mind of the ruling class. <br/>
   <br/>
  All in all, I think they could have made a certain amount of a western move without destroying the system or the Samurai, but the external influences to me proved to overwhelming to do so. It was easier to give in.<br/>
   <br/>
  I am sure there is much more to add that I have missed, but I am still in the early stages of study. I am open to correction and addition. The whole point of a group like this is to learn...<br/>

<h3>correcting some historical misconceptions</h3>
by <i>sinegalm</i>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-949610421">I’m no expert in Japan history, but I’ve noticed quite a few historical inaccuracies posted on this list recently. This is my attempt to respond to these comments and questions. I thought it might be helpful if I posted some comments, and some history books for people to read, for those who might be interested. <br/>
 <br/>
First, a correction on Tokugawa history. When Matthew Perry (that’s Commodore Perry, not Chandler of “Friends”) arrived in his proverbial black ships in 1853 and 1854, Japan was ruled under the Tokugawa shogunate, not the emperor. The emperor, living in Kyoto, was barely more than a powerless figurehead. The shoguns in Tokyo, and their deputies, the kanrei and the associated bureaucrats ran the show. The emperor was generally just a rubber-stamper. In fact, (with the exception of two minor short-lived restoration incidents in 1221 and 1333) the emperor in Japan held very little direct political power for almost the entire millenium. Ever since the Yoritomo Minamoto took the reigns as the first shogun around 1185, and established his camp at Kamakura, the emperor became a figurehead. Lip service was paid to the emperor as the big cheese, but everyone knew the emperor had little to do with actual power.  (For an account of how Yoritomo established the first shogunate, see Jeffrey Mass’s “Yoritomo and the founding of the first bakufu”.) <br/>
<br/>
With the arrival of Perry, pressure was massive to reform, and the Tokugawa shogunate took the heat. A movement began to restore the emperor to power. That emperor was Meiji, and as the emperor in Japan had not really ruled for 800 plus years, the Meiji restoration was a historical event in Japan of major import. Out with the shoguns and in with the emperor. For the story on how the last shogun got kicked out, read Shiba Ryotaro’s “the Last Shogun”, a historical account of the last Tokugawa shogun, Tokugawa Yoshinobu.<br/>
<br/>
The rights and privileges of samurai legally enshrined in law were gradually removed and eliminated in the Meiji period. And eventually the samurai class was kaput.  And many of those who had strongly pushed for the restoration of the emperor were distraught when Meiji implemented such dramatic reforms ending the privileges of the samurai. One such individual was Saigo Takamori. In Mark Ravina’s bio of the man, you can read about how he first fought for the Meiji restoration, then regretted what he had done, and rebelled against Meiji with a band of followers. The Tom Cruise movie "the Last Samurai" is a wildly inaccurate recreation of the life of Saigo Takamori.<br/>
<br/>
I would also disagree with my friend who, in response to a question about why so few comments on the Meiji era, suggested that the Meiji era was not so interesting as prior periods of Japan history. The Meiji era is absolutely fascinating. A country which the Tokugawa attempted to (mostly) legally close to outside influence and contact, after the Meiji restoration, went the exact opposite way and became like a sponge of learning and acquiring the technological know-how of the Europe and North America, and in short order turned itself into a major power capable of kicking Russian arse in the Russo-Japan war of 1904-05. I would suggest instead that the reason that there are so few comments about Meiji era on this “samurai history” list is because the samurai class became defunct during the Meiji era.<br/>
<br/>
Other books I would highly recommend: Lamers bio of Oda Nobunaga, “Japonius Tyrannus”. Mary Elizabeth Berry’s “Hideyoshi”. Donald Keene’s “Yoshimasa and the Silver Pavillon”. Berry's book on Hideyoshi is particularly fascinating. I give it five stars.<br/>
<br/>
Other historical tidbits: many in the warrior class in Japan, particularly in the Ashikaga periods and the Sengoku periods, practiced wakashudo&#33509;&#34886;&#36947;, in which an adult warrior or daimyo kept a boy-lover. It was also known as nanshoku 男色. Not all daimyo or samurai did this, but a lot of very prominent leaders did so, including macho tough guys, Nobunaga and Ashikaga Yoshimitsu and Minamoto Yoshitomo. The practice in Japan was very similar to the practice in ancient Greece where the older adult male was meant to be a sort of general mentor to his boy. The practice in pre-modern and early modern Japan was very different from what we would consider normal homosexuality today. In modern terms this type of sexual behavior seems very unethical, and predatory, but it was very common for a thousand years in Japan until the middle of the Tokugawa period. So much for samurai never doing anything dishonorable. Here are a few websites with more info.<br/>

Another set of historical tidbits: Christianity in Japan, and the brutal persecution and torture of the Christians by the Tokugawa shogunate. So much AGAIN for samurai never doing anything dishonorable. The history of the Jesuits in Japan, and then the abolition and persecution of Christianity is a fascinating, albeit morbid subject. Even more interesting is the story of the kakure kirishitan, the hidden Christians. Check out the following sites, and also, Endo Shusaku's fantastic historical novel "Silence"沈黙, about the Jesuit priests who were tortured and renounced Christianity under torture of the dreaded hanging pit, &#31348;&#21514;&#12426;.<br/>

If anyone sees any errors in any of my comments, please feel free to correct me, because, as I said, I am not an expert on Japan history, just an amateur lover of Japan history. I hope these comments were of interest and useful to some.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1167838324">If a bushi (samurai or ronin) were to attempt to take another bushi's wife, the wife would be expected to defend herself or else commit jigai (the woman's version of seppuku) before she would be taken. Women of the bushi class regularly carried a knife; in many clans, she also received martial arts/self-defense training. <br/>
