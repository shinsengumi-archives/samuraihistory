<div id="ygrps-yiv-1443853979">This is always a fascinating subject.  I recall reading there was a long<br/>
transition period from bronze to iron swords.  Many believed bronze swords could<br/>
take a sharper cutting edge and so they maintained an edge over iron swords for<br/>
quite some centuries.  There is a much longer story to this that I could dig out<br/>
if list denizens want to follow up...<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Generally, that's spot on. Some of the earliest blades unearthed were of iron, <br/>
although many bronze spear-heads and similar items of bronze were found in <br/>
Japanese tumuli. There were a few bronze swords as well, but they don't seem to <br/>
be in the majority in the early period.<br/>
