<div id="ygrps-yiv-761197179">I personaly disagree that Knights were more honorable.  I am not <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-2061467265">Hey there.<br/>
  It may just be my take, and I may be wrong, but it's really a matter of <br/>
perspective.  From the point of the Crusaders and those sending them -- at <br/>
least the ones with the power -- they were definitely honourable.  However, <br/>
it must not go unsaid that there were probably people with cooler heads that <br/>
definitely disagreed with them, which, in 20-20 retrospect, would have been a <br/>
Good Thing.  (Genocide is ALWAYS a Bad Thing anyway, but that goes without <br/>
saying.)  If news of such atrocities had reached Japan, the Crusades and <br/>
Crusaders, rightly, probably would have been seen as barbaric and inhuman.<br/>
  Conversely, the warriors in Japan -- both the Samurai and the peasant <br/>
soldiers used by generals such as ODA Nobunaga -- were acting in ways that <br/>
THEY deemed honourable, and in the "more enlightened" west, were seen, if my <br/>
memoury serves me correctly, as "heathen savages."<br/>
  Anyway, that's my take.<br/>
<br/>

the Crusades, the general statement should not be applied to knights in <br/>
general.<br/>

In the end, knights and samurai had the same faults as anyone else, in spite <br/>
of their intentions simply because they were human and subject to all <br/>
influences that the rest of us are exposed to.<br/>

<h3>Re: [samuraihistory] Knights as more honorable</h3>
by <i>mijalo_kr</i>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1011904041">Few warriors, be they European knights, samurai, or<br/>
anyone from anywhere else, have been honourable (as we<br/>
would see it). Chivalry was an ideal as much concerned<br/>
with courtly love and Christian devotion as with<br/>
conduct in warfare. Much of samurai-based literature<br/>
was similarly focussed, upon ideals. 'Heike<br/>
Monogatari' extolls the virtues of usurping Taira<br/>
warrios and the rather rougher Minamoto from the more<br/>
rural east, and as Yoritomo shows he was as cutthroat<br/>
(pragmatic?) as anyone else. The whole machinery of<br/>
the Kamakura bakufu/Hojo regency collapsed fifty years<br/>
after the second (attempted) Mongol invasion, largely<br/>
due to the fact the samurai who served were not<br/>
handsomely regarded, since it was a defensive<br/>
campaign. Rspect goes hand-in-hand with rewards.<br/>
