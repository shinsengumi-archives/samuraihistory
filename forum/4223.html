 </span></blockquote>Not read... Isn't it a bit dumb to use as a title basically the same <br/>
Benedith used some 50 years ago?<br/>
My favorite books on the Japanese written by gaijin are Hearns' "An <br/>
Interpretation," and Kerr's "Dogs and Demons." Smith's "Japan: A <br/>
Reinterpretation" is very good in the chapters about education, and <br/>
Wolferen's "The Enigma of Japanese Power" has some good parts as well. <br/>
Avoid like smallpox Reischauer's "The Japanese Today." He was a good <br/>
historian, but as a social scientist he had an agenda, thou reading his <br/>
propaganda is a waste of time. I have been told Buruma's books are <br/>
great, but I haven't read them.<br/>

<br/>
Something is fishy. Given the name, especially. No one who knows about Japan or <br/>
has lived there for any length of time has NOT heard of Ruth Bennedict's book. <br/>
To use damn near the same title smacks of someone willing to accept (and hoping <br/>
for) some "accidental orders."<br/>
<br/>
Plus I have an innate distrust of any self-published book...<br/>
