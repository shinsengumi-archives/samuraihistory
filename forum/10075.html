<h3>Sengoku-jidai winter campaigning</h3>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1481630679">In pre-2oth century times in the West, it was common for armies to go<br/>
into winter quarters<br/>
in late Fall and then begin the next campaign season around April or so.<br/>
This was<br/>
escpecially followed in Classical warfare.  Did the Japanese follow this<br/>
same practice?? And if so, to what extent, and what were the protocols??<br/>
I know about the Osaka winter<br/>
campaign (1614-15), but I beleive that was somewhat of a rarity.<br/>
