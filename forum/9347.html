 </span></blockquote>Nobunaga did die at Honnouji in 1582, attacked by Akechi Mitsuhide (or<br/>
did he get out and live out the rest of his years in peace as a farmer<br/>
in Southern Kyushu where he eventually became Hideyori's gardener<br/>
after he escaped from Osaka castle? Hmm?).  As for the illustrious<br/>
Yagyu Juubei, I'm not sure off the top of my head, but I'm sure<br/>
someone here knows.</div>

 </span></blockquote>Yagyu Jubei Lived from around 1607-1650 as far as I know.  I think<br/>
there's little chance that they are one and the same, if that is what<br/>
is being implied.</div>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1445183119">I have heard many stories related to Nobunaga's death. However, I think it is most commonly believed that he died at Honnoji. Whether he committed seppuku or died from an arrow, or perished in the fire, I guess we have no way of knowing. There are several Japanese sites and articles related to different theories on this matter (from why Mitsuhide did it to what actually happened to Nobunaga). <br/>
<br/>
In a related matter... Can anyone tell me the exact location of the original Honnoji? I have been to the re-built site on several occassions, but it would be nice to see the landscape of where the original actually rested.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Actually, theres' a small marker in front of some<br/>
building--I thing it's a hotel--that marks the former<br/>
spot of the Honnoji. I've seen it on documentaries<br/>
about Nobunaga, but last time I was in Kyoto wasn't<br/>
able to find it myself. <br/>

<h3>location of original Honnoji, marker for Nobunaga&#39;s death</h3>
by <i>sinegalm</i>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1850130640">Regarding the marker for the site of Nobunaga's death, I walked out there<br/>
and found it when I was visiting Kyoto last March or April, on a weekend<br/>
visit. First, I made the mistake of going directly to the current Honnoji,<br/>
but was told that Honnoji had been relocated since Nobunaga's death. The guy<br/>
at the temple pointed me in the general direction to go, but I really didn't<br/>
know the exactly location. So with some difficulty, I eventually figured out<br/>
where the marker was located so I could hike out to find it. I found the<br/>
location by visiting a nearby museum of history that was very close to<br/>
Honnoji. The museum had historical maps and tourist maps for sale, and I<br/>
asked a woman at the museum information booth where the old Honnoji was.<br/>
Between the two of us, we searched one of the maps and we figured out where<br/>
the old Honnoji was. If I recall correctly, it was about a twenty minute<br/>
twenty-five minute walk from Honnoji. When I found it, the marker was pretty<br/>
non-descript. The marker was relatively modest grey stone, to my<br/>
recollection perhaps 70-80 centimeters tall, located in a very non-descript<br/>
residential neighborhood. The marker itself was located immediately in front<br/>
of the commercial office of a model house showroom and an elementary school.<br/>
The kids were laughing, playing, shouting in the background. I don't think<br/>
that I have a photo of it. I'm not much of a photography kind of guy.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Yep, that's what I remember seeing from TV. Next time<br/>
I'm in Kyoto maybe I'll go try again, but I doubt I'll<br/>
be in Kyoto again soon. <br/>

<h3>Re: location of original Honnoji, marker for Nobunaga&#39;s death</h3>
by <i>kurotatsunoshi</i>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1184712833">Here's the location of the original Honno-ji, courtesy of my wife Ayame who passes it on her way to work most days.<br/>
<br/>
Starting from the southeast corner of the Oike-dori and Horikawa-dori intersection (the big intersection at the southeast corner of Nijo castle), walk straight south down Horikawa-dori until you get to Rokkaku-dori (about three blocks or so-sometimes it is hard to count blocks because of alleys). Turn east (left if you are going south) and go to Aburanokoji-dori (two blocks or so). This is the northwest corner of the Honno-ji site. It is a four block area bounded by Rokkaku-dori on the north, Nishikinokoji-dori on the south, Aburanokoji-dori on the west, and Nishinotoin-dori on the east. The building with the marker is located on a corner and has a brick first story with a metal upper portion.</div>
