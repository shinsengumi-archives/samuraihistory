<br/>
Remember that the figures you see illustrated on the web site for EoI<br/>
figures are for the "Toy Collector" market.  The process in painting these<br/>
is to have a "period expert" paint a master which is then replicated by the<br/>
chinese master painter and sent to outworkers in China to produce commercial<br/>
figures. The original castings, particularly the generals if you are able to<br/>
get hold of them, are of an excellent detail and compare well with other<br/>
(sometimes more expensive) 54mm figures. I wish that I could get hold of<br/>
more unpainted castings. If you haven't already done so have a look at the<br/>
artillery units - great fun!!<br/>

Hi Tai Shogun of UK<br/>

E-mail: <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="mailto:maison@...">maison@...</a><br/>
<br/>
I live close by again soon, so I may visit it sometime, I'm not sure <br/>
if you can get original caste moulds from here. Probably unlikely, I <br/>
will ask.  If you email the website they are very friendly, I did and <br/>
was pleased I got a reply.  I like the T-shirts too with the Fu rin <br/>
ka zan slogan of Takeda Shingen.  <br/>
<br/>
Anyway hope this helps, Mark</div>
