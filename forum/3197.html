<h3>Japanese History</h3>
by <i>nappy_ski_dude</i>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1598608038">I am relatively new to the group so this might be a stupid question but I <br/>
was wondering if any of you could point me in the right direction of getting <br/>
a degree in Japanese history.  I know I should check out my local college  <br/>
but it seems they do not have a program.  Also do any of you know if it is <br/>
possible to get a degree by doing distance learning?  I would appreciate any <br/>
help I could get.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks!<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-139893575">I can't say I know how many degree courses are out there on Japanese <br/>
history.<br/>
As for distance learning, it may depend on which country you're in. I <br/>
would highly recommend the Open University based in the UK for any <br/>
distance learning. I got an English Literature degree with them and <br/>
their standards are very high. I also did it while travelling around <br/>
Europe (posted essays via UPS). So I don't think it matters which <br/>
country you're in. Again, I don't know if they do a course on <br/>
Japanese history. Take a look at their website. <br/>
