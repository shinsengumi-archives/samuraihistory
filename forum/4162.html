    Mr. Alexander,<br/>
<br/>
      Aikidoka, Kendoka, and Iaidoka all mean "one who practices ____"  (Aikido, <br/>
    Kendo, or Iaido depending on the root word).  Generally the -ka suffix <br/>
    attached to the name of a style of martial arts means "practicioner."<br/>
      I hope that helped.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
    Peace,<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1505619985">To all concerned,<br/>
<br/>
  Allow me to give a larger definition of Iaido.  Back in the 1500s a man <br/>
named Hayashizaki Jinsuke Minamoto no Shigenobu sought to learn the sword <br/>
arts in order to avenge the death of his father.  During the course of his <br/>
study he spent a series of days praying and meditating at the Hayashizaki <br/>
Jinja during which he received a "divine vision" of techniques involving <br/>
drawing the katana and cutting the opponent all in the same motion.  After <br/>
some more training he sought out his fathers killer and exacted his revenge. <br/>
  Having repaid his debt to the memory of his father he then founded his own <br/>
swordsmanship style.  At the time techniques like that were called <br/>
battou-jutsu techniques.  The name "Iaido" did not come around until the <br/>
early 20th Century when a swordsman name Nakayama Hakudo took his gathered <br/>
knowledge of (I believe) six different styles based off of Hayashizaki's <br/>
teachings and found his own style, called Muso Shinden Ryu Iaido.<br/>
  That is as good of a quick definition that I can give you.  If you have <br/>
any more questions about Iaido, be they technical or theoretical, feel free <br/>
to ask me.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Peace,<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1879726621">I can add something...<br/>
There are several "schools" with their iaido's kata;among them are Muso Shinden Ryu Iaido and, also the famous, Yagyu Shinkage Ryu.<br/>
I don't know how many schools exist in Japan but now Iaidoka like me learn in particular SEI-TEI-IAI. To make a long story short it is a summa of all the existing kata. <br/>
Only 12 kata were choiced to create SEI TEI IAI from all the scholl in Japan.<br/>
Theorically these kata represent a samurai who undergoes an attack to surprise and he defeats the enemy by a rapid "battou".<br/>

<h3>Re: Iaido</h3>

<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1903069283">Hi Matt - <br/>
<br/>
Your post is substantially correct, but I did want to address a <br/>
point which might be my misinterpretation of your post  - <br/>
<br/>
From my understanding the 'draw-and-cut' in one fluid <br/>
movement - batto-jutsu, nuki-uchi et al was in existence before <br/>
the appearance of Hayashizaki, however, as you say, as a result <br/>
of his application he had a considerable impact on its <br/>
development and on the psycho-spiritual dynamic involved in its <br/>
philosophy and practice.<br/>
<br/>
What form this latter element took has been lost (or remains <br/>
secret) I believe, but Hayashizaki's name was attached to a <br/>
plethora of styles, many which sprang from the lineage of his ryu.<br/>

existed, it is just a matter of being the one who gets the credit for it and <br/>
Hayashizaki was lucky enough to get the majority of the credit for <br/>

<h3>A POEM FOR EVERYBODY</h3>

<br/>
JAPANESE MIND<br/>
------------------<br/>
<br/>
A highly adaptive brain<br/>
Inclined towards<br/>
Uniformity - that's <br/>
The Japanese mind.<br/>
Their first contacts with<br/>
The Chinese led to a mad <br/>
Scramble of their writing <br/>
Systems which they miraculously<br/>
Made to fit into their language<br/>
Even though the two language<br/>
Grammar structures are <br/>
As different as <br/>
Fire is from water.<br/>
But the Japanese creative<br/>
And versatile brains <br/>
Proved capable in <br/>
Turning the impossible <br/>
Into possibility.<br/>
The Chinese Kanji<br/>
Together with Hiragana,<br/>
Another Chinese inspired writing system<br/>
Were employed in such an<br/>
Ingenious way that they<br/>
Portray the Japanese<br/>
Language efficiently. <br/>
For uniformity, the Katakana<br/>
Writing system was invented<br/>
To differentiate imported<br/>
Words from Japanese and Kanji.<br/>
The Japanese had had so much<br/>
Training in the adaptation <br/>
Of foreign Knowledge into<br/>
Their own so that <br/>
When they made their<br/>
First contacts with Western<br/>
Technology, it did not<br/>
Take them long to learn <br/>
And make use of the <br/>
Foreign knowledge<br/>
In the best way -<br/>
Like the way they had made<br/>
Used of the Chinese writing<br/>
Systems to portray their<br/>
Own thoughts.<br/>
Throw the Japanese any<br/>
New Knowledge and you will<br/>
Be sure they will soon<br/>
Digest it, adapt it and<br/>
Come back to surprise<br/>
You with something new.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
