<h3>Saigo Takamori and samurai clans??</h3>

<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1091162283">I am looking for more informations about Saigo Takamori, specially Satsuma <br/>
battle.<br/>
My wife's family is from an old samurai clan, and there's an interesting history <br/>
that has connections with Takamori. And I believe that to understand <br/>
Takamori steps, and about samurai culture about family name, to maybe be <br/>
able to understant their ancients steps<br/>
They know that when Takamori told something about China representing <br/>
danger for Japan, he decided to atack China. So, showing that he was a <br/>
greate leader, he and his army moved to south Japan to group lots more of <br/>
samurais.<br/>
Some people did not agree with Takamori idea, and some fights occourred in <br/>
Japan, near Satsuma. Due this, it was necessary more samurai warriors to <br/>
keep fighting!!<br/>
So... my wife's grand-grandfather was a samurai, but he choosed do not fight. <br/>
To do not fight he changed his family name from Miyaji clan to Waricoda clan.<br/>
Waricoda was another samurai clan that was desapearing, because there <br/>
was no other man in the family to keep the family name.<br/>
In japanese family name ranking, Waricoda is one of a rare family name!! The <br/>
lastest Waricoda in all world are my wife parents, uncles, ...<br/>
However we must to understand why exactly the family changed to Waricoda, <br/>
and we would like to know a litle more about samurai Miyaji clan.<br/>
There's anywebsite where could I find informations about old japanese <br/>
families? Or more about Takamori?<br/>
