European fencing places the sword the furest away from the body than any <br/>
other sword art.  Therefore it styles are modified for more straight in <br/>
attacks.  Scoring with the tip instead of the side of the blade so to speak.<br/>
Sheild and sword can also be straight in however there differences.  The <br/>
sheild is used to block and also deflect to the side for a return side of <br/>
blade cut.  When this happens the body dynamics are more side to side or <br/>
obleaque than straight in.  The sheild colaspes or moves way left, either way <br/>
protect the heart from side and forward attacks.  It also prevents other <br/>
forms of damage coming from your opponent.  The opponents are in very close <br/>
to each other.  Unlike fencing where it is difficult to reach out and place <br/>
your hand on your opponent you can use grabs, shoulders, stepping on feet, <br/>
thigh kicks with the knees in sword and sheild.  If you want to strike your <br/>
opponent, the sword arm comes forward for the strike.  Hence, the heart is <br/>
protected.  It needs to come past the sheild to do this.  If the sheild is <br/>
still in front of you then you are facing your opponent square on.  Sword and <br/>
sheild have been used as a means of fighting alot longer than the refined <br/>
fencing styles.<br/>
However, the point is to compare to japanese sword arts.  The katana is a <br/>
side of the blade weapon more so that a tip type blade.  It attacks are close <br/>
in and more from a side angle than the up in the face, high over head, open <br/>
your belly style.  Both hands tend to come into use for in feild combat <br/>
purposes.  This would place the attack perpendicular the the opponents <br/>
center.  When enterening or leaving the current attack, youe generally can <br/>
switch to a single right hand to create or remain in contact with the <br/>
opponent.  The handle of the katanas in the 15th through the 18th century <br/>
were longer for more leverage and srtength with the blade.  The strengh was <br/>
needed for close contact.  If you move up to later time frames, the length of <br/>
the handles were shortened for style reason more than combat reasons.  The <br/>
gentleman were bumping into things with the longer blades and handles being <br/>
word in their belts.  This lead to single hand style iaido.  The blades were <br/>
also lightened with grooves.<br/>
All of this become apparent when you have these different blades in hand and <br/>
can try them out.<br/>
No disrespect but arguing about right and left handed practioners of the <br/>
sword arts is of no value.  The dogma of any ART lies within the practioner <br/>
and their understand of its application.  There are excpetions to everything. <br/>
 Some things are better to do one way and others not.  But if the practioner <br/>
can make a ART work for them using nondogmatic ways than so be it.  Lets not <br/>
get started on exceptions.  The Japanese made rules for everything.  This is <br/>
a way to control a society.  The rules and teachings of sword arts are <br/>
created for specific reasons.  Ask a swordmaster this question for his <br/>
understanding.  Each one you ask will have a different reason.  Ask Toshiro <br/>
Obata at www.shinkendo.com or James Williams at www.bugei.com.<br/>
If anyone needs to have this go further, I suggest take lessons in multiple <br/>
sword arts, read about blade combat tatics, and move on.<br/>
I have a whole lot more but I think you get the point.<br/>
