<div id="ygrps-yiv-1478136085">Hi,<br/>
<br/>
I am currently looking for some information (and hopefully some <br/>
pictures)<br/>
about hairstyles showing one's status, focused on sengoku era.<br/>
Does anybody has some information about this? I think that buke had a<br/>
specific mage but i think that other casts had also specific ones, <br/>
and that<br/>
there were more than one hairstyle for a specific cast. Was it true? <br/>
Any<br/>
Extra info?<br/>
<br/>
Thank you,<br/>
<br/>
Jerome.</div>
