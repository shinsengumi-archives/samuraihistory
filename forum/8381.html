<h3>Tokugawa</h3>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-88994442">Sadly those who beleive the longevity of the Tokugawa clan's control of <br/>
Japan is due to any particular martial arts form are, with no doubt, <br/>
wrong. It was from the beginning a solid understanding and practice of <br/>
Confucian political beleifs and studies. This has been well documented <br/>
and is without argument. Rather my change of subject conversation was <br/>
how modern Japan has developed, no, rather profitted from 200 years of <br/>
Tokugawa control. I beleive the beauty that is Japan would not be so if <br/>
were not for the 200 years of isolation mandated by the Tokugawas. <br/>
Starting with Ueyesu the Tokugawas ruled unlike any other leaders. Of <br/>
course those who enjoy the battle will say life was better under <br/>
Hideyoshi or even Noubanaga. That exciting timeframe was not the topic <br/>
in the least. My thoughts were directed more to the enforcement of non <br/>
militaristic training for all Tokugawa senior warriors such as the <br/>
arts, his mircomanagement of all aspects of daily life from the only <br/>
approved design and measurement of building houses to how a bucket of <br/>
rice was to be sold and on to even what could and could not be spoken <br/>
of in public.</div>
