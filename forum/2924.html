Nope.. thats why they used iron sparingly in their armour and for the most part it was made out of leather.. the iron they had went towards swords...<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Actually, that's not true. The vast majority of armours -- especially post 1500 <br/>
-- were made entirely of metal. Armour-grade leather was more problematic than <br/>
armour-grade iron.<br/>

the body protection most Japanese do were constructed of many small plates laced together allowing<br/>
it to flex and bend in any direction, as an overall armour the Japanese armour was more flexable, far <br/>
lighter and protected a person almost if not as well as a european armour.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Speaking as one who's worn both types of armour, I can see little difference <br/>
when it comes to the armpit. Both European and Japanese were exposed there, so <br/>
both had alternate methods of dealing with it; the Japanese had the manjuwa or <br/>
wakibiki worn under the armour, and the Europeans had arming doublets with <br/>
integral mail gussets.<br/>
<br/>
I assure you: if articulation is important, you can't articulate better than a <br/>
cloth foundation. The difference is the amount of *solid* protection on the <br/>
sleeves. European were solid, with upper and lower canons and articulated elbow <br/>
cops, while the Japanese didn't provide the same amount of solid protection. <br/>
It's an exchange: the Japanese as a rule was looser and provided a far greater <br/>
range of motion, while the European was more protective and in all but the <br/>
highest quality suits a slightly restricted range of motion.<br/>
<br/>
Were I fighting Europeans, I'd prefer their armour; but fighting the Japanese, <br/>
I'd prefer *theirs*. They were each admirably suited to the milieu in which they <br/>
were used.<br/>
<br/>
(But, yeah, Augsburg armourers made *damn* nice looking stuff!)<br/>

minerals" -- it just means what they have is expensive. <G><br/>

	Japan being  a set of volcanic islands I think would mean they were in <br/>
fact mineral rich. Afterall European traders were notorious for <br/>
leaching Japanese gold from the country any way they could in the <br/>
nineteenth century because it was found to be so pure.<br/>
	Japanese swords were in fact exported in great numbers to China, and I <br/>
believe it was the richness of the local iron and the particular <br/>
impurities therein which helped to make the japanese sword the best in <br/>
the world...<br/>
-t<br/>
production of course was time consuming and therefore never cheap.<br/>
