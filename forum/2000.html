<div id="ygrps-yiv-2124106794">Hi all this is my first posting to this group, but I have been lurking on the nihonto list for some time and I have noticed<br/>
a few familiar names from that group are here as well. I am very much interested in Japanese history and I look forward to <br/>
learning all I can on the subject. To keep this on topic, who do you think was the most tallented general in the Korean<br/>
invasions.........my vote is for Kato Kiyomasa. I would be interested to here your views on the subject.<br/>
<br/>
Best Regards Dave <br/>
