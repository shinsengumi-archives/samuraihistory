<h3>Unorthodox Combat - Samurai View</h3>
by <i>tbsorrentino</i>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1589702505">Greetings to all,<br/>
<br/>
On the wake of Gabriel´s question on Nobunaga, I´d like to pose another.<br/>
<br/>
If I am not wrong, Nobunaga was one of the first warlords to make effective and mass use of firearms (including in a episode against Takeda´s Cavalry).<br/>
<br/>
As far as historic resources go, Samurai were very consencious of the "honoured combat methods", being the sword the material focus (or fetish) of such ethos. <br/>
<br/>
This being said, I´d like to hear from you on the impact of the introduction of mass use of firearms in medieval japanese warfare. How would a brave Samurai, endowed with the armour of tradition and hitherto unchallenged upper-class prerrogatives, would have taken his own defeat by a single blow dealt maybe by the lowest peasant, holding the unorthodox weapon (again, maybe riflemen were not members of the lower classes, but you can correct me on that - if so, how would he take defeat in face of a perhaps less trainned person).<br/>
<br/>
Cheers,<br/>
<br/>
Thiago<br/>

  Well that explains alot then. It just seems so odd that someone who <br/>
  had been successful in his endeavors for a united kingdom would be <br/>
  portrayed as a half demon king with a flaming purple sword and <br/>
  speaking in a voice that makes James Earl Jones seem like pee-wee <br/>
  herman. <br/>
