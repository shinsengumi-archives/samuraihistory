Impertinence forgiven. The point is that it was<br/>
developed by peasants, not samurai, because the<br/>
peasants had no weapons. What works against an armed<br/>
samurai would be effective against an unarmed<br/>
assailant also, no? The original poster was asking<br/>
about samurai influence on unarmed martial arts forms.<br/>
<br/>
*********Kewl. I wanted to check my understanding because I have heard the 'karate was developed as a defense against the samurai' <br/>
many many times.  *******<br/>
<br/>
Rather than being primary developers, they were<br/>
primary antagonists. (And now some "expert" will come<br/>
in and assail me because unarmed techniques that were<br/>
the forerunners of Juujitsu, etc., were developed way<br/>
back when for use if you lost your sword, or<br/>
something. True. But the point is not the<br/>
details--it's that for the most part, the samurai<br/>
weren't injecting some mystical bushido into karate.)<br/>
<br/>
********* Might it be that the karateka were trying to assimilate what they understood as bushido into their own practice? *****<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
 And if they can't<br/>
handle their misconceptions being challenged, that's<br/>
when the compassion tends to slip.<br/>
<br/>
******* Beginner's mind, I think, is best.  It took a long time for me to learn just to do nothing. So simple, and soooooo much <br/>
practice needed, lol.****** Yes, I slip up, especially when I get blind-sided by those 'hormonal surges'. Don't like the taste of <br/>
crow pie, either, when it turns out I am in error. ****<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Myself also. The Lord High Listmaster and myself (I am<br/>
only his trusty minion, with a very minor fief in an<br/>
outlying area of the list) are working on a new rules<br/>
list, and one of those is a request that everyone, oh,<br/>
I don't know, USE PUNCTUATION? It's one thing if<br/>
English is not your primary language--I can make<br/>
allowances for that. However there are many posters on<br/>
this list who are not native English speakers and<br/>
still can make themselves intelligible. They use<br/>
punctuation in most other languages, and it varies<br/>
little.<br/>
<br/>
******** Improper grammar and poor spelling out of ignorance is trainable. Effective but improper grammar and poor spelling in the <br/>
pursuit of fiction writing is an art.  Deliberate improper grammar and spelling to be hip, kewl, or defiant is lazy and is <br/>
demonstrative (to me) of someone who is indeserving of my attention and intelligence.  I try to steer my path clear of that type and <br/>
not waste my energy. I do have my own ways of being obstreperous.*****<br/>

I like finding how others approach the subject of this list, their backgrounds and perspectives, and educations in academia & real <br/>

developed into an art and not simply a means of<br/>
breaking someone's arm, etc. <br/>

get an answer. The problem is when the asker doesn't<br/>

dismiss it, based on other knowledge, and move on.<br/>
Others simply can't abide hearing that their sensei,<br/>

movie, or even read in a book, may be wrong. Even so<br/>
called "experts" can be wrong. <br/>

 </span></blockquote>I was referring to the very profitable mackerel trade<br/>
that took place between Japan and Tartary for about 40<br/>
years. You must have come across it in your studies. I<br/>
believe it was Yoshimitsu who commissioned a certain<br/>
Umitori Shioyaki to travel to Tartary and trade<br/>
Japanese seafood for Mongolian yak products. Shioyaki<br/>
took a load of salted mackerel to the Tartar chieftain<br/>
Ug Li, who enjoyed it so much that soon a thriving<br/>
trade took off. Umitori received the title of "Saba no<br/>
kami" from Yoshimitsu, who for some reason enjoyed<br/>
soured yak's milk. Anyways, after about 30 years Saba<br/>
no kami retired to a remote Shikoku monastery and took<br/>
the name "�C�N" (Kaisen). Shortly thereafter a load of<br/>
mackerel bound for Tartary was not salted before the<br/>
journey. When it arrived, the chieftain accused the<br/>
new envoy, Sanma no suke, of some fishy foul play, and<br/>
had him beheaded, gutted, and broiled at 350 degrees<br/>
until the skin is brown and flaky, but till moist<br/>
underneath...oh, sorry, that's my cookbook. <br/>
<br/>
Anyways, there you have it. Ug Li got sauced in the<br/>
end by his own underlings. A vinagrette, if I'm not<br/>
mistaken. <br/>

"Kewl"? lol. Something like that to be cute or funny<br/>
is fine. talkin lik u r passin notes in ur study hall<br/>
is annoying. I ask, yet again, that people stop it.<br/>
<br/>
************ I began using that term as a phonetic pronunciation of 'cool'.  I like the way it sounds, and it has stuck with me.<br/>

SSHHHH! Don't tell him that. He's got a big enough<br/>
head as it is...lol.<br/>

******** Yah, I know how he can get.  He's much more fun when he's not cranky, which is when I either just ignore him, or I fan the <br/>

Email me off list if you wish--I won't take up more<br/>
bandwidth here. Suffice to say I live and work in<br/>
Tokyo for the time being, though I'm moving to<br/>
Kanagawa soon. Daily life is great, and what is there<br/>
NOT to like in Tokyo? (Except Roppongi. It's icky)<br/>
<br/>
*****I'll do just that, but in a few days, when I have some more time off to play.*****<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Please. I'm begging. Learn to use all your keys, so<br/>
you can type "you" and "are" and not just "u" and "r".<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
No, it's not because of the sailors. It's because of<br/>
the reek of stale alcohol. It's because of the african<br/>
strip clubs touts who won't let you go more than 5<br/>
feet without trying to drag you into some seedy<br/>
establishment where they will take all your money in<br/>
return for a sub-par strip show that lasts 30 secs<br/>
(from what I hear, anyway--never taken them up. I like<br/>
being married, and would like to stay that way). It's<br/>
because of the chinese massage parlor girls that line<br/>
the street asking if you want "massaji?". God, the<br/>
look on their faces is priceless when you tell them<br/>
"Bu hao, wo bu xiang ni" :)<br/>
<br/>
Why would sailors bother me? I'm in the Army. I'm not<br/>
a teacher. And might I suggest, if you're on your way<br/>
to being a teacher, you start practicing punctuation,<br/>
capitalization, and spelling. The students are<br/>
supposed to learn from you, not the other way around. <br/>

 </span></blockquote>Picked that trick up from a friend of mine who's<br/>
fluent in Chinese and travels their often. Most<br/>
round-eyes don't recognize that all the massaji girls<br/>
are Chinese. When they get a roundeye that replies to<br/>
them not only in Chinese but says "I don't want YOU",<br/>
the chattering goes non-stop as I walk away...it's<br/>
priceless. Almost makes me want to go find them, just<br/>
so I can tell them no. <br/>
