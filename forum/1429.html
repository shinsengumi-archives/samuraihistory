<h3>Matsudaira family business</h3>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1490434571">Any ideas on the following would be welcome:<br/>
<br/>
approx 1544<br/>
Matsudaira Hirotada married the daughter of Toda no danjo<br/>
Shohitsu Yasumitsu when the future Ieyasu (Tokachiyo) <br/>
was about 2 years old.<br/>
<br/>
1545<br/>
Very shortly after (as far as I can make out) Toda Yasumitsu <br/>
defected to the Oda.<br/>
<br/>
1546<br/>
Shortly after that, Toda Yasumitsu kidnapped the 4-year-old <br/>
Takechiyo on his way to Sumpu.<br/>
<br/>
My questions:<br/>
<br/>
What was the name of Toda's daughter (Hirotada's wife)?<br/>
<br/>
What happened to her? (Hirotada sent his first wife (Odai) back <br/>
to her brother after Mizuno Nobumoto broke with the<br/>
Imagawa - did he do the same with his second wife?)<br/>
<br/>
Sadler, in his biog. of Ieyasu, mentions Toda Yasumitsu and his <br/>
brother Goro (of Imarashi Castle) - other sources mention <br/>
Yasumitsu and his son, Masanao, but no mention of a brother - <br/>
are both true?<br/>
<br/>
Tawara and Imarashi castles were overthrown after Toda's<br/>
defection. Presumably they survived to live the bandit life <br/>
(or at least at large) to kidnap Takechiyo a year or so later.<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
I am currently writing a peice of historical fiction (loosely) <br/>
based around these events - any answers or ideas would be <br/>
welcome.<br/>
<br/>
No, I don't read Japanese, so yes, I am working under somewhat <br/>
of a disadvantage (to put it lightly), but hey - it didn't hurt <br/>
James Clavell none!<br/>
<br/>
I also have the first chapter ready. If anyone's interested let <br/>
me know, and I'll figure out somewhere to put it!<br/>
