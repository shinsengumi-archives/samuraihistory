<h3>Another sword question</h3>
by <i>zevlord</i>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1716974322">Hi all another questions on swords. <br/>
Was just wondering if anyone knows much about the blades of the <br/>
Samurai sword. Swords are classified into categories by the length of <br/>
its blade if i'm correct, for example a katana is a katana due to its <br/>
blade being over two SHAKU. But what about the style and shape of the <br/>
blade, can a Katana be a Torii Sori style with a Unokubi  zukuri <br/>
shape.  Also could you help my with this: <br/>
"Koa Isshin Mantetsu with Buke Zukuri Koshirae" <br/>
I think the Buke Zukuri Koshirae is some sort of mounting style. And <br/>
I guess the Koa Isshin Mantetsu is the shape of the blade maybe? Any <br/>
help would be great.</div>

	Koa Isshin is the Greater Asian Co-prosperity sphere as it is <br/>
sometimes translated, and represents Japanese dreams of an asian <br/>
empire. Mantetsu is Manchurian railroad steel (Manchu-tetsu). Koa <br/>
Isshin mantetsu-to are swords produced for the war effort austensibly <br/>
using Materials and techniques invented by persons involved with the <br/>
Machurian Railworks. You'll find several articles about these blades on <br/>
the Japanese Sword Index <br/>
site;<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://home.earthlink.net/~steinrl/nihonto.htm">http://home.earthlink.net/~steinrl/nihonto.htm</a><br/>
Look under the section on Japanese swordsmiths.<br/>
	Buke-zukuri means "Bushi-style" or made for a warrior, or koshirae in <br/>
accord with warrior tastes. This term is generally used to mean a <br/>
working-man samurai scabbard and handle, to differentiate it from say <br/>
Gun-to koshirae which is what one expects to see a Mantetsu-to in...<br/>

<blockquote><span title="ireply"> >how long is a SHAKU ???<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Like most things, the answer is actually "it depends". There is a <br/>
modern definition of shaku which is defined in mercantile law. this <br/>
is the shaku that zevlord has given you - it is almost exactly <br/>
equal to a US 'foot', or about 30 cm.<br/>
<br/>
But even today there are different kinds of shaku for different <br/>
purposes (the most famous example being the kujira-jaku which is <br/>
used in creating kimono). Historically there were many different <br/>
kinds of shaku depending on the time period, the thing being <br/>
measured, and the location. There were not large differences (shaku <br/>
never means '60 cm' for example).<br/>
<br/>
In other words - today when a person says 'shaku' you can think <br/>
'about 30 cm', and probably be safe. But when reading history, it's <br/>
actually quite difficult to know what might have been meant by <br/>
'shaku' in any given circumstance.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1108231230">HI<br/>
<br/>
I think there are several reasons why the names are<br/>
used.<br/>
<br/>
IN some  martial schools the kodachi is used but its<br/>
nothing more than a wakizashi. In the Hon Tai Yoshin<br/>
Ryu and kukishin Ryu the kodachi kata are all done<br/>
with a wakizashi. The one I use has a blade 18 inch<br/>
(46cm)<br/>
<br/>
the kodachi I believe was the forerunner of the<br/>
wakizashi. Wakizashi tend to match your katana to<br/>
produce matching daisho<br/>

name for the companion sword that changed during the times. Once, the<br/>
companion sword wasn't regulated by length-rules and it went from<br/>
something like a long Tanto for collecting heads or close combat in full<br/>
armor (IoroiDoshi) till to short swords, often in hirazukuri style. The<br/>
worldwide known ShinogiZukuri style Wakizashi as a smaller replica of<br/>
the main blade went in fashion later, even if ShinogiZukuri wasn't an<br/>

So, a matter of time and names, or how we use the words rather than<br/>
styles and length, in my opinion. <br/>

difference in sugata and koshirae. A ko-dachi is a short tachi blade and<br/>
tends to be slimmer and longer in sugata than most wakizashi and is properly<br/>
mounted in tachi koshirae. In other words it is a smaller slung sword whilst<br/>
a wakizashi is worn with the cutting edge uppermost and is paired with a<br/>
katana to form the daisho. In modern kendo kata, as we have said before, the<br/>
shorter bokuto is also refered to in common usage as a kodachi.<br/>

Ladies and Gentlemen, as temporary list moderator,<br/>
I've had to reject two messages from a certain<br/>
individual in the past day. Granted, these were<br/>
emotional childish outbursts laced with the "f" word,<br/>
but the underlying issue is that we weren't kind<br/>
enough to answer what a "daimyo" is for the young man.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Yes, I understand that if you do a google search you<br/>
should find an answer in about .03 nanoseconds. Yes, I<br/>
also understand that we are not a crutch for people<br/>
who don't want to do research. That being said, here's<br/>
a short answer that hopefully will suffice:<br/>
<br/>
Daimo: "Great Name" a feudal lord of the samurai class<br/>
in pre-Meiji Japan. Daimyo were generally considered<br/>
the pre-eminent ruler in their fief, and controlled<br/>
everything that happened therein. Prior to the<br/>
Tokugawa Shogunate, the Daimyo were essentially<br/>
"warlords" controlling territory by force of arms,<br/>
enlarging it as they could. Subsequently, they held<br/>
their fiefs either by being granted them by the<br/>
Shogunate, or with the Shogunate's permission,<br/>
anyways. Daimyo had an army of samurai retainers,<br/>
generally speaking, to maintain order in their domains<br/>
and to fight wars when necessary. Once the Tokugawa<br/>
period began, there was a minimum income to be<br/>
considered a "daimyo"--I don't know off hand what it<br/>
was, but I'm sure you can look it up somewhere.<br/>
<br/>
There's a basic answer. <br/>
<br/>

and to fight wars when necessary. Once the Tokugawa<br/>
period began, there was a minimum income to be<br/>
considered a "daimyo"--I don't know off hand what it<br/>
was, but I'm sure you can look it up somewhere.<br/>
<br/>
There's a basic answer. <br/>

A Kodachi is a small Tachi:      Tachi Blade length being over 2 Shaku<br/>

Wakizashi is a smaller sword:    Blade length being between 1 and 2 <br/>
shaku.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Well, I hate to tell you this, but there was no "discipline" or "spiritual way <br/>
of life."<br/>
<br/>
You've bought into the myth. The myth promulgated during the Edo period when <br/>
there were no more wars -- a myth designed to give the non-warrior warrior class <br/>
a mystique and reason for being.<br/>
<br/>
Samurai were just like everyone else. Some were brave, some were not; some were <br/>
clever, some were not; some were devout, some were not; some believed in loyalty <br/>
above all, some believed in looking out for number one.<br/>
<br/>
Think about it. If there was a single universal code of bushido, there never <br/>
would have been any conflict or struggle because SOMEONE SOMEWHERE was violating <br/>
that "code" to create struggle.<br/>

Oggetto: Re: [samuraihistory] Re: Another sword question<br/>
<br/>
The essential difference between a ko-dachi and a wakizashi is a<br/>
difference in sugata and koshirae. A ko-dachi is a short tachi blade and<br/>
tends to be slimmer and longer in sugata than most wakizashi and is<br/>
properly<br/>
mounted in tachi koshirae. In other words it is a smaller slung sword<br/>
whilst<br/>
a wakizashi is worn with the cutting edge uppermost and is paired with a<br/>
katana to form the daisho. In modern kendo kata, as we have said before,<br/>
the<br/>
shorter bokuto is also refered to in common usage as a kodachi.<br/>

<h3>Etiquette/Daimyo question</h3>
by <i>deanwayland</i>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-126226256">Hi, I've just been reading my back messages, and I feel that although I<br/>
understand why some folks feel the way they do about what they consider<br/>
as simplistic questions, that they were unduly harsh on the chap asking<br/>
about daimyo. Remember, that sometimes it takes a little courage to post<br/>
in a field where you know nothing, and receiving such a hostile<br/>
reception can kill a budding interest in a subject stone dead. I would<br/>
suggest that if you feel a questioner's enquiry is not worthy of your<br/>
time and efforts to reply to, then, simply don't. Leave it to someone<br/>
else, and if no one wishes to reply, so be it. Sometimes I find dealing<br/>
with so-called "simple" questions makes me rethink my own assumptions<br/>
about the knowledge that I "think" I have in the subject being<br/>
considered, and thus helps me to master it:-)<br/>
<br/>
Finally to add a piece to Nate's answer re daimyo: the required income<br/>
during the Tokugawa shogunate or Edo era (1600-1868) to be considered as<br/>
a daimyo was 10,000 koku. One koku was the amount of rice required to<br/>
feed one person for one year, and served as a measure of wealth for what<br/>
was fundamentally an agricultural society. A koku is a fraction over 180<br/>
litres of rice or about 300 pounds in weight. Will Adams, the first<br/>
Englishman in Japan, in a letter dated 1611 recounted that he and his<br/>
crew were each given an income of "2 pounds of rice a day", which is 2.4<br/>
koku a year. IIRC to be a samurai you had to have an income exceeding<br/>
1,000 koku, while the richest daimyo in the land Tokugawa Ieyasu, the<br/>
first of the Edo era shogun's had an income of over 4 million koku a<br/>
year!.<br/>
<br/>
I hope the chap who posted has hung around to read this, if so I hope<br/>
you find this stuff useful.<br/>

by <i>naomasa298</i>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1467087498">If I could add a few things:<br/>
<br/>
Apart from the classifications of daimyo (fudai, tozawa etc.), <br/>
daimyo were also classified by their income during the Edo period.<br/>
<br/>
Kokushu, with very large landholdings, often across multiple <br/>
provinces.<br/>
Joshu, holders of castles.<br/>
Ryoshu, castle-less daimyo with 10,000 or more koku.<br/>
<br/>
The exact definitions of these classes seems to be a little <br/>
nebulous, although they are specifically mentioned in the Buke <br/>
Shohatto.<br/>
<br/>
You didn't have to have a specified level of income to be a samurai -<br/>
 this was a social class rather than a function of wealth - there <br/>
were plenty of rich merchants who had significantly more income than <br/>
many samurai. I'm unsure about the level of stipend received by <br/>
poorer samurai, but there are many stories of samurai being forced <br/>
to literally sell their swords through poverty.<br/>
<br/>
I've seen some claim of certain hatamoto being classified according <br/>
to their income, but this would seem to vary from clan to clan, <br/>
rather than being fixed across the board.<br/>

a (barely) passing knowledge of nihongo, and an interest in the <br/>

myself for aikido ;) which is notoriously hard to find a master for <br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>In much of Japan (except the region immediately around Kyoto) the assessment in the Sengoku was in kandaka, which is to say in money terms rather than rice. I'm still digging into the story of the transition to the kokudaka system, which took place under Hideyoshi.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> >Will Adams, the first<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>There was a difference between one's kokudaka and income. The kokudaka was the nominal productive capacity of the fief, while the tax revenues varied but were usually around 30% to 40% of the kokudaka. If you were a low-ranked stipendiary rather than a fief-holder your stipend might be reckoned in hyo of 0.35 koku, so that a man with a stipend of 100 hyo actually received 35 koku (when not required to make a "loan" to his daimyo or shogun). Generally, one whose stipend was stated in koku rather than hyo had higher status, but got no more. That is, a stipend of 100 koku would bring in about the same net income as one of 100 hyo.<br/>
<br/>
According to _Learning from Shogun_, William Adams (he never called himself "Will", noble a name though it be) held a fief with a kokudaka of 250 koku, comprising the villiage of Hemimura in what is today Yokusuka. This was quite a substantial property and implies a certain dignity to his station. Indeed, there is reason to believe that he wore the two swords of the samurai, although he almost certainly was not regarded as a samurai per se.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> >IIRC to be a samurai you had to have an income exceeding<br/>
>1,000 koku, <br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>No. It is reckoned that the greatest number of shogunal housemen had stipends of only 30 to 70 hyo. Needless to say, this meant miserable poverty unless one found other ways to augment it. In 1700 in Okayama han, 93 samurai were recorded as having less than 10 hyo, and in 1840-44 there were more than 1,000 with less than 20 hyo. It was quite impossible to live on less than 10 hyo (3.5 koku of rice income) and impossible to do more than merely subsist on less than 20 -- all these men had to find some way of supplementing their incomes quite substantially. In some rural han, stipends as low as 4 hyo equivalent were recorded, although it is thought that these were men with only nominal samurai duties who really were farmers.<br/>
<br/>
A swordsmith (who was not a samurai, of course) might have 100 hyo, and other valued specialist craftsmen often got 50 or more.<br/>
<br/>

 </span></blockquote>This was Iyasu's kokudaka, not his income. Recall that the entire direct expense of the bakufu was borne out of the shogun's lands, since he received no tax revenues from the han. Thus his kokudaka was not so munificent as might seem.<br/>

<h3>More Daimyo</h3>
by <i>idiotkid43</i>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-2035723564">Ryoshu Daimyo were caslte-less, as I read on another post.  Where did they live?  Amongst who, villages, farms?  Who did they rule?<br/>
 <br/>
200-300 Daimyo families during the Tokugawa era.  How many were in the family?  Who and why did they fight?  Who trains Daimyo?<br/>
 <br/>
Did they train their young?<br/>
 <br/>
I realize the simplicity of the questions again, and maybe some of them don't make any sense -- but, I need this information.  I'm having a hard time getting a grasp on what a daimyo samurai is.  I not retarded, I've read up on samurai.  I've done google searches as suggested. <br/>
 <br/>
My bloodline is samurai -- suyuki/minamoto.  I have family trees.  My brother and I have traced our heritage back to Daimyo, or so we think?  I've read Bushido, nothing about daimyo, I've read the Five Rings, again, nothing, the last Samurai, before it became popular, nothing.  I've asked my grandmother, she refuses to speak of it; all she gave us was a family history written by her great-grandfather; from there my brother and I have started a mad project to get to the bottom of our roots.  Any help would be awesome.<br/>
 <br/>
I would like to thank the compassionate Dean Wayland for shedding light on all of our negativity, including mine.<br/>

<br/>
Finally to add a piece to Nate's answer re daimyo: the required income<br/>
during the Tokugawa shogunate or Edo era (1600-1868) to be considered as<br/>
a daimyo was 10,000 koku. One koku was the amount of rice required to<br/>
feed one person for one year, and served as a measure of wealth for what<br/>
was fundamentally an agricultural society. A koku is a fraction over 180<br/>
litres of rice or about 300 pounds in weight. Will Adams, the first<br/>
Englishman in Japan, in a letter dated 1611 recounted that he and his<br/>
crew were each given an income of "2 pounds of rice a day", which is 2.4<br/>
koku a year. IIRC to be a samurai you had to have an income exceeding<br/>
1,000 koku, while the richest daimyo in the land Tokugawa Ieyasu, the<br/>
first of the Edo era shogun's had an income of over 4 million koku a<br/>
year!.<br/>

<br/>
Half the time, as per the "alternate residence" rule instituted by <br/>
the Tokugawa, they spent their time in Edo. At other times, they <br/>
would have had residences either in towns or mansions of their own. <br/>
Only one castle was permitted per province during this period, which <br/>
led to a large number of castles being torn down, although many had <br/>
their keeps moved and incorporated into other castles.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> > 200-300 Daimyo families during the Tokugawa era.  How many were in <br/>
 </span></blockquote>the family?  Who and why did they fight?  Who trains Daimyo?<br/>
<br/>
It varies from family to family. Other than immediate family <br/>
members, a household would also consist of retainers. Several <br/>
families had multiple, often distantly connected, branches. The <br/>
Matsudaira for example - there were a lot of Matsudaira daimyo.<br/>
<br/>
For the most part, they didn't fight. Apart from a few peasant <br/>
uprisings, the Edo period was mostly peaceful.<br/>
<br/>
As for "training", households would have retainers, or hired <br/>
scholars for that. In earlier times, it wasn't uncommon for children <br/>
to be sent to temples for their education - Uesugi Kenshin, for <br/>
example, spent seven years at the Rinzen-ji between the ages of 7-<br/>
14, although that was partly forced by the civil war in his own clan.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> > Did they train their young?<br/>

<br/>
In *very* simplistic terms:<br/>
A "samurai" is a member of the military class of feudal Japan. Note <br/>
that you didn't need to know how to fight to be a samurai in Edo-<br/>
period Japan - you simply had to be a member of that social class.<br/>
<br/>
A "daimyo" was a military governor, who administered lands on behalf <br/>
of/by the grace of the Shogun's government. Daimyo were appointed <br/>
from samurai families, but not every samurai was a daimyo - in the <br/>
same way that not every member of the military is a general.</div>

<h3>Origin of Kohaze for tabi</h3>
by <i>deanwayland</i>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-990773788">Greetings All,<br/>
<br/>
Okay, I have some questions regarding historical footwear which I hope<br/>
some one out there can help me with:<br/>
<br/>
I know that many period tabi were split across the top of the foot and<br/>
secured with a pair of ties, rather than being split at the rear and<br/>
closed with kohaze or "clasps" as per modern tabi. But are these modern<br/>
kohaze derived from a period version?<br/>
<br/>
When did the rear split style of tabi and their related kohaze first<br/>
appear?<br/>
<br/>
What sorts of materials where used to make the early kohaze?<br/>
<br/>
I personally haven't found any information earlier than 1906, when they<br/>
were being mass produced, probably in copper, by a Japanese company, who<br/>
say that their design was based upon a style formally made by hand by<br/>
skilled craftsman, which at least pushes them back in to the 19th<br/>
century. <br/>
<br/>
All the modern ones I've seen are of aluminium, often plated in nickel,<br/>
and on occasion in brass. I've seen very large bone ones for book<br/>
bindings on the net, but so far, nothing else apart from these modern<br/>
varieties.<br/>
<br/>
Although I've been informed that such a device was used on a kind of Edo<br/>
period "spat" called a kougake, probably some form of kiahan like<br/>
garment (leggings), apparently illustrated on "page 281 of Edo Fukushoku<br/>
Shi. (History of Edo Costume)", a work that I do not as yet have access<br/>
to. Many modern kiahan made for martial arts practitioners have kohaze<br/>
mounted on elastic to achieve a good fit, possibly a hang over of this<br/>
earlier garment.<br/>
<br/>
Confession: I am trying to arrange the reproduction of these items for a<br/>
momoyama-jidai living history/role playing project, and if it were<br/>
possible to simply replace the aluminium kohaze of modern tabi with a<br/>
correct fitting, this would be much easier than having to make tabi from<br/>
absolute scratch. Especially as I can now get hold of tabi in<br/>
traditionally patterned cloth, rather than just plain dark blue and<br/>
white.<br/>
<br/>
Okay, that's it, any input would be most appreciated.<br/>
<br/>
Yours<br/>
<br/>
