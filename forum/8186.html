Resurrection of 47 masterless samurai<br/>
<br/>
By DONALD RICHIE<br/>
<br/>
KUNIYOSHI: The Faithful Samurai, by David R. Weinberg, translations<br/>
and essay by Alfred H. Marks, Foreword by B.W. Robinson. Amsterdam:<br/>
Hotei Publishing, 2005, 192 pp., map, pictures, color plates. 39.50<br/>
euro (paper).<br/>
<br/>
This is the paperback edition (first published in 2000) of one of the<br/>
most interesting of the many finely designed portfolios published by<br/>
the Dutch publishing house Hotei. It is devoted to the portraits of 47<br/>
loyal masterless samurai or ronin.<br/>
<br/>
Their story is well known. In 1701 there was an altercation in Edo<br/>
Castle. A provincial lord, perceiving insult, drew his sword, an act<br/>
considered a capital offense. He was ordered to commit suicide,<br/>
leaving his samurai leaderless.<br/>
<br/>
On a snowy day at the end of 1702, these ronin marched to the mansion<br/>
of the man they held responsible, decapitated him and offered his head<br/>
at the grave of their leader, thus completing their famous revenge.<br/>
<br/>
But revenge had in the otherwise fairly peaceful 18th-century been<br/>
made a capital offense, leaving Tokugawa authorities no recourse but<br/>
to order the loyal ronin to kill themselves, hara kiri being the<br/>
designated method. Such an order, however, contradicted one of the<br/>
stipulations of the samurai code: that one should not live under the<br/>
same heaven nor tread the same earth as the enemy of one's lord.<br/>
<br/>
The suicide of the ronin thus became a social issue. Many were the<br/>
pleas for lenience and petitions for pardon. These feelings were<br/>
ignored, yet as David Weinberg puts it in his commentary to this book<br/>
of Kuniyoshi woodblock portraits of the ronin, "something fundamental<br/>
in the character and spirit of the culture had suddenly and<br/>
dramatically been expressed by these warriors."<br/>
<br/>
Its newsworthy importance was highlighted two weeks after the fact,<br/>
when a stage version of the episode was performed. Although all the<br/>
names were changed, everyone knew what the play was about, and its<br/>
popularity was enormous for the three days it ran before the theater<br/>
was summarily closed by the authorities.<br/>
<br/>
Further renditions on both the bunraku and the kabuki stages appeared<br/>
shortly thereafter, and the saga of "Chushingura," ("The Treasury of<br/>
Loyal Retainers") had begun.<br/>
<br/>
Its popularity has long continued. There have been many later versions<br/>
of "Chushingura," including an opera, a ballet and some 85 film<br/>
adaptations, most of them originally intended for a January release,<br/>
as this seemed the most appropriate season for the snow-filled<br/>
vendetta, the climax of the play. This is no longer true, however, and<br/>
such celebratory film versions have ceased to be made. Now the tale is<br/>
the property of television.<br/>
<br/>
Initially, "Chushingura" was so popular that, in addition to the<br/>
various written and staged versions, ukiyo-e artists were soon turning<br/>
out best-selling prints. Hokusai, Utamaro, Hiroshige, Toyokuni,<br/>
Kunisada and many others did illustrations.<br/>
<br/>
They had their differences, however. The use of mitate or parody was<br/>
seen in a number of prints.<br/>
<br/>
Utamaro had a series in which "beautiful women" stood in for the<br/>
warriors and the recondite might recognize this reference or that. In<br/>
addition, there was the agenda of the artist himself.<br/>
<br/>
Hiroshige was mainly interested in landscape, so his prints illustrate<br/>
mainly the outdoor sections of the play.<br/>
<br/>
Hokusai, on the other hand, was interested in psychological anecdote;<br/>
consequently, his series creates a storyboard-like narrative --<br/>
something like manga.<br/>
<br/>
Among the most popular of these series were those of Kuniyoshi<br/>
(1797-1861) who, nearly a century after the actual event, was able to<br/>
return to the story something of its original power and pathos. In<br/>
all, he produced more than 20 "Chushingura" triptychs and several<br/>
series of single-sheet prints devoted to individual portraits of the<br/>
brave band -- a total of some 266 works on the "Chushingura" theme.<br/>
<br/>
In "Kuniyoshi," we are given the two portrait series of the<br/>
individuals who make up the story. Although the "Seichu Gishi Den"<br/>
(the faithful samurai) is more inclusive than the later "Seichu Gishin<br/>
Den" (the faithful hearts), together they comprise practically the<br/>
entire cast of the kabuki version of the play.<br/>
<br/>
Each woodblock print is separately treated with a facing page<br/>
dedicated to the text and a commentary on the text itself, followed by<br/>
a number of appendixes devoted to such matters as calligraphy and<br/>
language. In addition, the particularities of each role are listed and<br/>
the drama is revealed.<br/>
<br/>
One might wonder how these particularities managed to survive for a<br/>
century, but such speculation (along with the fact that all the ronin<br/>
look alike) is beside the point. The point is that something large and<br/>
important is being celebrated -- by the actors, the print-artists, and<br/>
by us.<br/>
<br/>
This could well be that "something fundamental" suggested by Weinberg:<br/>
fidelity above all. At the same time it is also possible to see<br/>
"Chushingura" as protest, as an objection to the shogunate's dictates<br/>
and as a demonstration of anti-authoritorial opinion. This sympathetic<br/>
validation of men that the government had deemed criminal is in itself<br/>
antigovernment.<br/>
<br/>
This is what one also sees in the heroic poses, the powerful lines and<br/>
the gleaming colors of these Kuniyoshi prints. These demonstrate that<br/>
this valiant band was breaking the law for a worthy cause -- for<br/>
something higher than mere law, for the virtue of faithful loyalty.<br/>
