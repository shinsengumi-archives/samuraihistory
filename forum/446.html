<h3>War and weather</h3>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1940040913">The snow and cold definitely affected the status of battles,there're even records of famous battles occurring in that kind of weather.It was mostly a disadvantage for the attacker and an advantage for the defenders.Warm clothes we're needed,the temperature affected the moral of troops,the energy of them and in cases compromise the safety of weapons(firing capacity on matchlocks and temper and breakage in blades).<br/>
