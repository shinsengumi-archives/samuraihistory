I refer to the final one.<br/>
My former Sensei of Shugendo told me that there was a war between IIga and<br/>
Koga clan that ended with the death of the patriarch of the Koga Clan (or<br/>
was IIga?) and the subsequently extintion of the clan and the style of<br/>
Ninpo. Then IIga Clan Master inserted his sword on the soil and take the<br/>
oath that IIga would no longer continue teaching the art of Ninpo and thus,<br/>
in this way both IIGA and Koga ended their existences, at least as Ninpo<br/>
Clans.<br/>
<br/>
It is difficult to find online reference or books with such aspects of<br/>
japanese history. Ya knows... Ninpo issue tend to be very secretive... <=o(<br/>

<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-2133378331">Hi<br/>
<br/>
I wonder if this war did in fact happen.<br/>
<br/>
Most of the Shinobi/Ninja etc from both Iga and Koga,<br/>
had a strong working relationship towards the middle<br/>
of the 17th century. This was partly started by<br/>
Hattori Hanzo, a  senior ninja from Iga who worked for<br/>
Ieyasu and is recorded in many texts as a Samurai. He<br/>
was himself killed by Ninja from the Fuma Ryu while<br/>
trying to arrest the head of that tradition.<br/>
<br/>
The Iga and Koga no mono (another name for ninja)<br/>
ended up working for the Tokugawa, there duties were<br/>
mainly security or police style duties. In fact one fo<br/>
the gates at the Emperoros castle in Tokyo is called<br/>
Hanzo mon (Hanzo's gate).<br/>
<br/>
It is well recorded the Koga and Iga became gardeners<br/>
in the castle as well. where better to have your<br/>
secret men than right under the noses of your people<br/>
and also where you can see them daily. It was partly<br/>
because of these duties that they slowly stopped there<br/>
ninja style practises. You dont need to know how to<br/>
hide in the snowor break into a house when your<br/>
planting marigolds all day.<br/>
<br/>
Donn Roley is a member of the Bujinkan and lives in<br/>
Japan, he has got a name for himself for researchinmg<br/>
real ninja history he wrote this article on the Koga<br/>
ninja which is excellent<br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.shinden.pp.fi/kogaryuhistory.html">http://www.shinden.pp.fi/kogaryuhistory.html</a><br/>
<br/>
I also know of no incident where someone inserted his<br/>
sword into the ground and made an oath that Iga ninja<br/>
would no longer practise. One man would not be able to<br/>
speak for all of the different traditions. This sounds<br/>
like a scene out of some movie to me.<br/>
<br/>
ts sort of like shimizu soke of the Yagyu shingan<br/>
saying no one in japan is permitted to study sword<br/>
now. I think Otake of the Katori shinto Ryu would<br/>
laugh at him and so would the others. Ninjutsu did and<br/>
has survived to this day but not as it was. There are<br/>
many ancient ryu which still maintain tiny elements of<br/>
Ninpo, even Ryu like the Katori shinto Ryu list it in<br/>
there curriculum.<br/>
<br/>
i suggest you go back and ask again about the origin<br/>
of the story<br/>
