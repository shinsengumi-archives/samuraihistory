<h3>Internal wars and there relation to a states decline or  unification.</h3>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-775344232">I have been following with interest the long debate about <br/>
Nagashino and found it fascinating to hear so many different <br/>
opinions.  Then this sparked off a load of non Japanese related <br/>
history.  Which is interesting as it shows how inter related all <br/>
history is.  <br/>
<br/>
        I am interested in the warring states periods of china and <br/>
Japan, recently I read the romance of the three kingdoms which <br/>
highlights how destructive and the scale of warfare was at this <br/>
time.  Mostly I <br/>
do read academic books like Friday, Farell, Owen, etc.  <br/>
        <br/>
        But Sometimes these books go so far into the detail of the <br/>
period I lose sight of the big picture, forgetting that as Japan was <br/>
involved in the Sengoku Jidai the rest of the world was forming it's <br/>
own bounderies.  <br/>
<br/>
        This got me thinking of another question slightly off topic <br/>
but I am following the flow of this debate.  The question is the <br/>
internal wars of Japan and China helped to form it's identity and <br/>
it's position in the world today, it was probably a very neccesary <br/>
thing.  But my problem is theoretically how much stronger would Japan <br/>
have been without these internal wars?.<br/>
<br/>
       I mean the Kamakura shogunate was succesful but it had to <br/>
contend with Kublai Khan and Japan was not as well developed as it <br/>
was by say 1530.  Can you imagine if the daimyo's all got on <br/>
(actually immposible) but if they all worked together it would be an <br/>
incredible power.  If china was united throughout it's history too <br/>
what would that have done to the boundaries of the world today.  I am <br/>
only theorizing but it is obvious that wars are part of human <br/>
society.  But if those wars had only been external (invasions etc) <br/>
(like Hideyoshi Korea) I <br/>
wonder how much stronger the samurai as a class would have been.  <br/>
Perhaps the Sengoku Jidai enabled Ieyasu to come to power and hold <br/>
it, but it also inevitably made Japan stronger but in contradiction <br/>
less able to deal with the Black ships when they arrived.  I <br/>
certainly am not descrediting the Bushi just stating a point.  <br/>
<br/>
Anyone wanna comment.  I have loads more research to do. <br/>
Thanks Mark</div>
