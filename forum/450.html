 </span></blockquote>kewl! just what I needed ^^ thanks relly much for the info... ah one thing<br/>
I am running a historical campaign in medieval japan.. (which portraits<br/>
Takuan soho as one of the most importants npc) anyone can suggest me a good<br/>
bibliography about that character (apart "musashi" which I read around 4<br/>
times in the last 2 months and really liked it) and anyone can address me<br/>
to a good "myth and legends" of medieval japan site? I would like to put an<br/>
Oni as well at a certain point.. but I just want something out of a real<br/>
legend whithout make it up.</div>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-499253225">Hello all,<br/>
 There is no proof at all that Takuan Soho actually knew Miyamoto Musashi. It was very likely that the characters were 'introduced' together by Eiji Yoshikawa for 'artistic purposes' i.e. getting as many famous people of that time in Japan together around Musashi. There is also no proof that Musashi knew Yagyu Munenori but it is here where the truth is used for the story line somewhat. The Yagyu clan leader Munenori was well acquainted with Takuan and had helped the priest when he was expelled from his Temple by the Tokugawa shogun (Iemitsu I believe)..Takuan struck up a firm relationship with the Shinkage school of Kenjutsu and many of the Zen ideas that he propounded were integrated into the schools teaching by Munenori in his 'Tsuki no Sho'..a book about the methods of the ryu.<br/>
 You might want to check out "The sword and the mind" by Hiroaki Sato (overlook press) for more information on the relationships with Takuan and the Yagyu Shinkage..or you could try "The Unfettered mind" by Takuan Soho (published by Kodansha) for insight into the beliefs that Takuan gave to Munenori..there is also a brief biography of the monk there.<br/>
 Be careful if your presentation is on facts..Musashi and his history is very obscure and finding the truth is near impossible. However it is almost certain that Takuan and Musashi did not meet..they would possibly have known of each other..but events in the book by Yoshikawa were used and made up for the appeal to the audience more than for historical research.<br/>
 Good luck with your presentation!<br/>
