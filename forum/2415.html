Yahiko: Next time, let's follow the opposite of Sano's instincs!<br/>
Sano: Maybe I should have left you there to be flatten like a pancake<br/>
 <br/>
and there's another one I remember. It was said by Misao and some men she tried to steal from:<br/>
Men: Hey, what's wrong now? Are you scared? ...You said we can do it...you know...<br/>
Misao: Oh, I'm scared... you see, i'm still a virgin, hihihi...<br/>
Men: WOE!!! REALLY?!!! Let's see what you got!<br/>
Misao: OK...(takes off her cloak) YEAH! Now give me all the money you got! Hand it over! <br/>
Men: Forget it. She's a girl.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1367940609">The first episode of Rouroni Kenshin, when Kaouro is being harrased by<br/>
the group of men who begin mocking her desire to teach the use of the<br/>
sword as a tool of protection.<br/>
Kenshin walks into the dojo and says something to the effect of, "It<br/>
is true that the sword and the art of swordsmanship are tools of<br/>
death, and what Miss Kaouro says are the sweet and innocent words of<br/>
one who has never slain a man.  However, I  would like it very much to<br/>
be the truth one day, that I would."<br/>
