<div id="ygrps-yiv-114611172">I am not very good at evaluating swords.  However, from the shape of <br/>
the handle it looks like an imperial navy sword.  I am not sure <br/>
though.  I base this judgement on a replica of an imperial navy <br/>
dagger I saw, but the shape was identical to that.  Please correct me <br/>
if I am wrong.  I would love to learn more about swords.</div>
