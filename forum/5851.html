Thank you for your responses, the reason for my dilemma is that I'm listing <br/>
these swords in a catalogue for an Museum exhibition for the general public <br/>
in the US.  Like you all are, I am too, familiar with Shaku etc. I was <br/>
interested (seeing as what Japans secondary measurement is) seeing what your <br/>
secondary measurement was. Harry, I laughed myself to within a gnats c**k of <br/>
a heart attack, and you can't put that into metric either.<br/>
<br/>
Can I just use this airtime to remind you all of the forthcoming "Tosho: The <br/>
Yoshihara Tradition of Japanese Swordmaking" Exhibition at the Pacific Asia <br/>
Museum in Pasadena CA. It is from March to June next year.(Just a little <br/>
topical side-note about myself, I cared for the swords in the British Museum <br/>
exhibition from when they were newly polished in 2000, up until Feb 2003).  <br/>
Additionally the Pacific Asia Museum is a private, non-profit museum. They <br/>
are trying to raise the final $10,000 at the moment for the exhibition <br/>
catalogue, if anyone can assist it would be greatly appreciated. If you <br/>
would like to make a donation, please contact the Museum and specify that <br/>
the donation is for the catalogue. The catalogue will contain historically <br/>
interesting pictures of Shodai Kuniie, as well as photography of great <br/>
swords including A  large katana by shodai Kuniie with a fantastic horimono, <br/>
Ono Yoshimitsu's Yamatorige (photographed by Fujishiro Okisato) and many <br/>
swords by the Yoshihara family members and former deshi. Please keep an eye <br/>
on the Pacific Asia Museum website for updates.<br/>
