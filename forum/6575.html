<h3>Shimazu Mon & Sashimonos</h3>
by <i>russcat9</i>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-268799216">I've seen sashimonos of the Shimazu clan depicting the clan mon and<br/>
also the particular lord's personal mon. Which is it?<br/>
<br/>
Also, as I understand it, Shimazu Yoshihisa used a white mon on a<br/>
black background for his personal version of the clan mon, while<br/>
Shimazu Yoshihiro reversed it. Is this correct?<br/>
<br/>
Would Shimazu samurai and retainers bear the clan mon on their<br/>
sashimonos or their lord's personal version?<br/>
<br/>
and then there's this from the Asian War group:<br/>
<br/>
"Turnbull, in his Sourcebook (always handy) reports<br/>
<br/>
Shimazu: white mon of cross in ring on black<br/>
<br/>
Yoshihiro: short red fukinuki (hollow streamer banner) and banner of<br/>
white "ju" on black<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Retainers' mon vary according to the whim of the lord equipping them.<br/>
My impression (just that) is that more personal troops (hatamoto, etc)<br/>
would carry a particular lord's banner while more routine troops<br/>
(ashigaru) the clan. But remember, samurai retainers often carried<br/>
their own insignias!"<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
So I'm a bit lost. Am about to paint one of two Shimazu armies<br/>
(different scales) for DBA, and am wondering just which version is<br/>
correct.<br/>
<br/>
Cheers<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Shimazu specifically, I don't know. Usually it<br/>
depended on the personal loyalties of that particular<br/>
soldier--if he was a personal retainer of, say,<br/>
Iehisa, he could potentially where a device specific<br/>
to Iehisa. But more often than not it'd be a general<br/>
device. The Hojo are the best example of this, I<br/>
think--all the Hojo bigwigs used the same fish-scale<br/>
mon, in different colors to identify their<br/>
contingents. <br/>

 </span></blockquote>The standard described by Turnbull there for Yoshihiro<br/>
isn't what his soldiers wore--it was HIS personal<br/>
standard, or "Uma-jirushi". An attendant carried it,<br/>
and it marked HIS location on the battlefield, just<br/>
like Hideyoshi's Gourd Standard or Ieyasu's Golden<br/>
Fan. His retainers would wear the Shimazu mon on a<br/>
sashimono, in whatever color combination. <br/>
<br/>
Turnbull is usually really good with heraldry--I<br/>
haven't checked his book specifically on that yet, but<br/>
the stuff in the sourcebook and others is solid. <br/>

There is still some confusion over whether the Shimazu clan banner was<br/>
a black mon on white field or white on black. Could it be both?<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Could be either. Mon weren't color based, like<br/>
European heraldry. The Shimazu mon would be the<br/>
Shimazu mon whether it was black on white, white on<br/>
black, or color on color. As for how it was actually<br/>
portrayed on the battlefield, in English Turnbull is<br/>
probably your best bet. <br/>
