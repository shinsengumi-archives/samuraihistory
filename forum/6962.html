Hanzo the Razor: The Snare (1973) <br/>
<br/>
AKA: n/a<br/>
<br/>
Premise: Renegade officer Hanzo's (Shintaro Katsu) investigation of <br/>
a fouled abortion at the hands of a cult-like practitioner leads him <br/>
to a twisted S&M party hosted by a Buddhist nun and attended by a <br/>
high-ranking treasury officer he had previously insulted. As a <br/>
result of this insult, Hanzo is put on his toughest case yet, to <br/>
catch the country's most notorious thief. <br/>
<br/>
Review: Round two in the Hanzo the Razor samurai exploitation <br/>
trilogy sees Shintaro Katzu (The Tale of Zatoichi) return to the <br/>
role of a tough-as-nails police officer out to uncover corruption <br/>
with an array of fierce weaponry, torture practices and his <br/>
oversized penis with which he uses to interrogate his female <br/>
suspects into pleasured compliance. It's part gut-wrenching <br/>
chambara, part sleazy sexploitation and all live-action manga from <br/>
the creator of Lone Wolf and Cub.<br/>
<br/>
Easily-offended viewers beware. The Snare and its two companion <br/>
films are not your typical samurai movies. Filled with unrepentant <br/>
violence and sexual depravity, they are Shintaro Katsu's answer to <br/>
the popular Western exploitation films of the early '70s. And of the <br/>
three, The Snare is probably the most sensational.<br/>
<br/>
It kicks off with a bang as Hanzo and his loyal deputies chase down <br/>
a pair of petty thieves, only to end up in a tussle with samurai in <br/>
the employ of a high-ranking treasury officer. This sets Hanzo on a <br/>
collision course with trouble as he makes enemies of the officer's <br/>
samurai bodyguard and ends up having to take on the country's most <br/>
notorious thief or face the possibility of ritual suicide. Of <br/>
course, he goes about his business with his usual lack of tact and <br/>
discretion. This includes tracing a string of ritualistic abortions <br/>
to an S&M gathering at a Buddhist Temple where nuns are kidnapping <br/>
and drugging women to satisfy the sadistic pleasures of the treasury <br/>
officer and a group of business owners. Unable to prove the <br/>
officer's involvement, Hanzo tortures and pleasures the head nun <br/>
into a full confession. With his career and life at stake, Hanzo <br/>
takes on the mission to bring in the country's most dangerous <br/>
criminal, a killer and thief named Shobei Hamajima (Kei Sato). Hanzo <br/>
sets a trap at the treasury by hiding away with the female steward, <br/>
a widow he decides needs a little special attention in order to keep <br/>
her from giving his presence away when the thief arrives.<br/>
<br/>
Japan is known for creating some pretty eccentric entertainment. One <br/>
look at the adult anime and manga business will provide plenty of <br/>
examples. Even so, there is little to prepare a viewer for the Hanzo <br/>
films. The Snare is easily one of the most outrageous samurai movies <br/>
ever made and probably has more in common with Hong Kong's category <br/>
III period films like Sex and Zen than your typical samurai <br/>
actioner. Shintaro Katsu shamelessly runs around half naked through <br/>
the film, conditioning his enlarged manhood with a stick, defiling a <br/>
sack of rice with it, and jamming it into reluctant women who are <br/>
quick to call out for more. At one point, he is nearly crushing a <br/>
bald nun's legs with the weight of large bricks and the next, has <br/>
her suspended from the ceiling and spinning in delight as <br/>
he "probes" her for more information while threatening to stop.<br/>
<br/>
Katsu's "gift" to Japanese cinema is in creating a winning formula <br/>
and revisiting it over and over again without fully tapping it dry <br/>
as he did with the Zatoichi franchise. While keyed up a bit, this <br/>
film is essentially a rehash of the first, Sword of Justice. It <br/>
improves in its pacing and exploitive nature, while appearing less <br/>
of an overt rip-off of blaxploitation cinema. With a nod to the cult-<br/>
like fetishes of European trash cinema of the day and a ramping up <br/>
of topless nudity, sadist action and grizzly deaths, Katsu even more <br/>
clearly defines his exploitive take on the samurai genre. However, <br/>
its these same features that will undoubtedly turn off more <br/>
mainstream audiences whose preferences lean towards compelling <br/>
period drama and classical swordplay.<br/>
<br/>
Any way you slice it, The Snare is still just just Shintaro Katsu's <br/>
sensational attempt to cash in on a trend and neither represents the <br/>
jidei geki well nor his abilities as an action film star. Anyone not <br/>
easily offended who is looking for something out of the ordinary <br/>
might find this of interest. Typical chambara fans would be better <br/>
served by sticking with Katsu's equally exploitive, but more action-<br/>
oriented Lone Wolf and Cub films. <br/>
