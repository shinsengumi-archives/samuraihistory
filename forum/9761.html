Fourth Annual Samurai Fiction Contest, 2008<br/>
<br/>
The  parameters for the third annual Samurai Fiction contest are covered on <br/>
this  page. The stories must involve Japan or the Samurai, and the story may <br/>
take  place any time up to, but no later than the end of the 19th century, and <br/>
may  take place at any point in Japanese history before  this.<br/>
<br/>
Requirements:<br/>
<br/>
This is to be a piece of fiction writing  taking place within an unspecified <br/>
period in Japanese history up to the late  19th century. The available genres <br/>
are listed on the website, linked above -  the stories must be written in the <br/>
style of one of the genres on the  listed.<br/>
<br/>
Parameters:<br/>
<br/>
The story is required to be more than 1,000  words, with a 5,000 word <br/>
targeted limit - overages are acceptable if  necessary, but please don't overdo it. <br/>
It can be done in the first person, or  the third person, and must be a <br/>
complete short story, not an excerpt from a  larger story. The genre(s) must be <br/>
listed at the top of the story above the  title - one genre or a combination of two <br/>
genres are acceptable. Although the  particular genre will not affect <br/>
judging, all entrants must make sure that  their story follows the requirements of <br/>
their chosen genre(s) - see details on  the website listed above.<br/>
<br/>
Sequels: Sequels to previous stories entered  in the contest are acceptable - <br/>

the previous story.<br/>

closed, to avoid any  swaying of the judges. The recipient of the submissions <br/>
(The Samurai Archives  webmaster) will not be a judge, and will only moderate <br/>
the proceedings, to  keep entries anonymous. The winning story will be featured <br/>
on the Samurai  Archives site as the winner of the 2008 Samurai Fiction <br/>
