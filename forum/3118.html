<h3>Books to Read?</h3>
by <i>BMCAMP@aol.com</i>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1908079633">I would like to know if someone can recommend some good books about Samurai <br/>
history.  The only thing is they have to be in English.  I am currently reading <br/>
Legends of  the Samurai and have several books about Bushido on order by <br/>
Yamamoto Tsunetomo.  Any help would be greatly appreciated, also if there are any <br/>
good fiction books to read about Samurai, I would be interested in those also.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1352460756">For the history of the samurai, Turnbull has many titles, Samurai a Military History is my favorite.<br/>
For fiction I would recomend Taiko and Musashi, both by Eiji Yoshikawa.<br/>

  I would like to know if someone can recommend some good books about Samurai <br/>
  history.  The only thing is they have to be in English.  I am currently reading <br/>
  Legends of  the Samurai and have several books about Bushido on order by <br/>
  Yamamoto Tsunetomo.  Any help would be greatly appreciated, also if there are any <br/>
  good fiction books to read about Samurai, I would be interested in those also.<br/>
