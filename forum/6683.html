By SHUNJI MORIMOTO, The Asahi Shimbun <br/>
--------------<br/>
<br/>
A favorite word among executives and politicians, Bushido-the code <br/>
of the samurai-evokes yamato damashii (Japanese spirit) and seppuku <br/>
(ritual suicide by disembowelment). Such an association, however, <br/>
``is a mere vestige'' of the Bushido that existed for more than 700 <br/>
years up to the Meiji Restoration of 1868, stresses University of <br/>
Tokyo professor Kakumyo Kanno in his recent book ``Bushido no <br/>
Gyakushu'' (Bushido strikes back). In the paperback, published by <br/>
Kodansha, the 49-year-old professor of ethics argues that the Meiji <br/>
Restoration severed that thinking and that discontinuity served as a <br/>
remote cause of Japan's defeat in World War II. Kanno shared his <br/>
views on Bushido in a recent interview. <br/>
<br/>
Why has thinking very different from the original Bushido gained <br/>
ground, even though the word bushi (samurai) remains in the name? <br/>
<br/>
Kanno began by citing ``Bushido: the Soul of Japan,'' written in <br/>
English by Inazo Nitobe and published in the United States in 1899. <br/>
<br/>
``The Bushido spirit presented by Nitobe has nothing to do with the <br/>
thinking of the samurai. <br/>
<br/>
``The actual standpoint of the samurai is completely ignored,'' said <br/>
Kanno sharply. <br/>
<br/>
``Nitobe was a Christian who lived in the modern era. The Meiji <br/>
Restoration ended the age of the samurai. His Bushido is a modern <br/>
concept that, so to speak, could be called Meiji Bushido. Nitobe <br/>
borrowed the word Bushido to use as a link between the Japanese and <br/>
a universal Western thinking that is the same as Christian <br/>
thinking,'' said Kanno. <br/>
<br/>
Then what is the real Bushido like? <br/>
<br/>
Kanno cited three key terms-self, warrior and community. <br/>
<br/>
The beginnings of the samurai can be traced back to the 10th <br/>
century. At that time, private bands of warriors were formed after <br/>
the ritsuryo (legal code) state, which had national troops, ceased <br/>
to exist. According to Kanno, the thinking that sustained the new <br/>
bands of private soldiers was Bushido. <br/>
<br/>
Since Bushido is the thinking of private warriors, it adheres <br/>
completely to personal attachments. A warrior fights for the sake of <br/>
his independence, relying solely on his own capability. This does <br/>
not necessarily mean violence without a specific purpose. Kanno <br/>
believes that the samurai fought for his own interests, those of his <br/>
wife and children and for the community that embraced his lord. <br/>
<br/>
``To us, used to the idea of citizens within the framework of the <br/>
modern nation-state, this thinking is practically <br/>
incomprehensible.'' <br/>
<br/>
Then why does Meiji Bushido, cloaked in the Bushido shell, still <br/>
hold interest? <br/>
<br/>
To explain this, Kanno cites the fact that Bushido thinking was <br/>
previously declared a national moral code. An example is the gunjin <br/>
chokuyu, the Imperial Rescript to Soldiers and Sailors issued by <br/>
Emperor Meiji in 1882. By examining its formation, Kanno observes <br/>
that Bushido was remodeled to become a principle to control the <br/>
armed forces of a modern state. <br/>
<br/>
The leaders of the imperial army in the early days ingeniously <br/>
removed the spirit of the ``original Bushido,'' rooted in personal <br/>
attachments. And to govern the nation's army, they are said to have <br/>
created the ``yamato (Japanese) spirit'' to replace the ``original <br/>
Bushido.'' <br/>
<br/>
``Bushido is a way of thinking that was severed by the Meiji <br/>
Restoration.'' Had Bushido been correctly passed down to the <br/>
imperial army, Kanno believes, defeat in the last world war might <br/>
have been avoided since ``Bushido held the wisdom to end war.'' <br/>
<br/>
Kanno, a priest of the Soto sect of Zen Buddhism, is known for his <br/>
studies of Shinto and his research on Motoori Norinaga, a scholar of <br/>
classical culture. In addition to publishing ``Shinto no Gyakushu'' <br/>
(Shinto strikes back), Kanno addressed the topic of Yasukuni Shrine <br/>
in the January edition of Shokun! magazine. <br/>
<br/>
``Although Yasukuni Shrine is a fitting place to console the souls <br/>
of the deceased, it needs to be supplemented in its present form. It <br/>
seems all of us, politicians included, are trying to take advantage <br/>
of the fallen soldiers. We must think first of the war dead,'' said <br/>
Kanno.(IHT/Asahi: February 12,2005)</div>

" Had Bushido been correctly passed down to the <br/>
Imperial Army, defeat in the last world war might <br/>
have been avoided since Bushido held the wisdom to end war.'' <br/>
Nothing on this world could have avoided Japan's defeat but to avoid the<br/>
war in itself. At least 100 years of history should be rewrote to obtain<br/>
such a result...  <br/>
