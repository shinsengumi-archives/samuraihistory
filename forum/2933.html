<div id="ygrps-yiv-136705680">LOL.  Question: Am I correct in assuming that the top knot of which we speak <br/>
is a general part of Japan's history and not unique to either Samurai or Sumo? <br/>
 Just asking.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-2068376993">Uh, I'm talking about the hairstyle that was commonly<br/>
worn in the Tokugawa period by Samurai, I don't know<br/>
if it had a bunch of different variations or anything,<br/>
i'm not even sure if the sumo bun has any sort of<br/>
relation to it.  I'm only asking because I participate<br/>
in my own small form of Japanese recreation and I'd<br/>
like to look as authentic as possible, since I fall<br/>
way short of looking even the least bit asian.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-276447117">Craz,<br/>
	Sasama Sensei's pictorial dictionary of everyday Edo living has three <br/>
full pages of male hair styles and five of women's (25 or so per page). <br/>
Hairstyles were tied to social and economic status. So for a farmers <br/>
son to become a sumo-tori and wear the chon-mage let everyone know he <br/>
was much more than just a big country boy.<br/>
	Camelia oil and various kinds of "mousse" were employed to achieve the <br/>
various styles. For a mans top-knot, the hair was wrapped in paper or <br/>
tied with one or two strings. There is a trick to it though, it takes a <br/>
skilled hand, that is why you don't see sumo-tori doing their own hair. <br/>
There was an article in the Japan Times  a couple a years back about a <br/>
gai who wanted to wear montsuki and chon-mage to a friends wedding. <br/>
Once it was set he wore it for weeks all over Japan and I guess <br/>
parlayed it into lots of free drinks...<br/>
