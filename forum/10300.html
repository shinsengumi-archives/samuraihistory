<h3>Seals of Red and Letters of Gold - An Interview With Travis Seifman</h3>

<br/>
In this podcast, originally recorded in April 2010, Joseph (Author of the Ancient Japan Blog: http://japanesearchaeology.com) and Chris interview Travis Seifman about his recently published article Seals of Red and Letters of Gold: Japanese Relations with Southeast Asia in the 17th Century, which can be found here: http://scholarspace.manoa.hawaii.edu/handle/10125/18229.<br/>
<br/>
The paper is a version of his M.A. dissertation in Japanese Studies at the School of Oriental and African Studies, University of London, and it concerns Japan's diplomacy and trade with Southeast Asia during the 17th century.<br/>
<br/>
Starting next week we'll roll out the new podcast with the new format, and we'll be tackling the subject of the legendary battle of Nagashino - how many guns, what really happened, and does Takeda Katsuyori really deserve the reputation of "worst commander of the Sengoku"?  Stay tuned!</div>
