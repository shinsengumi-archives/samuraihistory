<h3>Book recommendations for Sengoku provinces</h3>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-690549103">Hi,<br/>
<br/>
I'm looking for any suggestions folks might have for books displaying <br/>
detailed maps of the Sengoku provinces. Such maps hopefully show <br/>
major (and minor) settlements, fortresses and castles, rivers and <br/>
other prominent topography. The map(s) provided with the game system <br/>
are in my view, while helpful as a start, rather lacking in detail. <br/>
I've found some maps along the lines of what I'm looking for in some <br/>
of the Osprey books (i.e. Sekigahara, Kawanakajima, Nagashino, etc.), <br/>
but I was really hoping to find yet more detail over a larger area if <br/>
possible. I'm even open to primary sources in the original Japanese <br/>
if anyone knows of such books by name. Thanks,<br/>
<br/>
