well, this was my introduction to the group, i just signed up yesterday.<br/>
Anyways imho everyones making  big deal of nuthing and if it were explained<br/>
at first that such comparisons are dificult to make, we may have been able<br/>
to avoid this whole ordeal.<br/>
<br/>
One interesting point though that i think deserves mention (if some more<br/>
educated members of the forum are already aware of this then i apologize for<br/>
stating the obvious) is that as most of us know the word samurai means to<br/>
serve and is derived from some japanese verb (i am not aware of the<br/>
specifics) while the word "knight" comes from the german "knecht" meaning<br/>
servant. Just one of the many similarites between the european knight and<br/>
their japanese counterparts. I kinda like to think of them as different<br/>
interpretations of the same thing.<br/>
