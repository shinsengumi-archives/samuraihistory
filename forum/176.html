<h3>lack of updates</h3>
by <i>Christopher West</i>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1677477334">Here's an FYI to any and all wondering why there is a conspicuous <br/>
lack of updates to the Samurai Archives page - we are currently in <br/>
the process of putting a book together - with plans for a second <br/>
within the next two years, contents of which are temporarily top <br/>
secret.  The amount of translating involved, as well as school, <br/>
family and work obligations takes away from any real time to make any <br/>
major updates to the page.  We are looking at a publishing date of <br/>
sometime in the future within the last 4 - 5 months of this year, but <br/>
don't have a solid timetable down.  Anyway, the one publisher we have <br/>
been looking at has a [hopefully] temporary hold on new manuscripts <br/>
until they catch up on an apparently large backlog of books that are <br/>
waiting to be published.  At the very least, we intend to keep <br/>
the 'Samurai of the Week'  changed each week, and keep this list <br/>
moderated (so don't worry if it takes a day or two for one of us to <br/>
approve a message).  Anyway, somewhat on topic - since updates from <br/>
us may not be too forthcoming on the page for a while, if there is <br/>
anyone out there who wants to put together some 'samurai desktop <br/>
wallpaper' for us to put on the 'downloads' page, or even create <br/>
some 'samurai' related 'skins' for games such as "the sims", "half-<br/>
life", etc.,  email me off the list (especially the sims!)  at <br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="mailto:kitsuno@...">kitsuno@...</a> and we'll see about adding them to <br/>
our 'downloads' section.<br/>
