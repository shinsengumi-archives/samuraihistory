<h3>newcomer with a new question</h3>
by <i>mgiard2002</i>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-2043444269">Konnichi wah everyone!<br/>
<br/>
   I'm new to the list. Let me introduce myself. My name is Martin, <br/>
I'm from Quebec City, Canada. I've done a couple of different <br/>
japanese martial arts in the last 15 years. I stopped for a while but <br/>
I'm about to return to it. I'm also in the SCA ans as you probably <br/>
suspect, my persona is japanese. My SCA name is Fukushima Masanari <br/>
Hanzo, a late Heian imperial guard. <br/>
   Now the question.<br/>
   I'm searching about some kind of ceremonial "passing of power", or <br/>
any info about how the samurai daimyo steps down and how daimyo were <br/>
promoted, etc. In fact, we have a small japanese household here and <br/>
the leader is stepping down and want to give the power to someone <br/>
else. We would like to do it the more authentic possible. I know that <br/>
sometimes a Daimyo takes over a household by killing the former <br/>
ruler, but we are searching about something more peaceful. <br/>
<br/>
   Than you very much about your future advices.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1848346000">I'm unfamiliar with the actual ceremony, but I believe it involves the former <br/>
Daimyo shaving his head and taking the vows of a buddhist priest.<br/>
