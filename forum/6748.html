<div id="ygrps-yiv-2090264527">Hi Gillian!<br/>
 <br/>
As we know, it was Tokugawa Ieyasu who ordered the killing of Christians in Japan. One of his victims is a Filipino, named Lorenzo Ruiz, who travelled with Catholic priests, after escaping Spanish injustice back in the Philippines. <br/>
 <br/>
Lorenzo and his companions were caught doing Catholic missions in Japan. Before and during torture Ieyasu made an offer, "renounce their faith and they wil be spared". The missionaries did not accept the offer except for one who was also killed later on.<br/>
 <br/>
Lorenzo and his group were tortured using water poured in their mouth using a funnel while torturers put a plank of wood on their stomachs as they see-sawed on in. Needles were stuck between the fingernails and the flesh. <br/>
 <br/>
When no one gave up, Ieyasu ordered the missionaries to be hung upside down in separate wells. the wells' mouth was then closed as the prisoners hung. Most of the group, including Lorenzo perished after ten days. They were taken out of the well, beheaded, burned, and their ashes scattered to the sea.<br/>
 <br/>
Lorenzo Ruiz was beatified by Pope John Paul II in the early 1980s for being a layman in a group of priests yet did not renounce his faith.<br/>
 <br/>
He is now known as Saint Lorenzo Ruiz after His cannonization in Vatican by the Pope in the the early 1990s.<br/>
 <br/>
Tokugawa Ieyasu really enforced his laws and policies. <br/>

authorized the purge. Please someone correct me if I err.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-2077180687"><blockquote><span title="ireply">>   Ieyasu first authorised  persecution by ordering all missionaries to <br/>
 </span></blockquote>leave in 1614. Hidetada was officially shogun by now (1605-23) but <br/>
Ieyasu still dominated policy until his death in 1616 (and intended to <br/>
carry on doing so afterwards in spirit). So the  executions of 1622, <br/>
came after Ieyasu's death and were authorised by Hidetada, but were a <br/>
follow-up to Ieyasu's policy and intentions. This fierce anti-Christian <br/>
policy continued under Iemitsu (1623-51), by which time most <br/>
Christians had been killed, had recanted, or gone underground in <br/>
remote villages in Kyushu.<br/>
<br/>
I got the gist of this from McClain: A Modern History of Japan.  McClain <br/>
says as many as 4,000 died,<br/>
<br/>
If whoever started this thread is still reading: to compare and contrast <br/>
Tokugawa Ieyasu and Lee Kwan Yew would make an interesting topic!<br/>
<br/>
