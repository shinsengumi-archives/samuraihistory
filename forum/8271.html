<h3>Gaming the samurai period - Killer Katanas</h3>
by <i>bbradf3021</i>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1267009690">Hello all,<br/>
<br/>
My name is Brian Bradford and I am the author of a set of wargame <br/>
rules that will allow a person to recreate the battles of Sengoku <br/>
Japan with model soldiers.  The rules are called Killer Katanas 2.  <br/>
<br/>
The original edition was published back in 1995 and I have just <br/>
recently published an improved second version of the book.  The rules <br/>
were developed using the latest information at my disposal with the <br/>
assistance of samurai authors Terje Solumn and Dr. Stephen Turnbull.  <br/>
So popular was the first edition of the rules that they were used as <br/>
a reference for the Electronic Arts PC game "Shogun: Total War".<br/>
<br/>
The goal of KK2 is to allow larger battles of the samurai to be <br/>
fought.  Included in the 120+ page book is army lists and rules for <br/>
clans so that a player can recreate their favorite Daimyo's army on <br/>
the tabletop, game uses for 22 tactical battle formations, ability <br/>
ratings for over 500 Daimyo, siege rules, a points system for <br/>
designing armies and battles, a scenario generator and 10 historical <br/>
battle scenarios: 4th Kawanakajima, 2nd Konodai, Mimasetoge, <br/>
Nunobeyama, Anegawa, Mikatagahara, Nagashino, Okitanawate, Hitotori <br/>
Bridge and Sekigahara.<br/>
<br/>
The rules are laser printed on high-quality paper and are spiral <br/>
bound with a glossy cover depicting a scene from the Battle of <br/>
Tennoji.  Even if you are not a gamer the book is full of information <br/>
and contains many items never before printed in the English language.<br/>
<br/>
If you are interested in a copy you can get one at Amazon.com by <br/>
doing a search for "Killer Katanas," or you can order it direct from <br/>
me by sending an email to <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="mailto:BBradford1973@...">BBradford1973@...</a>.  The cost of each <br/>
book is $35 plus postage.  I can accept paypal.<br/>
<br/>
Arrigato!<br/>
