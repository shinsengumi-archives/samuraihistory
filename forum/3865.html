<div id="ygrps-yiv-122972808">Konnichi wa minna!!! <br/>
I'm not sure if this question has already been asked I suppose IO <br/>
should have cheaked really.... um... anyway I was just wondering if <br/>
there was anyone out there who knew the true history behind the movie <br/>
The Last Samurai like the real Samurai who took part in the movie... <br/>
or a site where I could get the information off... I love Japan and I <br/>
really love the culture I've been reading about Samurai for sometime <br/>
know and I found out quite a bit about the whole westernised Japan <br/>
and stuff but I want to know MORE especially after seeing the <br/>
movie... which I love no matter what anyone says! I think it was a <br/>
really good depiction... if anyone wants to bitch about a really <br/>
crappy movie involving Japan watch Lost In Translation! It the worst! <br/>
Anyhoo.... hope someone can answer my question or help me out.... <br/>

 </span></blockquote>I believe the samurai in question is Saigo Takamori.  I could be wrong.  <br/>
Please correct me if I am.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>For a really good summary on Saigo Takamori's disenchantment with and rebellion against the Meiji government (which he had been instrumental in forming) read  A Modern History of Japan by James L McClain. WW Norton and Co 2002. pp164-168. <br/>
<br/>
(Of course, you could read the whole book!And Kanazawa: A Seventeenth Century Japanese Castle Town by the same author, which is also brilliant)</div>

There are better books on Saigo Takamori than that. Try<br/>
<br/>
Biographies of Saigo:<br/>
The Last Samurai by Mark Ravina<br/>
Saigo Takamori by Charles Yates<br/>
Great Saigo by Sakamoto Moriaki (old and outdated)<br/>
for the Satsuma Rebellion see:<br/>
The Satsuma Rebellion by Augustus Mounsey</div>
