<h3>Masashige Kusunoki</h3>
by <i>midorinotoradesu</i>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-657717585">Let me 1st say that the wealth of knowledge available in this group <br/>
never ceases to amaze me.  I've been a member of the group for about <br/>
3 years now (although I don't post many messages) and I am always <br/>
surprised by the members of this group.  Not only do we have the <br/>
great Anthony J. Bryant, but Nate Ledbetter, Kitsuno, Tom Helm, Cepo, <br/>
and Prof Letham are all experts that I am honored to learn from. I <br/>
read the daily digest sent to my home email with great anticipation.   <br/>
Thank you all (there are many that I did not mention).  This is the <br/>
best group on the web.<br/>
<br/>
On with my question.  It has 2 parts.  <br/>
First, I have seen some famous statue photos of Masashige Kusunoki.  <br/>
It is a huge bronze statue of the man, powerfully posed, on a huge <br/>
horse.  It seems to capture a strength that not many other statues of <br/>
this type reveal.  I'd like to see it myself but I don't know where <br/>
it is at.  I'm living in Tokyo, and I know it's somewhere around <br/>
here.  Anyone know exactly where it is?<br/>
Second, does anyone who has visited the statue have other pictures of <br/>
it?  I'd like to get a small collection of photos so that I can make <br/>
a painting.  The staue would be a reference for the horse mainly but <br/>
I'd like to capture the strength of the samurai in it as well.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks again.<br/>

Cepo was correct. Its in front of the Imperial Palace in Tokyo. The area is<br/>
called "Kogo Mae Hiroba".<br/>
<br/>
I don't have any pics of it myself but there are some in Kodansha's Saigen<br/>

 </span></blockquote>I can show you, if you'd like. I live in Yoyogi. The<br/>
statue is right next to the Imperial Palace in the<br/>
Akasaka area. I don't have my guidebook handy right<br/>
now (at work) to point out the exact subway stop, but<br/>
I was there about 2 weeks ago with a military tour<br/>
group--we went there and to the Boeicho headquarters<br/>
at Ichigaya (the Japanese Pentagon). If you follow the<br/>
directions to get to the Palace, it's right there next<br/>
to the bathroom/omiyage store/restaurant. Pretty cool<br/>
statue, too.<br/>

yet to be shipped from the US. But as I said, if<br/>
you're in Tokyo go yourself and take as many pics as<br/>
you want! Email me off list if you would like to get<br/>
together at all for me to show you.<br/>

<h3>Bakumatsu questions</h3>
by <i>ltdomer98</i>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1719169323">All--<br/>
<br/>
Okay, I'm reading Conrad Totman's "The Collapse of the<br/>
Tokugawa Bakufu, 1862-1868" and so far it's pretty<br/>
illuminating about the end of the Bakufu. As it picks<br/>
up the story in 1862, I'm a little fuzzy on some<br/>
background information that I was hoping someone here<br/>
could help me with. <br/>
<br/>
1. The Court seems to have had quite a large<br/>
influence, especially with pro-Joi sentiment, and<br/>
clearly gives orders to the Bakufu in 1862/1863<br/>
regarding expelling the foreigners in Japan. How/When<br/>
did the Court gain the power to give orders to the<br/>
Bakufu? I realize that the power was always there, so<br/>
to speak, but the court hadn't done anything political<br/>
since Go-Daigo and the Nambokucho. Where did this<br/>
Court resurgence come from?<br/>
<br/>
2. Same question re: Shishi. Totman talks about the<br/>
Shishi and the fact that many came from Choshuu and<br/>
Mito. Why all of a sudden were ronin all over the<br/>
place, and particularly from these two places? Did<br/>
Mori Yoshichika have a problem governing his han<br/>
(Nagato/Choshuu) that necessitated letting go of<br/>
samurai? I'm particularly confused about this. <br/>
<br/>
3. I know I probably just haven't gotten to it yet,<br/>
but so far (I'm in 1864) the main players are bakufu<br/>
officials, Tozama daimyo like Shimazu Hisamitsu and<br/>
Mori, and the Court nobles. Where do these people<br/>
disappear to, and how come when we get to the actual<br/>
restoration the main players are people like Saigo<br/>
Takamori (a retainer of the Shimazu, if I'm correct)<br/>
and Sakamoto Ryoma and so forth? Where do the daimyo<br/>
disappear to? I understand the bakufu officials--of<br/>
course they get defeated or pushed aside or whatever.<br/>
But if, for instance, Saigo Takamori is a retainer of<br/>
Shimazu Hisamitsu, where is the break that he no<br/>
longer is a retainer and is directly working<br/>
towards/for Meiji restoration? <br/>
<br/>
I know it's a lot, thanks for your patience. I'm just<br/>
frustrated right now--NHK is a 10 min walk from my<br/>
house, yet I can't seem to get it on my TV! No<br/>
Shinsengumi for me, sadly!!! <br/>

<br/>
I think most of it came when the Bakufu asked the court what do when Perry<br/>
came. It kind of threw the ball to the court and allowed certain court<br/>
nobles and certain anti-bakufu Daimyo (namely Mito han) to start asserting<br/>
court prerogative. This came on the heels of several decades of Kokugaku<br/>
where several scholars in the late Tokugawa (Mabuchi, Norinaga,etc) were<br/>
pressing for the return of power to the throne or a least to themselves as<br/>
representatives of the throne.<br/>
<br/>
<<2. Same question re: Shishi. Totman talks about the<br/>

<br/>
Some of this had to do with the economic conditions of the time. The Tempo<br/>
years saw a lot of budget tightening in the hans and a lot of lower samurai<br/>
were set free. It also came as a result of many lower samurai releasing<br/>
themselves from the restrictive hans out of frustration that they couldn't<br/>
advance. Sakamoto Ryoma was a perfect example of this.<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
Of course they were active at this time. Conrads book is told mainly from<br/>
the bakufu perspective so it looks like they aren't there but they are. The<br/>
bakumatsu period had many actors working at the same time all over Japan.<br/>

	I'll try my hand at this, hoping any mistakes will be picked up by <br/>
others. I'll to keep it short as well.<br/>
	In 1853 the American intrusion forced the Bakufu to call on all it's <br/>
resources for an answer to the "foreign question." One of the things <br/>
they chose to do was to petition the Court and the Tozama Daimyo, <br/>
hoping that some brilliant solution or at least some consensus might <br/>
result. Instead it was a message to the entire country that the Bakufu <br/>
was crippled and powerless. The Court took a decisive albeit short <br/>
sighted stand against foreign intercourse, which much of the country <br/>
supported, starting a shift of power from Edo to Kyoto.<br/>
	Prior to the 1850's Mito was a hotbed of Kokugaku, "Japanese History", <br/>
and where in their scheme of things greater loyalty was owed the <br/>
Emperor than the Shogun, even though they were a house in line for the <br/>
Shogunate. In fact it was Mito Komon who "discovered" Kusunoki <br/>
Masashige, located his grave and made him a national hero.<br/>
	In Choshu Yoshida Shoin was preaching an anti-foreign and pro-Court <br/>
message that took hold among the young men of his Han. In Han all over <br/>
the Japan of the time politically active young men had two choices, <br/>
stay within their han and advocate for reform or leave and head to <br/>
Kyoto or Edo and try their hand there. In some cases out of deference <br/>
to their lords they became ronin, or they had no other choice if they <br/>
were to travel to the capitol and take part in the action.<br/>
	Some Daimyo were unable or unwilling to act, others maintained a level <br/>
of "plausible deniability" by fostering opposing factions within their <br/>
han. Thus if their advocates failed they could disown them, or swing <br/>
the whole han over to the successful policy. Therefore the Lord could <br/>
be seen to be acting thru his more radical subordinates, while assuring <br/>
his old guard that nothing would change. Of course this was a policy <br/>
that put extraordinary power in the hands of mid-level samurai. Beyond <br/>
that I'll be spoiling the story so, enjoy...<br/>

was his PHD dissertation. Pretty nifty one, I might<br/>
add. Though I was a little disappointed (given my<br/>
background) that there wasn't really coverage of any<br/>
actual WARFARE...only the politics behind it. As I'm a<br/>
government/IR guy, that was interesting, but as a<br/>
military man I would have liked to get more detail in<br/>
the actual tactical fighting, even if it was just<br/>
"I'll burn your mansion on Rokujo, then you burn mine<br/>
on Nijo". <br/>

Off hand I recall some of them became governors of the prefectures that<br/>
their domains became (though most of those didn't last too long in that<br/>
post). All of them got a lump sum salary from the Meiji. Most used this to<br/>
invest back into state enterprises (which was what was intended) and became<br/>
very rich and managed to live comfortably on that. Also they were given<br/>
various ranks in the new peerage. I don' recall any that contributed<br/>
anything significant in the Meiji era. Most daimyo of the bakumatsu era were<br/>
not exactly to smart. Hence the reasons their kerai mostly ran the show.</div>

 </span></blockquote>The Choshu shishi were not usually ronin. They were still operating within the rule of their han. Choshu like all the great han maintained yashiki in Kyoto and Edo where young men were sent to learn sword fighting, other military subjects, Dutch learning and foreign languages. At one stage the Choshu Edo yashiki, the Yubikan was run by Katsura, later Kido Koin, a pupil of Yoshida Shoin, and a high ranking official in the han.<br/>
<br/>
Han education I think is important here. Choshu's Meirinkan in Hagi is famous: as well as all the martial arts, strategy, tactics and so on, classical learning, confucianism, and ethics were taught here. Inoue Kaoru was a typical pupil: he also attended Shoin's school at the same time. His family upbringing was extremely frugal and hardworking, yet he was of sufficiently high rank to be employed in the Mori family's service, was sent to Edo to learn rangaku and then to England to study English, was a close friend of Takasugi Shinsaku and so became a shotai leader, could speak English and so like Ito (another close friend) became involved in the negotiations after the war with the 4 Countries. Yet he was never a ronin, everything he did was with the permission of his han, though against the bakufu's rulings.<br/>
<br/>
So the shishi came from a dynamic social culture, not the stagnation that "sakoku" is often depicted as. They rose in the same way young people of ability do anywhere, through a mixture of their own talents, their education and friendships, the circumstances of the time and luck.<br/>
<br/>
Han politics, as Tom says, swung from the conservatives (in Choshu the zokuronha) who supported the bakufu and were in favour of 'open country' (ironically -they are far closer to what we would consider 'liberal' now) and the 'loyalists' (seigiha) who supported the emperor and wanted to expel foreigners. The Mori daimyo, Takachika, vacillated between the two. He was not a strong character (with the exception of Hisamitsu, few of the daimyo were at this stage: Ernest Satow in A Diplomat in Japan blames their education and uprbinging), but the feeling in Choshu was that if action were to be taken against the bakufu the house of Mori had to be involved (still lingering resentment towards the Tokugawa after Sekigahara!), but not to the extent that the Mori should be destroyed. Far more important in han politics, including protection and mentorship of the shishi, were the top bureaucrats like Sufu Masanosuke.<br/>
<br/>
Takachika retired after the restoration and handed leadership of the family over to his son. he died in the 4th year of Meiji. The Mori residence at Hofu was built for the family later in the Meiji period, but I think it illustrates the decline of the daimyo families very well. (In an earlier post I said Mori was called sansei - in fact I've looked at my notes now and the phrase was souseikou, because this was all he ever aid in meetings: sorry about that.<br/>
<br/>
Just one thing to add, am trying to keep this short. Ii Naosuke's policies during the Ansei purges when many bakufu opponents were executed aroused massive resentment among the han bushi. If Ii had lived his strength of character and ruthlessness might have saved the bakufu, his assassination by Mito men in 1860 is probably one of the many turning points in this period.<br/>
