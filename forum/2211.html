Cutting it close<br/>
Makers of 'Last Samurai' do their work<br/>
<br/>
By GIOVANNI FAZIO<br/>
<br/>
A line of infantrymen hesitantly peer off into the misty woods <br/>
they're traversing -- a murmur of sound has them spooked. These straw-<br/>
hatted, musket-bearing soldiers represent the new, "modern" army of <br/>
Emperor Meiji, and they're led by American Civil War veteran Capt. <br/>
Nathan Aldren. But they're about to get a lesson in good, old-<br/>
fashioned shock and awe. <br/>
War cries and the sound of thundering hooves rise from the <br/>
mist. "Samurai," mutter the infantrymen, their eyes darting around in <br/>
panic. Aldren tries to maintain fire-discipline, hoping to unleash a <br/>
volley just as the mounted warriors are upon them. But as the enemy <br/>
horsemen rush headlong into his line, his men break, scatter and run, <br/>
and are slaughtered to a man. All except Aldren, who is taken <br/>
prisoner. <br/>
This is the first glimpse the world got of the new Tom Cruise <br/>
project, "The Last Samurai," a few scenes from which were unveiled at <br/>
a press conference at Roppongi Hills last week. Shot in Japan (Himeji <br/>
and Kyoto), New Zealand and a Warner backlot in Los Angeles, "The <br/>
Last Samurai" -- which will open in December -- is a $100 million <br/>
Hollywood attempt to make a Japanese jidaigeki (period drama) with <br/>
the impact of "Gladiator" or "Braveheart." Cruise and director Edward <br/>
Zwick turned up with nearly all the Japanese cast -- jidaigeki <br/>
regulars like Ken Watanabe, Shun Sugata and the supercool Hiroyuki <br/>
Sanada, as well as kabuki actor Shichinosuke Nakamura and <br/>
model/actress Koyuki -- to hype the first major Hollywood-does-Japan <br/>
flick since 1993's "Rising Sun." <br/>
Cinemagoers who remember that film -- as well as dreck like "Black <br/>
Rain" and "Pearl Harbor" -- know that American directors rarely <br/>
manage to get Japan right, with awkward mannerisms and speech <br/>
patterns, and costumes that invariably leave Japanese audiences <br/>
feeling bewildered. It's easy to imagine "The Last Samurai" marching <br/>
off the same cliff of cultural miscomprehension, but despite the <br/>
storyline's similarities to the television miniseries "Shogun" -- <br/>
bearded gaijin is enlisted by enemy samurai warriors; slowly <br/>
acclimates and falls for demure, kimono-clad beauty; then suffers <br/>
from torn loyalties -- it seems the filmmakers have done everything <br/>
possible to get their on-screen Japan right. <br/>
Director Zwick is a history buff and a stickler for detail, and it <br/>
shows. Actor after actor attested to the production's deep commitment <br/>
to research and accuracy. Ken Watanabe, who plays a rebellious <br/>
samurai modeled on Takamori Saigo -- who fought to the bitter end <br/>
against the Meiji administration's centralization and modernization --<br/>
 admits he had doubts when he first read the script. "Most of the <br/>
staff were American, British or New Zealanders, and there were hardly <br/>
any Japanese except for a few advisers," he said. "Right from the <br/>
beginning, I spoke with Sanada-san, and we agreed that we would speak <br/>
up if there were any points that didn't feel right. But that turned <br/>
out to be unnecessary; the filmmakers had a very deep understanding <br/>
of the samurai." <br/>
Sanada added that there were some compromises "between reality and <br/>
entertainment, between making it authentically Japanese and <br/>
comprehensible to audiences overseas," but said, "I'm proud of the <br/>
results." Masato Harada noted that there's certainly nothing as wince-<br/>
inducing as when the Emperor off-handedly says "Domo!" to Richard <br/>
Chamberlain in "Shogun." <br/>
Certainly, the film looks right, from its massive temples and rustic <br/>
villages, to floral kimono and antiquated yoroi armor. One point of <br/>
concern, naturally, is Cruise's attempts to deliver dialogue in <br/>
Japanese: A brief scene with Koyuki, however, revealed language <br/>
skills that, however basic, sound better than many foreigners who've <br/>
been here for a few years. Cruise handles the scene with an <br/>
appropriate awkwardness, putting to shame the incomprehensible <br/>
nihongo of Sean Connery -- playing an "old Japan hand" -- in "Rising <br/>
Sun." <br/>
When it comes to swordfighting, the staple of any chanbara flick, <br/>
Cruise is utterly convincing. "I trained for eight months prior to <br/>
shooting the film, and I put on 20 pounds [9 kg] for the movie, to be <br/>
able to carry the swords and wear the armor," said Cruise. "But it <br/>
was great, because as I was developing the character, my body was <br/>
changing and I was becoming more and more like Aldren." Sanada, who <br/>
along with Watanabe tutored Cruise in the finer points of swordplay, <br/>
said simply: "He's really tough. No matter how many hours we filmed <br/>
each day, he'd still want to do one or two hours of training <br/>
afterward. I did give him a little advice regarding Japanese kenjutsu <br/>
(swordfighting), but whatever I told him, he'd absorb it right away. <br/>
And as he got better, his stance became centered lower, and he really <br/>
started to look like a samurai." <br/>
Perhaps the greatest praise for Cruise's immersion in his role came <br/>
from Sugata, who's had a decades-long career in jidaigeki as the <br/>
kirareyaku, the "guy who gets slashed." Said Sugata: "I was doubtful <br/>
that Americans could really do swordfighting, but they had studied it <br/>
in depth, they had seen all the Kurosawa films, so the American staff <br/>
were even telling Sanada and me what to do! I was really impressed by <br/>
Tom Cruise. I mean, sure, he'd practiced, but I know from 40 years of <br/>
experience that if you just practice for a couple of months, you <br/>
can't do it right, but he was perfect. I could feel the passion and <br/>
commitment he put into this film." <br/>
Sugata went on to say that "The Last Samurai" would be a wake-up call <br/>
to the Japanese film industry that had regarded chanbara as a <br/>
domestic specialty. "Now I feel we just can't sit back and assume <br/>
it's our specialty, because no Japanese film has done this so well." <br/>
Obviously, the film is a canny move for Cruise, who knows on which <br/>
side his bread is buttered; the actor has a huge following in Japan --<br/>
 witness even Prime Minister Junichiro Koizumi angling for a photo-op <br/>
with him -- and, sure enough, he'll be back in December for the <br/>
opening to give it another push. Beyond that, the post-"Crouching <br/>
Tiger" (and "Matrix") mini-boom in Asian action seems to still be on <br/>
the upswing, although it remains to be seen if fans of the fantastic, <br/>
looney-tunes fights of Hong Kong cinema will go for the gritty <br/>
realism of "The Last Samurai," which largely avoids computer-graphic <br/>
effects. <br/>
But beyond that, Cruise -- a Scientologist who neither drinks nor <br/>
smokes and who has increasingly taken on physically demanding roles --<br/>
 seems genuinely fascinated by Bushido and the "Hagakure," the way of <br/>
the warrior. <br/>
"Bushido is really the reason I wanted to make this film," said <br/>
Cruise. "I strongly identify with those values of honor, loyalty and <br/>
passion. It's a very powerful code; those are wonderful things to <br/>
aspire to in a life." <br/>
OK, so perhaps he's laying it on a bit thick. But for an actor who <br/>
got by for so long on pure charm, he's certainly willed himself into <br/>
a more mature performer, with depth and gravity, in films <br/>
like "Magnolia," "Minority Report" and "Vanilla Sky." Here's <br/>
hoping "The Last Samurai" shows him at his best.</div>

<br/>
Overall, encouraging articles, Kitsuno, but the above<br/>
still worries me. Though it's more appropriate for the<br/>
timeframe than say, if he was doing a Will Adams take,<br/>
I'm just hoping we don't get overwhelmed with Hagakure<br/>
honor-garbage. <br/>
<br/>
Still, the articles do make me feel somewhat<br/>
better--at least they TRIED to get things right, and<br/>
if Watanabe Ken signs off on it...<br/>
