<br/>
success, samurai code<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Boye Lafayette De Mente'sfirst book, on the etiquette and ethics of <br/>
doing business in Japan, is such a classic that it sold like crazy <br/>
and is now in its sixth edition. <br/>
<br/>
Forty-six years later, the Paradise Valley resident and Japan expert <br/>
has added to his string of books with The Japanese Samurai Code: <br/>
Classic Strategies for Success,due out this spring from Boston-based <br/>
Tuttle Publishing Co. Inc.<br/>
<br/>
In the new book, De Mente details nearly 40traits of the samurai <br/>
that he says have shaped present-day Japanese thinking and behavior.<br/>
<br/>
"In my judgment, it was the influence of the samurai class over 800 <br/>
years that molded the common Japanese into what they are today," De <br/>
Mente said.<br/>
<br/>
Foremost among the samurai traits, De Mente says, are perseverance, <br/>
diligence, obsession with detail and obsession with quality.<br/>
<br/>
Such traits were instilled early in samurai clans. Boys began sword <br/>
training at age 7, and for the next eight years underwent extensive <br/>
physical and mental training before they could be recognized as <br/>
samurai. <br/>
<br/>
The closest American parallel, De Mente says, might be the Navy <br/>
SEALs or other specialized units in which young participants are <br/>
trained for years under extreme challenges and high expectations.<br/>
<br/>
A samurai had to win to be able to survive, and the samurai class <br/>
put that kind of intensity into its training of other Japanese, he <br/>
said.<br/>
<br/>
"When you transfer that to business, it becomes a very powerful <br/>
motive for success," he said. <br/>
<br/>
And since the bubble burst on Japan's economy about 15 years ago, <br/>
regaining the samurai spirit has been a common topic of discussion <br/>
and concern there, De Mente said.<br/>
<br/>
"The older Japanese recognize that if they lose more of the samurai <br/>
code, then Japan is in for trouble," he said. "Without that <br/>
attitude, they're just going to be another kid on the block."<br/>
<br/>
Even given the emergence of China and India, De Mente counts Japan <br/>
as down but definitely not out of the economic picture. Japan is <br/>
still the world's second-largest economy, and it is very good at <br/>
research and is making breakthroughs in vital areas such as biology <br/>
and materials, he said.<br/>
<br/>
Japan was Arizona's eight-largest market in 2003, taking $466 <br/>
million in exports from the state.<br/>
<br/>
De Mente graduated from Jochi University in Tokyo and lived in Japan <br/>
for more than 20 years. Now 76 years old, he still returns two to <br/>
four times a year to the country that has become his life's work.<br/>
<br/>
"I encourage people to study the cultural history of countries <br/>
they're interested in," he said. "Without that insight, it is <br/>
extremely difficult to be communicating on the same channel."<br/>
