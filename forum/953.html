<h3>mon identification</h3>
by <i>zykr</i>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-2097098180">Hello!<br/>
<br/>
I have a Wakizashi with edo period fittings, and there are two mon on<br/>
these fittings. One is the kiri mon in silver, and the other neither<br/>
I, nor anyone else, has been able to identify. <br/>
<br/>
I'm very interested in finding out what it could be, as it will<br/>
possibly shed some light on who owned this beautiful sword.<br/>
<br/>
The mon is here:<br/>
<br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.geocities.com/zykr/mon.jpg">http://www.geocities.com/zykr/mon.jpg</a><br/>
<br/>
The followup question is in a situation like this, where a piece of<br/>
property or clothing is marked with two mon, what does this imply?<br/>
<br/>
Is the first a family crest, and the second perhaps one for an individual?<br/>
<br/>
Thanks!</div>

<br/>
Hard ones first eh!!  The Mon is catagorised as "Meyui" (=Eyes). I must<br/>
admit to not having seen a 3x3 diamond in a circle before. However, there<br/>
are similar mons 3x2 from the "Horio" family, 2x2 from the "Tsuchihashi"<br/>
family or So [line over o] family and a 3x4 from the "Muto[line over o],<br/>
Nose or Shoni" families. Best I can do at present.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1859903656">Meyui represents a style of dying, a pattern left on cloth, popular in the<br/>
nara period and revived in the Edo period. This mon and it's variations are<br/>
usually seen as a block of four, or sixteen. My reference gives like 70<br/>
families that used it or a variation.<br/>
    These mon questions come up on the sword forums often; I believe it was<br/>
John Yumoto who said that to identify a family from mon you needed three<br/>
mon. The mon of the lord and or the main house of the family, the family mon<br/>
or variation which represented the particular branch and the mon of the<br/>
wifes family. Thus we can see Satsuma Koshirae with the cross in circle mon,<br/>
kiri mon and Aoi mon all in one. As a daughter of the Daimyo was adopted to<br/>
a noble family in Kyoto picked up the Kiri and then was wed to the Tokugawa<br/>
picking up the Aoi mon and thus her sons and his cousins back in Satsuma<br/>
could sport all three.<br/>
    And I would point out once we get into the Meiji period no rules were<br/>
followed and any mon might be used by any family. In the end I think it is<br/>
near impossible to identify a family by mon without some other evidence.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>I have seen references to the other variations before, but never <br/>
this one. I'm hoping in that it is unusual, it would be easier to <br/>
narrow down.<br/>

The koshirae here do date to the 1700s though, so hopefully that <br/>
would eliminate the Meiji stuff.<br/>
<br/>
And then 2/3 would hopefully narrow it down to a set of choices...<br/>
<br/>
Thank you both for your help!</div>

 </span></blockquote>Alittle slow on the response but if you have a history like when and where it<br/>
was bought/captured. What other elements are part of the koshirae, what is the<br/>
sword in the scabbard? surrender tags, polishers marks, sayagaki, saya makers<br/>
notes, etc...<br/>
    All of which still make it a long shot.<br/>
