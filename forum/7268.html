Big news on the anime front: Spike TV sent out a press release <br/>
recently that Samuel L. Jackson will produce and voice the hotly <br/>
anticipated five episode anime series Afro Samurai with Japanese <br/>
anime studio Gonzo and Fuji Television. <br/>
<br/>
The tale spins around a black samurai, Afro, to be voiced by <br/>
Jackson, who is on a quest to avenge his father's death, <br/>
meeting "enemies, friends and challenges along the way". Hopefully <br/>
the series will be more original than the storyline of "antisocial <br/>
warrior avenging the wrongful death of his (insert relative of your <br/>
choice here)".  Jackson overflows with talent on the big screen, but <br/>
Afro Samurai will need to pack a lot more punch than its initial <br/>
press release to stand out in the anime crowd, even with his gravely <br/>
voice bringing life to the lead role.<br/>
<br/>
The series blends samurai style with hip-hop, something the Spike TV <br/>
folks claim in their press release "American audiences have never <br/>
seen before". Guess the Spike TV guys haven't been keeping up with <br/>
Shinichiro Watanabe's latest effort, Samurai Champloo.</div>
