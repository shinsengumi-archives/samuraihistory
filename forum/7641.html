<h3>Romantic Edoites went both ways</h3>

<br/>
As in other historical periods, Japanese in the Edo era (1601-1868) <br/>
engaged in sex. (We can verify this assertion, needless to say, from <br/>
evidence of their continued existence.) Such activities were, as <br/>
historian Mikito Ujiie writes in Shincho 45 (September), both <br/>
procreative and recreational.<br/>
<br/>
Take the tale of a certain 31-year-old hatamoto (vassal to the <br/>
shogun) named Hitoyanagi Naosato, who, a high official named Mizuno <br/>
Tamenaga recorded, was stripped of his samurai status for having <br/>
procured the services of a prostitute in the Yoshiwara brothel <br/>
quarter. The story, which broke in the eleventh lunar month of 1780, <br/>
was a bit more complicated than that: It seems Naosato's previous <br/>
wife had given him a son, named Ushinosuke, who was 10 years old. <br/>
The new wife, whose name and age went unrecorded in this account, <br/>
felt little affection for her stepson and abused him severely <br/>
(another crime). What's more, when Naosato was absent from Edo on <br/>
assignment to the provinces, his wife would invite her cronies into <br/>
his compound, turning their residence into an illegal gambling den <br/>
(yet another crime). She also engaged in trysts with other samurai, <br/>
leading the official recorder Mizuno to accord her the sobriquet <br/>
of "inpu" (slut).<br/>
<br/>
The wife, it was alleged, had formerly worked as a freelance <br/>
prostitute (as opposed to those who labored under indentured <br/>
servitude), and through connivance had somehow managed to get <br/>
herself adopted into a samurai family. Armed with this new identity, <br/>
she then wed Naosato, and as a noble lady free from suspicion was <br/>
able to launder prostitutes' earnings. These funds were used to <br/>
build up her husband's status to hatamoto.<br/>
<br/>
But it was the parental abuse meted out to Ushinosuke that led to <br/>
her downfall. A servant named Rokubei took pity on the boy and <br/>
spilled all to Naosato. When news of the wife's misdeeds reached <br/>
Tokugawa Sadanobu --- the Shogun's cousin and chief advisor --- she <br/>
was brought before the Edo magistrate and publicly reprimanded. <br/>
Rather than beg for mercy, however, she turned to toward the judge, <br/>
batted her eyelashes furiously and said, in a voice dripping with <br/>
feminine guile, "Oh your honor, it must be the first time you've <br/>
ever encountered a woman like me. . ."<br/>
<br/>
Infuriated by this brazen, unrepentant attitude, the judge sentenced <br/>
her to exile on one of the Izu Islands.<br/>
<br/>
In the fourth lunar month of 1842, Inaba Masamori, the lord of Yodo, <br/>
in Yamashiro province (present-day southeastern Kyoto) a lord named <br/>
was stripped of his title as High Commissioner of Temples and <br/>
Shrines. Three months later, he was divested of his domain.<br/>
<br/>
Six years earlier, his wife's infidelity had come to light when she <br/>
was found murdered in an Osaka storehouse. The investigation led to <br/>
a host of other sexual and financial indiscretions and a nationwide <br/>
scandal ensued, in which Masamori became known among Japan's nobles <br/>
as "Baka-dono" (Lord Fool).<br/>
<br/>
One of the most notorious scandals of the pre-modern era involved <br/>
Tokugawa Nariaki, lord of the powerful Mito domain, and a lovely <br/>
lassie from Kyoto named Karahashi.<br/>
<br/>
Nariaki was a compulsive womanizer and it wasn't long before <br/>
Karahashi found herself with child. Although he was obliged to make <br/>
periodic stays in Edo, he began finding all sorts of pretexts to <br/>
remain in Mito, giving the Shogunal authorities such excuses as <br/>
needing to build up the coastal defenses, conduct military maneuvers <br/>
or make long-overdue reforms of the province's administrative <br/>
offices.<br/>
<br/>
The problem was that Nariaki's official wife, the daughter of a <br/>
powerful lord, realized that his philandering was endangering the <br/>
family's position and began to take matters into her own hands.<br/>
<br/>
Sensing the walls closing in, around 1843 Karahashi pleaded illness <br/>
and fled to Kyoto. In addition to being stripped of his title, <br/>
Nariaki was punished by being forced to make the rounds of temples <br/>
in his province and melt down their bells to produce cannonballs.<br/>
<br/>
Perhaps part of the problem was that Japanese of the ruling samurai <br/>
class were just getting to know women again; up to 1700 or so, <br/>
romance commonly took the form of "shudo" (pederasty --- written <br/>
with characters meaning "the way of the masses"). This was no doubt <br/>
a legacy of the period of 16th century civil war, when samurai were <br/>
in constant battle and had little time for family life. While in <br/>
their military encampments older men and adolescent youth would pair <br/>
off for romantic trysts.<br/>
<br/>
But after the Tokugawa dynasty consolidated its power, the samurai <br/>
became more domesticated and from the late 1600s, authorities in <br/>
some provinces began banning the practice of shudo (also referred to <br/>
as "nanshoku") due to duels being fought between rivals.<br/>
<br/>
Whatever the reason, historical sources noted a pronounced shift in <br/>
samurai interests away from partners of the same sex toward women <br/>
from around 1700 AD.<br/>
<br/>
As evidence of this, he cites a story of a love triangle that <br/>
appeared in the 16th year of Genroku (1703), in which a gay blade <br/>
cheated on his young male lover by cavorting with a prostitute. He <br/>
found the experience of passion with a woman so pleasurable he <br/>
promptly jilted his colleague, setting up house with the daughter of <br/>
a respectable family, who subsequently gave birth to a child. The <br/>
young bushi (warrior) became the odd man out and, to add insult to <br/>
injury lost his retainer status. Out on the street, he found himself <br/>
a ronin (masterless samurai) left to fend for himself. (By Masuo <br/>
Kamiyama, People's Pick writer)<br/>
