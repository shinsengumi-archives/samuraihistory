<div id="ygrps-yiv-295669609">Hi to everyone who reads this,<br/>
<br/>
I am new to Samurai culture. I have been interested in it for a long <br/>
time, especially in the code of the Samurai, the Bushido, as it <br/>
seems to me to be an excellent way to live ones life. I am now <br/>
trying to learn about the history of the Samurai order, however i <br/>
know very little. Is it possible someone could recomend some <br/>
starting literature or websites that would be beneficial to me? My e-<br/>
mail address is <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="mailto:wolfscryanddragonsbreath@...">wolfscryanddragonsbreath@...</a> If you do have <br/>
any help, it would be greatly appreciated.<br/>
<br/>
Thanking you all in advance! :-)<br/>
