<h3>Japan and the Emancipator</h3>

Harvard history professor Daniel Botsman discusses the progress and <br/>
plight of Japan's Burakumin under Meiji rule.<br/>
<br/>
A story involving beautiful flowers, Mito Mitsukuni, and then, to <br/>
top it all off, the greatest military hero of the imperial past, <br/>
Kusunoki Masashige, seems just a little bit too good to be true.<br/>

They took away the corpses of people who fell ill and died in the <br/>
streets. They posted the severed heads of criminals in public and <br/>
guarded them. They were responsible for the carcasses of cows. Some <br/>
made leather and some sold flowers. These were the Burakumin, the <br/>
outcasts of Japan. <br/>
<br/>
Descendants of Burakumin, Japanese people distinguished by caste, <br/>
not ethnicity, continue to face unofficial discrimination in Japan.<br/>
<br/>
Daniel Botsman, a professor of history at Harvard University, told <br/>
the ironic story of the "emancipatory moment" of the outcasts in <br/>
Meiji Japan (1868-1912) at a colloquium sponsored by the UCLA Center <br/>
for Japanese Studies on Oct. 31. The Burakumin were granted commoner <br/>
status in the Emancipation Edict of 1871, the culmination of a <br/>
campaign spearheaded by Ôe Taku, a prominent citizen. It was Ôe who <br/>
formally proposed that the outcast status of the Burakumin be <br/>
abolished. <br/>
<br/>
However, this story of liberation has no fairy-tale ending, and the <br/>
emancipator's motives were perhaps not as altruistic as he made out, <br/>
according to Botsman.<br/>
<br/>
Ôe, born to a lower-class samurai family, devoted himself to the <br/>
cause of the emperor and the restoration movement of the 1860s. He <br/>
was active in politics and business, including a stint as a railway <br/>
magnate in colonial Korea. He eventually was appointed as a judge in <br/>
the Kobe area court, a "treaty port" where foreigners were beginning <br/>
to set up consulates and trade. <br/>
<br/>
In a 1919 speech, Ôe said that his interest in the outcasts' cause <br/>
had been sparked during a stroll when he stumbled on Furonodani, a <br/>
village under the general authority of the Kobe area. Ôe said he had <br/>
been touched by the poverty of the people and noticed they were <br/>
mostly flower sellers, a "beautiful door-to-door trade" that they <br/>
alone were allowed to pursue. He found out, he said, that their <br/>
monopoly on the trade stemmed from loyalty to the great fourteenth-<br/>
century imperial general Kusunoki Masashige. <br/>
<br/>
According to legend, in the early Tokugawa period (seventeenth <br/>
century), a great daimyo lord, Mitsukuni of Mito, happened across <br/>
the grave of Kusunoki, who had died trying to reassert the power of <br/>
the Imperial throne. The general's grave was nondescript and sat in <br/>
a lonely paddy field. Yet each morning without fail, Mitsukuni <br/>
noticed, fresh incense burned and fresh flowers had been laid there. <br/>
He wondered who could be responsible. Soon he found that the people <br/>
of Furonodani were the ones loyally tending to this grave centuries <br/>
after the great general's death. In recognition of their loyal <br/>
service, Mitsukuni granted them the exclusive privilege of selling <br/>
flowers in the region.<br/>
<br/>
'Leather Was King'<br/>
Although his later account made it seem that the villagers who <br/>
touched Ôe were all flower-sellers, they were in fact mostly makers <br/>
of leather. Botsman showed this with evidence from population <br/>
registers. The Burakumin had the dirty job of skinning and tanning <br/>
the carcasses of cows that they were responsible for collecting.<br/>
<br/>
Was Ôe simply mistaken? Although there were many Burakumin flower-<br/>
sellers, about six times as many of them were leather workers. It <br/>
seems that Ôe focused on one aspect of their livelihood in order to <br/>
win them sympathy, Botsman said. A story involving "beautiful <br/>
flowers, Mito Mitsukuni, and then, to top it all off, the greatest <br/>
military hero of the imperial past, Kusunoki Masashige, seems just a <br/>
little bit too good to be true." <br/>
<br/>
Botsman also pointed out that Ôe grew up near a village of these <br/>
eta, or outcasts, and had hired them to clear some of his land. <br/>
Clearly, he had been exposed to these people before. Where he worked <br/>
in the Kobe region, the Burakumin were practically on his office's <br/>
doorstep, according to Botsman.<br/>
<br/>
Furonodani was located very close to the burgeoning port area of <br/>
Kobe, where westerners were officially allowed to set up shop. While <br/>
demand for beef was growing, leather had always been used to make <br/>
sandals that were popular in Japan. Even more important in the Meiji <br/>
era were leather boots, straps, and belts for the westernizing <br/>
army. "Leather was king," Botsman said.<br/>
<br/>
Slaughtering cows and manufacturing leather was a dirty job that <br/>
only the outcasts could do, but there were not enough of them. The <br/>
industry needed more hands, as Ôe was well aware. He worked in the <br/>
local courthouse and had significant responsibility over the <br/>
new "treaty port."<br/>
<br/>
Botsman concluded that Ôe invented much of his flowery appeal for <br/>
reform in order to bolster the industry. By raising people who had <br/>
their hands in the leather and slaughtering business to the status <br/>
of others, he hoped to remove its stigma. As long as people shunned <br/>
the industry, labor and investment would be difficult to attract.<br/>
<br/>
In his 1919 speech Ôe vouched for the Burakumin to a council charged <br/>
with doing something about the "Burakumin problem." Though formally <br/>
emancipated 50 years prior, the Burakumin were still a disadvantaged <br/>
social group, potentially ripe for revolution against their imperial <br/>
government. Japanese officials may have worried about this after <br/>
witnessing a socialist revolution in Russia. Botsman said Ôe <br/>
intended to help them again in order to prevent such an uprising.<br/>
<br/>
According to Botsman, then, development of the leather industry and <br/>
subversion of revolution were, in turn, motives behind Ôe's <br/>
championing of the Burakumin's cause.<br/>
<br/>
