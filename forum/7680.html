The Shinsengumi was the most dreaded police force in Japanese <br/>
history. It was formed by the shogun?s government, the Tokugawa <br/>
Shogunate, to combat revolutionaries who wreaked terror on the <br/>
streets of the Imperial Capital. The corps existed for 5 years (1863-<br/>
1868). It disintegrated with the collapse of the shogunate.<br/>
<br/>
The Shinsengumi is widely depicted in Japan. SHINSENGUMI: The Shogun?<br/>
s Last Samurai Corps (Tuttle Publishing) is the first book about the <br/>
corps in English. While focusing on the Shinsengumi, Hillsborough <br/>
has written a history-in-brief of the Meiji Restoration, Japan?s <br/>
greatest revolution. The revolution centered around the overthrow of <br/>
the shogunate in 1868 and the restoration of power to the emperor. <br/>
Just as the Meiji Restoration is considered ?the dawn of modern <br/>
Japan,? knowledge of this history is essential to understanding how <br/>
and why Japan has evolved into the nation that it is today. <br/>
<br/>
In this nonfiction historical narrative of the Shinsengumi, <br/>
Hillsborough spotlights the personalities of the corps? leaders. ?<br/>
This book is about bloodshed and death and atrocity,? begins the <br/>
Preface. ?It is also about courage and honor and fidelity. It <br/>
explores some of the darkest regions of the human soul, and some of <br/>
its most noble parts. The underlying themes?are the extraordinary <br/>
will to power and sense of self-importance of the leaders of this <br/>
most lethal samurai corps, and the unsurpassed propensity to kill <br/>
instilled by them into the rank and file.? The narrative is <br/>
embellished by numerous vivid anecdotal episodes, including sword <br/>
fights, assassinations and personal stories to illustrate the nature <br/>
and spirit of the Shinsengumi. Also included are numerous quotes <br/>
from letters, memoirs and interviews by corpsmen, eyewitnesses of <br/>
events and other people directly involved with the Shinsengumi and <br/>
their history.<br/>
<br/>
Ridgeback Press, publisher of Hillsborough?s Samurai History Papers, <br/>
an electronic quarterly, is making signed copies of SHINSENGUMI <br/>
available to subscribers of the Papers. For more information on this <br/>

focusing on this history, including broadcasts of the History <br/>
Channel, and NHK (Japan?s national public broadcaster). Hillsborough <br/>
lived in Japan for sixteen years. Fluent in Japanese, he has worked <br/>
as a staff writer for a Japanese magazine in Tokyo, and as a US <br/>
