<h3>Tatsuya Fujishiro comes to England</h3>
by <i>jin_gai_guy</i>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-195703150">Dear All,<br/>
<br/>
I am pleased to confirm that the current first prize winner of last years <br/>
polishing competitition Tatsuya Fujishiro, the grandson of Matsuo Fujishiro <br/>
and son of Okisato Fujishiro, will be coming to give a demonstration in <br/>
England on May 6/7 at the Birmingham National Exhibition Center. The event <br/>
is a martila arts event called seni06 (www.senishow.com) Europe's largest <br/>
martial arts trade fair. Tatsuya Fujishiro will also give a lecture on sword <br/>
polishing.<br/>
<br/>
This will be followed on Monday the 10th with a special meeting of the <br/>
To-ken Society of Great Britain, where he will also give a talk.<br/>
<br/>
This has been made possible by the joint efforts of Cyberbudo Magazine, <br/>
European fighting arts international and the To-ken Society of Great <br/>
Britain. Tatsuya will be at the Cyberbudo stand. Please come and say hello. <br/>
There will also be good quality uchiko, oil and books for sale.<br/>
