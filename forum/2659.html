<h3>Nagashino (again)</h3>
by <i>cepooooo</i>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1769301429">Ok, I finally managed to talk with Dr.Varley about Nagashino.<br/>
It's true, it was NOT the first battle where guns were used <br/>
systematically, but what was peculiar about Nagashino was the number of <br/>
guns used. in fact, the story says that Nobunaga had 3,000 shooters, <br/>
who were divided in 3 groups of 1,000. Now, the problem is that, even <br/>
today, it would be impossible to have 1,000 people to shoot exactly in <br/>
synchro fashion, especially with a 16th c. weapon. So, the number of <br/>
shooters might have been inflated by Nobunaga's side, just to impress <br/>
the other daimyo.<br/>
Dr.Varley told me that there is a new article by one of his colleagues <br/>
(sorry, forgot to ask who) that examines the battle from a <br/>
historical/martial point of view. It is not published, but he'll let me <br/>
have a copy--so, I'll be back to you once I have read it.<br/>

I'll bug Dr.Varley when I see him Thursday, but I doubt I will put my <br/>
hands on that article before January. Anyway, once I have it, be sure <br/>
I'll be happy to share it.<br/>
