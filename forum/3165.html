<h3>Excessive quoting brings bad karma</h3>
by <i>goldrushg</i>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-583350241">I would like to politely ask that anyone quoting a message in their <br/>
reply please check to make sure that only a brief (and presumably relevant) <br/>
portion of text is actually quoted in your reply. I've noticed some folks <br/>
are quoting entire messages (some of which have included the entirety of <br/>
messages that *they* were replies to). The result is a digest that contains <br/>
pages and pages of needless text.<br/>
<br/>
   I find some of the messages here quite interesting and I enjoy reading <br/>
them...once. But after the fifth, tenth or twentieth time the newness and <br/>
interest wanes a bit. ;)<br/>
<br/>
   Thanks for your consideration.<br/>
<br/>
