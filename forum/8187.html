Jidai geki -- period dramas set in and around the days of the samurai<br/>
-- used to be The History Channel of film genres -- something beloved<br/>
by the Viagra set. Not now, though; at least not entirely.<br/>
MTV-generation directors such as Hiroyuki Nakano ("Red Shadow") and<br/>
Ryuhei Kitamura ("Aragami") have decided that the essence of the genre<br/>
is action -- with all those swords coming out.<br/>
<br/>
Their jidai geki are arcade fight games on film, set to thumping,<br/>
pulsing electronic scores. Forget the long, slow build-up to a<br/>
one-against-all climax. These guys start with a bang -- or, rather,<br/>
blood spurts -- and never let up.<br/>
<br/>
Hideaki Sunaga's "Nagurimono: Love and Kill" is in this line: The<br/>
first scene is of two man-mountains slamming the bejesus out of each<br/>
other. His film, however, was produced by Dream Stage Entertainment<br/>
(DSE), which also manages Pride Fighting Championships -- mixed<br/>
martial arts bouts fought by champions in their respective<br/>
disciplines: judo, wrestling, karate and so on. This, folks, is the<br/>
real deal and the heart of the film is bouts between real Pride<br/>
fighters -- Kazushi Sakuraba, Yoshihiro Takayama, Wanderlei Silva,<br/>
Quinton Jackson and Don Fry -- that make most martial-arts movie<br/>
action look as choreographed as ballet.<br/>
<br/>
This is also not the sort of thing usually found in a real jidai geki<br/>
-- a problem the film only papers over.<br/>
<br/>
The story: A foppish English businessman (Christian Storms) stages a<br/>
martial-arts contest between champions of two rival yakuza gangs to<br/>
resolve a dispute over a wonder drug he is dealing and that both sides<br/>
want.<br/>
<br/>
The leader of one gang, the short-fused, pistol-packing Aijiro<br/>
(Takanori Jinnai) is mad for a new anything-goes fighting style in<br/>
which two opponents punch, kick, wrestle and choke each other until<br/>
one is unconscious -- or dead. His loyal, dandyish lieutenant Anrai<br/>
(Hiroshi Tamaki) scouts new fighters, but never steps in the ring<br/>
himself. On the day of the big event, Anrai spots the businessman<br/>
dallying with a beautiful prostitute (Asami Mizukawa) with whom he was<br/>
raised, and has long loved. There is more at stake here, we start to<br/>
see, than who whups who.<br/>
<br/>
The plot complications exist in a parallel universe from the fighting<br/>
action -- making "Nagurimono" a strange, if intermittently watchable,<br/>
hybrid. Producer Nobuyuki Sakakibara, who also heads DSE, should have<br/>
put the one Pride fighter with rudimentary acting skills -- the<br/>
likable but scarily powerful Kazushi Sakuraba -- at the center of the<br/>
film. Then he might have had a "Rocky," not a curiosity.<br/>
<br/>
More in the traditional jidai geki line is Mitsuo Kurotsuchi's "Semi<br/>
Shigure," a film based on a novel by Shuhei Fujisawa that has already<br/>
been made into an NHK drama with a prizewinning script by Kurotsuchi.<br/>
Set in Tohoku in the late Edo Period, the film has as its hero, not<br/>
the usual historical figure or super swordsman, but a young samurai,<br/>
Bunshiro Maki (Takuya Ishida), near the bottom of the status ladder.<br/>
He falls even farther down when his kindly father (Ken Ogata) is<br/>
accused of plotting against the clan lord and is forced to commit<br/>
seppuku (ritual suicide).<br/>
<br/>
More than Bunshiro's struggle to regain family honor, however, the<br/>
story focuses on his relationship with Fuku (Aimi Satsukawa), a<br/>
servant girl he falls for as a 15-year-old, but says nary a word to.<br/>
The bashful Fuku can hardly bring herself to speak to him as well,<br/>
though she loves him madly. Then she is sent away to Edo to serve in<br/>
the lord's household. Meanwhile, Bunshiro and his patiently enduring<br/>
mother (Chieko Baisho) struggle on in poverty and disgrace. Bunshiro's<br/>
one salvation is his swordsmanship, which he practices to the point of<br/>
exhaustion, as though to sweat out his pain.<br/>
<br/>
Skip ahead a few years. Fuku (Yoshino Kimura) is now the lord's<br/>
concubine -- and the mother of his child. She has also become the<br/>
focus of a clan succession struggle, with one side wanting her and her<br/>
son violently removed from the power equation. Hearing of her danger,<br/>
Bunshiro (Somegoro Ichikawa) and two childhood pals plan to rescue<br/>
her. The swords finally come out.<br/>
<br/>
This pattern -- an ordinary samurai placed under extraordinary<br/>
pressure, with the stress more on basic human emotions than<br/>
slice-and-dice action -- is also that of Yoji Yamada's "Tasogare<br/>
Seibei (The Twilight Samurai)" and "Kakushiken Oni no Tsume (The<br/>
Hidden Blade)," both likewise based on fiction by Fujisawa.<br/>
<br/>
Kurotsuchi, a veteran TV scriptwriter and director, uses Yamada's work<br/>
as a model and succeeds, much as Yamada did, in humanizing his people<br/>
and moving his audience. In key emotional scenes, as when Fuku and<br/>
Bunshiro push a cart carrying the body of Bunshiro's father up a<br/>
mountain path, the simplicity of word and image and the "timeless"<br/>
pace open up the tear ducts, uncontrollably. (Not that I tried to hold<br/>
it in.)<br/>
<br/>
Kurotsuchi risks undercutting his story's power by using two sets of<br/>
actors for the roles of Bunshiro and Fuku. Somegoro Ichikawa -- a<br/>
kabuki star who has branched out successfully into contemporary dramas<br/>
and films -- makes a smooth transition from the actor playing his<br/>
younger self, while Yoshino Kimura is prim, pretty and completely<br/>
different from the shy, pudgy-faced girl of the opening scenes. It is<br/>
only in the film's charged climax that she bridges the gap, and the<br/>
tears start flowing again.<br/>
<br/>
Many recent Japanese films about star-crossed love only dress up<br/>
ancient genre conventions in new fashions, from MTV and elsewhere. The<br/>
more conventionally shot "Semi Shigure" strips away the cliches to the<br/>
plain, unbearable truth: Some goodbyes are forever, even at 15.<br/>
Especially at 15.<br/>
