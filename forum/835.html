In regard to Japanese history, Kamakura (in Kanagawa<br/>
Prefecture, about 50 minutes by train south of Tokyo<br/>
is well worth a visit, as there are a number of<br/>
swordmakers in the vicinity, aswell as the historical<br/>
sights themselves .  If you're in Osaka, a visit to<br/>
the Osaka-jo is well worth a visit .  The castle<br/>
itself is a twentieth reconstruction but the<br/>
exhibitions regarding the city's medieval history, and<br/>
in particular the camapaigns of 1615, are excellent .<br/>
Kyoto is another obvious choice as history lurks<br/>
around most corners, and a trip to Fukuoka could<br/>
include visits to sights related to the Mongols'<br/>
attempted invasions of the latter thirteenth century .<br/>
I hope you have as good a time in Japan as I do .<br/>

<h3>Re: places to visit in Japan</h3>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-277893418">For me the two best places to visit is Mt. Hiei, site of the Enryaku-<br/>
ji monastery, and the Bishamon temple in Yamashina, Kyoto (a 20 or so <br/>
minute walk from Yamashina station).  <br/>
Mt. Hiei is well worth it just to see not only how huge the whole <br/>
complex is, but to marvel at how in the world Nobunaga could have <br/>
ever gathered enough forces to surround and burn such a huge place.<br/>
As for Bishamon, for me it has a more authentic look and feel than <br/>
almost any other temples I've been to (and I've been to MANY) - it <br/>
served as rest stops for many Daimyo, including Hideyoshi and <br/>
Tokugawa.  It is still quite isolated, and doesn't get much tourist <br/>
traffic, which makes it even better, and my grandmother-in-law lives <br/>
down a path a few minutes walk away from it, so I've been there quite <br/>
a few times. It is one of the temples I never get tired of walking <br/>
around it.  The 5 or 600 yen entry fee is actually reasonable when <br/>
compared to the average. <br/>
Osaka castle is also well worth the trip for the museum inside - just <br/>
pretend that it isn't a cement reconstruction, and you'll be fine.<br/>
Daigo-ji in kyoto is also worth a trip to see the site of Hideyoshi's <br/>
final cherry blossom viewing ceremony, although according to one of <br/>
the monks, it what is there now was completed after hideyoshi's <br/>
death.  It was in the process of being redone while he was alive. <br/>
If you were going to Kyushu, I'd recommend going to Omura castle in <br/>
Nagasaki, and to the remains of the castle in Saiki, Oita (I think is <br/>
tsuru-yama), and the associated temple there.  The temple was <br/>
originally on the mountain where the castle remains now stand, but in <br/>
around 1604 or so the lord had the temple taken off the mountain and <br/>
relocated, because he wanted his castle up there.  Soon after it was <br/>
finished, it was struck by lightning and burned to the ground.  They <br/>
took it as a bad omen for moving the shrine, and never rebuilt the <br/>
castle.  It is in a good location, you can see over the entire city.  <br/>
There is even the remains of a WWII AA gun emplacement on the castle <br/>
grounds.</div>
