That particular site seems blackly humorous, but here's a real life story about a situation just this past this week here in the <br/>
States:<br/>

Spent thousands of dollars and at least 3 weeks of<br/>
time on "ninja" training? Don't know what to do with<br/>
that straight sword of yours? Join Black Market<br/>

(If you can't tell this is a satirical website, you<br/>
probably need to be sterilized. But then, you'd just<br/>
be trying to get babies through the website, wouldn't<br/>
you? So I'll spell it out: IT'S A JOKE!)<br/>

I'm aware of the story, and thanks for reminding us of<br/>
the more sobering aspects of human stupidity. However,<br/>
I'll point out the website IS satirical, and nowhere<br/>
is anything like the events that took place in this<br/>
horrible affair mentioned or condoned. <br/>
<br/>
My thoughts and prayers go out to the spirit of that<br/>
young woman, her husband who's now left alone to take<br/>
care of the child, and that poor child who will never<br/>
meet it's mother. <br/>
<br/>
While it's important to take things toungue in cheek,<br/>
we should remember that some things are serious. And<br/>
while we should take some things seriously, it's<br/>
important to remember there are other things that are<br/>
intended as jokes, and should be taken so. <br/>
<br/>
Nate<br/>

Oh very yes, and very black humor, indeed.  I enjoyed it very much.<br/>
<br/>
I just happened to be reading the story on the young Missouri mom when your <br/>
original post came through and wasn't sure if it had reached the <br/>
international level. I also recalled the little incident over the 'Ninja <br/>
Day' thing.  Such disconnects with reality and inability to discern fact <br/>
from fiction & satire is very scary to me.<br/>
<br/>
But don't get me written off as a sour old she-goat who wants nothing more <br/>
than to head-butt everything in sight. I'm very ready to laugh at the <br/>
foibles of humans (including myself), be silly, play with my kids, sing <br/>
off-key, and render a very sharp opinion once in a while..... among other <br/>
things....<br/>
<br/>
.... don't forget, wicked, too....<br/>
