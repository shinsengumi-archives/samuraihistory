Hanzo's spear is at Sainen-ji temple near the Emperor's Palace (the former Edo Castle) in Tokyo. Hanzo endowed the temple and his gravesite is there. The spear was heavily damaged during the American firebombings of Tokyo in WWII and I believe only the blade with a small bit of shaft remains.</div>

<br/>
This seemed like an interesting topic for research by a recently retired man!!  One saying came to mind immediately - "Ask not what you can do for your computer, but what your computer can do for you" (with apologies to President John F. Kennedy).  By this I mean, before seeking advice one should comb cyber space for the information one seeks.<br/>
<br/>
Having done this for the last half hour I find that google searches for "Hanzo Hattori" (with quotes) leads to something like 22,300 hits, many in foreign languages.  Then, very common hits occur on sites related to this list's bête noire - Ninja...<br/>
<br/>
Then I found a ninja expression - "patience is but a short time".  I found this particularly apposite to web searches of the sort before me!!!  So, to the findings:<br/>

<br/>
I found the following:<br/>
To this day, artifacts of Hanzo's legacy remain; the Imperial Palace (formerly the shogun's palace) still has a gate called Hanzo's Gate, and the Hanzo-mon subway line which runs from central Tokyo to the southwestern suburbs is named after the gate. Hanzo's remains now rest in the Sainen-ji temple cemetery in Shinjuku, Tokyo. The temple also holds his favorite spears.<br/>
<br/>
This leads to still more searches, which I will now leave to those more interested in the topic, like searching on "Sainen-ji"...<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote> From Nihon no Meiso by Numata;<br/>
<br/>
	Once a splendid Omi-yari with a ryo-shinogi blade 3shaku 3zun 3bu in  <br/>
length, copper fittings, with an oak pole 5shaku 7sun long. In it's  <br/>
current state the broken blade is just 3shaku 2sun 2bu(99.4cm) and  <br/>
half of the original pole is burnt away. There are three mekugi-ana  <br/>
in the heavily rusted nakago and no signature is visible. Temple  <br/>
records suggest that it was damaged in an earthquake sometime in the  <br/>
Ansei period.<br/>
	It is said he was the head of the Iga ninja clan and a splendid  <br/>
warrior. There was a popular saying;<br/>
	Tokugawa-dono wa hito mochi yo<br/>
	Hattori Hanzo Oni Hanzo<br/>
	Watanabe Hanzo Yari Hanzo<br/>
	Atsumi Gengo wa Kubitori Gengo<br/>
<br/>
	Lord Tokugawa is a man rich with able men<br/>
	Hattori Hanzo "The Demon Hanzo"<br/>
	Watanabe Hanzo "Hanzo the spear"<br/>
	Atsumi Gengo "The Headhunter Gengo"<br/>
<br/>
	The Kansei Kafu records that Hattori Hanzo was crucial in the attack  <br/>
of Kakegawa-jo. His contribution was noted in the battles of Anegawa,  <br/>
Ushikubo, Kozakai and Takatenjin and he earned special merit at  <br/>
Mikatagahara.<br/>
	At Hamamatsu-jo he was presented with a Yari, and given command of  <br/>
150 Iga no mono. It is not clear if this THE spear he was presented  <br/>
with. Afterward he defeated Chikuwan, a Takeda spy and took as prize  <br/>
his Soshu Hiromasa Kaiken (tanto), a deed for which he was given an  <br/>
Oboshi kabuto, a yoroi and a saihai.<br/>
	At the time of the attack on the Honno-ji, Iyeyasu needed to return  <br/>
quickly to Mikawa. It was Hattori and his Iga men that provided the  <br/>
body guard on that trip. Iyeyasu rewarded him with Ishimi no mura,  <br/>
with an estimated annual rice production of 8000 koku. He took up  <br/>
residence within Edo castle where to this day the Hanzo gate honors  <br/>
his name. Hanzo died in Keicho gannen aged 55. The original Sainen-ji  <br/>
was located just outside the Hanzo-mon until it was moved to it's  <br/>
present location for the expansion of Edo Castle.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
	There is a picture of this yari in the catalog of the Nihon no Meiso  <br/>
exhibition. If I get the chance I will try to scan it in and post it  <br/>
in the photo albums, though I have to say it isn't much to look at...<br/>

I think I have seen a monograph on the Hogen disturbance, but if I  <br/>
remember well it was some dissertation  or a limited print; since the  <br/>
pages inside were "typed" the way thesis/dissertations used to be  <br/>
until a couple of decades ago. Have you seen it? I might actually  <br/>
have a copy, alas, it is at my place in Japan and I have no idea  <br/>
about when I will return.<br/>
<br/>
Will you share your thesis with us once is done? :o)<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1062215394">It is my understanding that the original was lost in a fire and what we have as the main text dates from the 1800's and is written in its original Portugese language. Im not sure if that was broken into three seperate volumes or not. I know the Japanese translation is something like 12 volumes. <br/>
<br/>
I have the book information from Amazon UK, but that's about as far as I got... If you translate this, you may want to publish it as it would be a very time-consuming process. However, if you want to undertake something like that, Im sure the English-speaking community would be quite impressed :)<br/>
