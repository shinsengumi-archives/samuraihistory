There is no substitute for real knowledge - go here to begin your quest:<br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://home.earthlink.net/~steinrl/nihonto.htm">http://home.earthlink.net/~steinrl/nihonto.htm</a><br/>
And above all, buy books if you have a serious rather than a casual approach to katana...<br/>
<br/>
To answer your questions:<br/>
- Simply, katana are made of "steel" steel.  Pure iron with 0.8% carbon added is tool steel, comparable to the edge steel of a katana.  The hardness of iron/steel is manipulated by varying the carbon content and heat treating appropriately.  Modern steels are alloys with elements other than carbon also added.<br/>
- Katana have never weighed 50 lbs!!!  I have just gone and got out a ca 1700 katana.  It weighed 1 1/2 lbs (700 grams).  It is about an average size.  In a temple in Japan there is a katana 6 foot or more long.  It might weight 5 lbs, but it is a votive offering to the Gods and not a serious combat sword.<br/>
- Miyamoto Musashi's sword??  No idea...<br/>

I had heard that one of the swords owned by Musashi was a shodai Hizen Tadayoshi which would have been a new sword to Musashi as they both lived about the same time. Also about the long sword to which you refer, you may be confusing this with that used by Sasaki Ganryu in their famous duel. Sasaki was reputed to have a very long sword called the "Swallow Cutter" I believe.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-509011">I seem to remember reading that since meteoric iron was used in the some <br/>
of the higher quality blades, you would also have a steel with nickel <br/>
and other elements as well as carbon. Steel until the early 20th century <br/>
was still a bit of a black art and even now there are claims for new <br/>
alloys that are pretty outrageous if true.<br/>
