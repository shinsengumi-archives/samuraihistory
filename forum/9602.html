<h3>3rd fundraiser auction for journal: Battle Royale and Azumi manga</h3>
by <i>kitsuno</i>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1589475922">Here is the third ebay fundraiser auction:<br/>
<br/>
Battle Royale / Azumi - 3 issues.<br/>
<br/>
These are three imported Japanese Manga that are based on the Japanese<br/>
movies "Battle Royale", and "Azumi". There are two issues of "Azumi" -<br/>
Issue #5 and #7.<br/>
<br/>
Battle Royale is the first issue of the series that follows a<br/>
highschool graduating class forced to fight to the death, and is in<br/>
excellent condition, with a full color dust jacket in great condition<br/>
and is 209 pages. This issue was published in 2001.<br/>
<br/>
The issues of Azumi are #5 and #7, and are in good condition, with<br/>
some shelf wear on the dust jackets. Both issues have full color dust<br/>
jackets, and were published in 2003, and have approximately 206 pages<br/>
each. Azumi follows the story of a female assassin during the Sengoku<br/>
period of Japanese history.<br/>
<br/>
All three are Japanese imports and are the original Japanese language<br/>
editions.<br/>
