Some says it's Oda Nobuo being rash and wanting to make a name for himself. Some say that there were rebels from Ise who ran and hid in Iga and Nobuo only wanted to take care of those rebels.</p><p style="color:rgb(0, 0, 0);font-size:13px;background-color:transparent;font-style:normal;"><br></p><p style="color:rgb(0, 0, 0);font-size:13px;background-color:transparent;font-style:normal;">I read Shinchou-ko ki and this was something that was barely mentioned at all, so that's no help either.
