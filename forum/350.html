<div id="ygrps-yiv-1369115959">Hello,<br/>
 I believe that the answer to the Hakama problem really lies in what type of <br/>
Hakama you are talking about..Hakama were generally worn by by everyone. In <br/>
much the same way as 'most' men wear trousers nowadays they were simply <br/>
adapted to the users purpose. (Hence the 'tucked up' varieties for farmers <br/>
and people who had to 'wade' in things[Blood for instance..sick but still] <br/>
etc..<br/>
 I don't believe that Hakama were formalised at all. But then again my <br/>
knowledge of Pro-Tokugawa (1600 onwards) is not as detailed as before these <br/>
dates.<br/>
 Check a search in E-Budo for the same question for a (MUCH!!) wider response.<br/>
 Hope this helps you.<br/>

The readers' digest answer is, "no, he didn't *have* to, but you don't<br/>
*have* to wear pants, either." Basically throughout Japanese history anyone<br/>
with any class -- even peasants -- wore pants. It wasn't until the Edo<br/>
period that you see people walking around in public in their underwear<br/>
(kosode/kimono). People of breeding or just desirous of not coming across as<br/>
a total scum wore something OVER their kimono until the 1600s, whether a<br/>
kataginu (a sideless vest) or a dobuku (the forerunner of the haori).<br/>

<br/>
Hakama were never formalized into a must wear<br/>
necessity.  There were different forms of hakama that<br/>
were worn  at different times.  There was even a long<br/>
version worn in the shoguns palace during the edo<br/>
period that were very hard to move around in.  During<br/>
the summer some samurai would wear kimono or a shorter<br/>
version of the hakama.  These were common to foot<br/>
soldiers in the summer.  For very formal occassions<br/>
during the late sengoku jidai and the tokugawa/edo<br/>
period they would wear something called kamishimo<br/>
which was essentially a hakama and a stiff shouldered<br/>
top that covered there kimono or whatever particular<br/>
shirt they were wearing.  These could be formalized<br/>
for a particular daimyo and or family.<br/>
<br/>
Hope this is helpful<br/>

 </span></blockquote>  The Hakama was a prefered garment.  The Kimono bound the legs and made shiko (knee walking for indoors) very difficult. The Hakama was also heavily desinged for horsemanship (jobajitsu)which the Kimono was not. In Martial arts training halls it was the norm. as recently as the 1950's, students of Aikido founder Morihei Ueshiba were sent home from training if they did not have Hakama, only zubon (pants) with them.</div>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-499614788">Thanks,<br/>
<br/>
You have to remember that history is a very hard<br/>
subject to give solid info on because of the usually<br/>
second hand information that is used.  Don't let your<br/>
experience with this ruin your interest in this<br/>
mailing group as their are many people who know there<br/>
stuff.  Anthony J. Bryant is only one of these.  <br/>
<br/>
Thank you very much for the return email.  I hope that<br/>
in the future if I have a question you might be there<br/>
to help me.<br/>
