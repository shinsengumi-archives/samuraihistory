The second motion picture in Framingham State College's <br/>
International Film Series, Dr. Arthur Noletti presents the Japanese <br/>
film The Twilight Samurai on Thursday, Oct. 7, followed by a <br/>
discussion. <br/>
 <br/>
     Set in the late 19th century, Twilight Samurai deals with a low-<br/>
ranking samurai who works as a humble clerk to support his elderly <br/>
mother and two young daughters. One day, to his dismay, he is <br/>
ordered by his lord to confront and kill an high-ranking warrior. No <br/>
ordinary samurai drama, Director Yamada Yioji's film is an <br/>
affecting, probing study of human relationships and of an individual <br/>
caught up in the upheavals of a changing world. The winner of <br/>
multiple awards in Japan, including "Best Picture," Twilight Samurai <br/>
is the 75th film by one of Japan's most successful and celebrated <br/>
filmmakers. In Japanese with English subtitles. <br/>
 <br/>
     Film screening in the College Center Forum at 7:30 p.m. <br/>
Admission for the general public is $5. For additional information <br/>
call 508-626-4985. <br/>
