<h3>doing something fun...</h3>

<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-36251170">ALERT!  Historic accuracy right out the window!  Read on if you dare!<br/>
<br/>
I've got so much churning around in my head that I need an outlet. <br/>
Well, I've dedicated my web comic to just such an outlet.  If you've<br/>
never heard of a "web comic", well its a sequential artwork story<br/>
(comic book) on the World Wide Web; hence web-comic.  eh? eh?  Nice huh :)<br/>
<br/>
anyway, here is something fun that some of you might enjoy reading...<br/>
its FREE... just me expressing my artistry.<br/>
<br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://banditt.uber-geek.us/web-comic.html">http://banditt.uber-geek.us/web-comic.html</a><br/>
<br/>
I'm trying to really recreate an authentic Manga.  I've bought "Manga<br/>
Studio" to do toner and between that and Photoshop, I'm getting some<br/>
nice effects.  All illustrations are HAND DRAWN.  I scan in my<br/>
manuscripts and then add the text and toner.<br/>
<br/>
If anyone has some feedback regarding the attempts, by golly, let me<br/>
have it! :)  I love hearing from folks and trying to make myself<br/>
better.  Who knows?  Maybe Tokyo Pop will pick me up down the road? <br/>
*dear God PLEASE let SOMEBODY pick me up, I NEED the steady work!* <br/>
And Please feel free to pass the word on, if you know someone who<br/>
might enjoy the story.<br/>
<br/>
thanks and as always, your humble little Sanada wanabe (pun),<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1163266527">Well you did ask for feedback.    <br/>
 <br/>
   First off; on your web site it says star  I am thinking that it should be start.  <br/>
 <br/>
  I am not to sure what the story is suppose to be about.  And the lines that are in the beginning or a little on the hokey side.  Although the art work is very good.  I am not sure about the monster thing.  Will be interesting to see what comes next and if it helps to make the story itself make more sense.   <br/>
 <br/>
  I will forward this post to my daughter; she is a Comic Book store owner and is friend with alot of people in the business.   She also has a screen name for this forum; but I have never scene her post on here.  Could be a first.   Keep at it.  I am certainly not saying that you do not have potential and the art work as I said before is very good.   I am thinking that there may be a market for a Historical Japanese comic book.  Sure would save alot of post on here LOL.   What a novel idea someone actually doing history.  <br/>
 <br/>
  Be well and many blessing   Seikei<br/>
