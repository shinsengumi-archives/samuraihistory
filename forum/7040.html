<h3>OT=Books on Japanese soldiers in WWII</h3>
by <i>cepooooo</i>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-498543091">I am doing research on Japanese soldiers' narratives of WWII, in <br/>
particular in Southeast Asia (thus NOT in China, Korea, Manchuria and <br/>
Pacific Islands) and I am wondering if some of you can suggest some <br/>
good book/website about the argument.<br/>
<br/>
I am interested in particular about the indoctrination of the soldiers <br/>
and their individual war experience, especially their interaction with <br/>
the place where they were fighting.<br/>
<br/>
I have already two dozen of books to go thru, but I am sure somebody <br/>
here might have some extra suggestion.<br/>
<br/>
And since I am asking, can anybody suggest a BASIC text/website of <br/>
general military history? I have realized I don't know 'exactly' what a <br/>
regiment is. :o(<br/>
<br/>
Thanks in advance, and sorry for the OT. If you are interested in my <br/>
research I will be glad to share it once it has been finished and <br/>
corrected by my professor.<br/>
<br/>
Thank you!!<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1449046046">Cepo, I know you said not China, but by a strange coincidence I had <br/>
been meaning to post to ask if you or any one else knew of a book <br/>
called Long the Imperial Way by Tasaki Hanama. A friend bought it for <br/>
me in a second hand bookshop. This copy was printed in 1951 and <br/>
went through several reprints immediately. I think the author must <br/>
have been nissei from Hawai who got conscripted into the Imperial <br/>
Army as the book was written in English.<br/>
<br/>
It's one of the best war books I've ever read and the descriptions of the <br/>
indoctrination and the brutality are quite detailed.  I wanted to know <br/>
more about Tasaki and what happened to him after the war.<br/>
<br/>
I'll see what else I can find from the Australia-Japan conflict <br/>
perspective.<br/>
<br/>
(and I would love to read the results)<br/>
<br/>
Cheers,<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1681083729">Gillian, I have found a copy from 1951 on half.com for $12.50 and I <br/>
have ordered it straight away. Actually, many Japanese soldiers who <br/>
fought in Burma had previously campaigned in China. However, unlike in <br/>
China (at least until 1943) they were ordered to behave well toward the <br/>
locals in Southeast Asia, since there they were a 'liberation army.' <br/>
But the training in China is definitely part of my research.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks for the tip!! I hope it's good!! :oD<br/>
