<div id="ygrps-yiv-782604081"><blockquote><span title="ireply">>6)Daimajin-a great samurai film all on its own, AND you get one of <br/>
>the most convincing Japanese giant monsters too! <br/>
><br/>
 </span></blockquote>While I think list members would enjoy this movie, it really in many <br/>
ways is a cheezy kids flick. There are at least three of them.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> >7)Hanzo The Razor:The Snare-a great break from the tired genre of <br/>
>noble ronin films. The Hanzo films work as drama, parody, comedy and <br/>
>chambara. <br/>
><br/>
 </span></blockquote>This is a truly bizarre film, I do think list members will enjoy it, <br/>
just don't let your 'gaki' watch it.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> >And for best Taiga drama-Toshiie & Matsu. OK, it's a `chick' Taiga <br/>
>drama, but Toshiie is such an engaging goof and Matsu is just plain <br/>
>adorable.<br/>

><br/>
 </span></blockquote>What about Musashi? Still T&M was much better than Shinsengumi.<br/>
<br/>
Other films about historical characters that I think are fun are Onmyoji <br/>
and one of the cheesiest ninja flicks, Sudden Death!<br/>
