 </span></blockquote>Your friend watches too many movies. Guns were<br/>
introduced to Japan via both the Portuguese in the<br/>
1540's and the Chinese in limited fashion prior to<br/>
that. By the 1550's there were gun factories in<br/>
several areas in Japan, and by the 1570's they were<br/>
producing more guns than Europe. Tell your friend to<br/>
look up the Battle of Nagashino, 1575--the Oda army<br/>
used 1,000 to 3,000 guns, depending on your source, in<br/>
a rotating volley fire, sometime before this became<br/>
standard practice in Europe. <br/>

overrated battle in Japanese history. The Takeda struggled on for<br/>
another 7 years - albeit heavily reduced in power - and the losses<br/>
suffered in the battle probably had a lot more to do with Katsuyori<br/>
being heavily outnumbered and in a poor strategic position than the use<br/>
of rifles by Nobunaga. The Takeda themselves had rifles, and I fancy<br/>
that they weren't idiotic enough to ride straight in to a wave of<br/>
gunfire ala the Nagashino scene in 'Kagemusha'. Katsuyori may not have<br/>
been as talented as his father, but I'm sure he wasn't as big a fool as<br/>
he tends to get credited for either.<br/>
 <br/>
Still, it probably is the most famous battle post-Kamakura, except for<br/>
maybe Sekigahara, which is far more interesting in my opinion.<br/>

<h3>Rebuttal on Nagashino</h3>

 </span></blockquote>Poor operational and tactical position, actually.<br/>
Looking at the battle in the terms of long term<br/>
effects isn't where the importance of this battle<br/>
lies; the beauty (speaking as a military officer) is<br/>
the design of the Oda plan, integrating terrain and<br/>
man-made obstacles with the firearms to defeat the<br/>
strength of the opponent. Taking into account recent<br/>
research which indicates that the Oda had 1,000, not<br/>
3,000, arquebuses, and that at most 3 ranks could have<br/>
shot in the time it took the Takeda to move from the<br/>
woodline, across the Rengogawa, and up to the Oda<br/>
palisades (thus nullifying the common image of<br/>
"rotating" fire mowing down the Takeda, since it<br/>
wouldn't have actually done more than one "rotation"),<br/>
Nobunaga's use of terrain is that much more<br/>
impressive. <br/>
<br/>
The Takeda themselves had<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> > rifles, and I fancy<br/>
> that they weren't idiotic enough to ride straight in<br/>

> gunfire ala the Nagashino scene in 'Kagemusha'.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>No one at this time had "rifles", as they hadn't been<br/>
invented yet. The arquebus was a smoothbore weapon.<br/>
And while the Nagashino scene in "Kagemusha" is<br/>
completely ridiculous, do not discount the effect of a<br/>
cavalry charge against unprotected arquebusiers. These<br/>
weren't machine guns, or even, as I said, rifles--one<br/>
shot, then you've got to take a significant amount of<br/>
time to reload. The distances involved clearly show<br/>
that even with 3 ranks firing "in rotation", at most<br/>
each rank got one shot off before the Takeda closed<br/>
the distance. Hardly a British gun square from the<br/>
Zulu Wars. Ordinarily, arquebus ashigaru weren't<br/>
behind palisades--at best they had nagaeyari (long<br/>
spears) protecting them, similiar to a European pike<br/>
and shot formation, but in 1575 this wasn't<br/>
necessarily standard yet. Add in the aura of the<br/>
Takeda Cavalry, and the fact that most ashigaru<br/>
(before Nobunaga made them a major factor in battle,<br/>
anyways) were poorly trained and disciplined, and<br/>
there was no real reason for the Takeda to expect they<br/>
couldn't succeed. <br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> > Katsuyori may not have<br/>

 </span></blockquote>See above. Correct. <br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> > Still, it probably is the most famous battle<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>If what you want is political repercussions, see<br/>
Sekigahara. Tactically, it bores me, while Nagashino<br/>
fascinates me. No one ever talks about the Sakai<br/>
Tadatsugu raid behind the Takeda, or the actual siege<br/>
of Nagashino itself--fascinating maneuvers. The Takeda<br/>
operation was sound, actually, had the traitor in<br/>
Okazaki Castle not been uncovered. <br/>

 <br/>
 </span></blockquote>Still, we are talking about a Takeda army that was outnumbered 2-to-1,<br/>
perhaps even more so. Numbers aren't everything of course, and it was<br/>
good strategy on the Oda's part in using the terrain as they did, but to<br/>
me it just seems that the Oda took the "obvious" strategy. As an army<br/>
coming to break a siege, they did what any army would have, or at least<br/>
should have, done.<br/>
 <br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> >No one at this time had "rifles", as they hadn't been<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Aye, It's a bad habit that I should break.<br/>
 <br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> >And while the Nagashino scene in "Kagemusha" is<br/>

>cavalry charge against unprotected arquebusiers. <br/>
 <br/>
 </span></blockquote>My problem is with the whole image of the samurai cavalry charge.<br/>
Supposedly mounted samurai dismounted in combat and didn't fight from<br/>
horseback and rarely, if ever, formed units of pure cavalry. This comes<br/>
from descriptions taken from They Came to Japan, the size of Japanese<br/>
horses, and comments by Prof. Karl Friday in several usenet posts.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> >...Add in the aura of the<br/>

>there was no real reason for the Takeda to expect they<br/>
>couldn't succeed. <br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Aye, I agree, I'm sure they did expect to win, especially considering<br/>
that the Takeda and Oda both believed that the Takeda army was more<br/>
numerous. But it wasn't, not even close in fact, and they were<br/>
thoroughly routed.<br/>
 <br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> >If what you want is political repercussions, see<br/>

 <br/>
 </span></blockquote>I find the events around the actual battle of Nagashino more interesting<br/>
than the battle itself, but maybe that's just my taste in history, which<br/>
might explain why I prefer Sekigahara to Nagashino. The story of how<br/>
Nobunaga learnt of the siege and came to break it is interesting, as is<br/>
the damage to the Takeda caused by the battle. Maybe hindsight is 20/20,<br/>
but the actual battle itself, once it took place, heavily favoured the<br/>
Oda and they came out on top. I don't find much interesting about it,<br/>
but again maybe that says more about my tastes in history than the<br/>
battle itself.<br/>
