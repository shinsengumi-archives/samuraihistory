<h3>Spectacles in Japan</h3>
by <i>deanwayland</i>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-393688015">Greetings All,<br/>
<br/>
Me and mine over here in England are re-enacting Japan 1543-1640, during<br/>
which period I know the Europeans had spectacles, but when did such<br/>
devices arrive or evolve in Japan. <br/>
<br/>
One of our members really needs his spec's and can't get on with contact<br/>
lenses and we'd prefer a historical solution. I understand that the<br/>
lenses of the era were designed to correct short sightedness, for<br/>
reading purposes only, but period frames with modern lenses would be<br/>
infinitely better than the two alternatives: modern glasses or nothing<br/>
at all, one blind player is enough:-) (me that is).<br/>
<br/>
Any help would be much appreciated.<br/>
<br/>
Yours<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>There's a very good book called The Lens within the Heart by Timon <br/>
Screech (CUP 1996 Curzon 2002) which gives lots of information about <br/>
spectacles in Japan. The first pair of glasses was said to have been <br/>
given to Ieyasu at the turn of the 16th c.  In 1636 spectacles accounted <br/>
for one percent of Dutch-Japanese trade: 19,425 pairs. They may not <br/>
have been very comfortable to wear. An encyclopaedia in 1732 <br/>
describes them: "glasses are about 3mm thick and look like the slices <br/>
of giant radish." Mainly it seems these were heavy ones put on by seal <br/>
carvers, inlayers etc to look closely at things. In former times they <br/>
came from China. Light glass lensed sort came from Europe.  This <br/>
book has various illustrations of  people wearing glasses.<br/>
<br/>
Professor Screech is in London, at the School of Oriental and African <br/>
studies, and everything I've ever written by him is marvellous, full of <br/>
insights. If you are in England you might be able to find out more.<br/>
<br/>
Hope this is of some help.<br/>

<h3>Spectacles in Japan</h3>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-685226875">Hi Gillian,<br/>
<br/>
Terrific, just what I needed thank you:-) I'll be ordering a copy ASAP.<br/>
<br/>
Co-incidentally, on Sunday I visited a re-enactors market, where by<br/>
chance there was a new stand, specialising in 16th and 17th century<br/>
reproduction spectacles, although he could not tell me anything about<br/>
glasses in Japan, he was very helpful with regard to the European forms.<br/>
<br/>
So once I've done my reading, and no doubt a trip down to SOAS etc. I'm<br/>
sure we'll be able to sort out all our spectacle problems. Thank you<br/>
again Gillian.  <br/>
<br/>
Yours<br/>
<br/>
Dean<br/>
