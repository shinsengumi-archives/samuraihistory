<div id="ygrps-yiv-435287184">Hi Jeff,<br/>
there were many different laws in many different places, it would depend on the time period as well as the diamyo. Although not laws if I had to choose two things that were expected of a samurai in all places and times it would be, obedience and loyalty these things were core to what a samurai should be, the word samurai even means "to serve".<br/>

<br/>
P.S. Even though a ronin had no lord to serve and be loyal and obiedient to this did not make him any less of a samurai.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-329165457">Well, aren't you just so smart, Dave. ^_^ There weren't very specific laws on Samurai, but there was only on consistency in their codes and rules. The Code of Bushido, which was a set of ten ideals for samurai set down for all with a sword to follow. I think they were given to someone by one of the Kami or gods/goddesses, but I can't quite remember the specifics. Go ahead and e-mail me if you need any more specifics on the subject. I spent a past life during some of feudal japan, and was alive during Sekigahara.<br/>

Hagakure isn't a book of law, it's a guide to behaviour written at the<br/>
end of the samurai era, and was relatively obscure at the time. It only<br/>
became popular in the 20th century, likewise all the other "Bushido" and<br/>
"ninja" nonsense. Don't fall in to the trap of these modern "myths".<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-2620579">Hi Nate - <br/>
<br/>
It's called 'living in the past' and happens to us all!<br/>
<br/>
Actually I agree with you.<br/>
<br/>
I've got an old video from a BBC TV series called 'Way of the Warrior' on the Katori <br/>
Shinto Ryu, and there's a snippet of Otake-sensei talking to his students, explaining <br/>
that the way of the warrior was NOT about rushing out and killing and being killed <br/>
without a moment's thought or hesitation.<br/>
<br/>
I think there's a psychological phenomena that endangers peacetime military (this is a <br/>
civilian talking here) when units with high reputations go to stupid lengths to prove <br/>
how 'hard' they are, the chance to do so in battle denied them.<br/>
<br/>
To me the Sengoku samurai was a pragmatic sort of chap. His Edo counterpart was <br/>
far more reactionary - although vanity, pride and sharp implements is inevitably an <br/>
incendiary mix in whatever era!<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I agree with Miburo. Bushido, literally translated "Way of the <br/>
Warrior," developed in Japan between the Heian and Tokugawa Ages (9th-<br/>
12th century). It was a code and way of life for Samurai, a class of <br/>
warriors similar to the medieval knights of Europe. It puts emphasis <br/>
on loyalty, self-sacrifice, justice, sense of shame, refined manners, <br/>
purity, modesty, frugality, martial spirit, honour and affection. <br/>
However before there was bushido I am not sure what laws were part of <br/>
the samurai culture, will check resource marital.</div>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I agree with Miburo. Bushido, literally translated "Way of the <br/>
Warrior," developed in Japan between the Heian and Tokugawa Ages (9th-<br/>
12th century). It was a code and way of life for Samurai, a class of <br/>
warriors similar to the medieval knights of Europe. It puts emphasis <br/>
on loyalty, self-sacrifice, justice, sense of shame, refined manners, <br/>
purity, modesty, frugality, martial spirit, honour and affection. <br/>
However before there was bushido I am not sure what laws were part of <br/>
the samurai culture, will check resource marital.   <br/>

<h3>Re: [samuraihistory] Re: laws of samurai</h3>
by <i>deanwayland</i>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1991292946">Hi,<br/>
<br/>
The notions of bushido, pre 17th century were very vague indeed, it<br/>
wasn't until 100 years after the battle of Sekigahara (1600), that the<br/>
first known attempt to codify and commit the ideas to paper was<br/>
undertaken. At that same time 1701 when the 47 ronin did their thing, it<br/>
caused a real headache for the government as, bushido, was just an<br/>
ideal, not something that you should really do! <br/>
<br/>
Okay, my own view is that the various ideas contained in bushido, along<br/>
with the obsessive reverence for the sword, over and above all other<br/>
weapons, especially the gun, was nothing more than a socio-political<br/>
device created by the Tokugawa intended to ensure peace. Which it<br/>
actually did, for nigh on 250 years, which isn't bad, bearing in mind<br/>
just how long they had all been kicking the "do do" out of one<br/>
another:-)<br/>
<br/>
Bushido crippled the samurai class, turning them from battle winning,<br/>
team playing "soldiers", unafraid to embrace new ideas and new<br/>
technologies to help them win, to nothing more than an ineffective and<br/>
quarrelsome bunch of individual "warrior-administrators", unable to<br/>
threaten the Tokugawa hegemony.<br/>
<br/>
I mean, look at the attitude to firearms, it is often said that the<br/>
Europeans wrecked the Japanese way of war by introducing them to the<br/>
gun, which the samurai of the Edo era then consequently rejected. Well<br/>
apart from the fact that we didn't introduce them to the gun at all,<br/>
they had it long before we got there, all we did was show them how to<br/>
make an iron screw thread (another story), there is the story from the<br/>
Korean campaign which if I recall correctly there's a letter from a<br/>
warrior stating something like "don't bother bringing swords, just bring<br/>
guns", which is a heck of a different attitude to the later samurai.<br/>
Again, the promotion of a distaine for firearms makes alot of sense if<br/>
you are the Tokugawa, hanging on to power by your fingernails.<br/>
<br/>
The whole sword thing, was blown out of all proportion, again I think to<br/>
aid the cause of peace, Tokugawa peace that is. To explain by way of an<br/>
analogy: if we translate the samurai in to the equivalent of today's<br/>
modern soldier, and then encouraged them to think of all weapons with<br/>
the exception of the pistol, as just work-a-day tools, and that "real<br/>
men" fight with hand guns, upon which they lavish great time effort and<br/>
expense, in mastering the art of the solo pistol shoot out, how<br/>
effective would they be when it came to waging a serious war as part of<br/>
a large army? Answer, see the Shinabara revolt 1638 and the cancellation<br/>
of the invasion of the Philipines, followed by the absolute sealing of<br/>
the country!<br/>
<br/>
I know that the above is a bit of a sweeping generalisation, but as such<br/>
I feel it to be a working hypothesis.<br/>
<br/>
Okay, ducking for cover:-)<br/>
<br/>
Yours<br/>
<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-425175034">Hi there Jim,<br/>
<br/>
Okay re the story of guns in Japan; firstly I need to put up a blanket<br/>
"IIRC" or "if I recall correctly", as otherwise there would have to be a<br/>
lot of that, since I'm dusting off parts of my memory which are seldom<br/>
trod. <br/>
<br/>
Some years ago I attended a seminar at the Royal Armouries in Leeds on<br/>
the topic of the latest research in to Japanese siege warfare. Present<br/>
were Thom Richardson (the then keeper of the oriental collection) who<br/>
was running the show and Stephen Turnbull, who would have been<br/>
accompanied by Ian Bottomley his co-conspirator, but Ian was down with a<br/>
vicious cold, so Stephen had to read Ian's notes to the assembled<br/>
masses.<br/>
<br/>
Basically, they stated that new evidence for the existence of firearms<br/>
pre 1543, had been recently (at that time) unearthed in Japan, which<br/>
included an account of Oda Nobunaga attending some function or other<br/>
with a small company (50) of gunners in his entourage.<br/>
<br/>
It seems that the discovery of the gun in the far east occurred at a<br/>
similar time as it did in the west. The earliest record of firearms here<br/>
is 1274 in Italy (blanket IIRC reminder). The difference between the two<br/>
lay in the technology of later gun making.<br/>
<br/>
In the east, no satisfactory method for sealing the breach of an iron<br/>
barrel was ever found, which meant they were restricted to cast bronze<br/>
for their guns. This means in turn that if you want a hand portable<br/>
weapon it couldn't be that powerful, for if it were, it would cease to<br/>
be "portable". So there early hand guns, were heavy bronze affairs with<br/>
relatively low power, hence the need for slower burning gun powder, as<br/>
per the Chinese type. It seems that gunners were in service, but in very<br/>
small numbers, with each man carrying only three or four rounds of ammo.<br/>
I guess it was deployed much like early guns were here, for intimidation<br/>
as much for effect.<br/>
<br/>
What got the Japanese so excited by European guns, wasn't the concept of<br/>
the gun itself, they had these, it was that ours were "light" and<br/>
comparatively powerful. The reason for this being that we could make a<br/>
barrel out of iron, which for a given weight, can take much higher<br/>
chamber pressures. So you could use a more potent gun powder mix, which<br/>
in turn meant that a hand gun would make a far more useful military<br/>
weapon.<br/>
<br/>
Now the first European iron guns were not plug sealed, being fitted with<br/>
a removable breach held in place by wedges. I've been around when one of<br/>
things has been used, and believe me reliable it is not! If you get it<br/>
wrong, bang, followed by flying wedges and a zippy breach! At the very<br/>
least they seal like a sieve doesn't, gas vents all over the place, thus<br/>
the muzzle loader won out over the early breach loader.<br/>
<br/>
The European genius was the ability to permanently seal an iron tube,<br/>
which we did with the creation of the iron "screw" in the 15th century.<br/>
Now the screw has been known for thousands of years, but all previous<br/>
examples were carved from other softer materials like wood. The early<br/>
iron and later steel screw had to be pains takingly built up around a<br/>
core with a "V" sectioned piece of wire or bar. I know a guy who has<br/>
done it, and it isn't easy at all. But once you know how.... BOOM!<br/>
<br/>
Consequently, its the art of making the screw-in breach plug, that<br/>
enables Japanese gun technology to go crazy, ramping up gun production<br/>
vastly within six months of its arrival, and the rest as they say is<br/>
history.<br/>
<br/>
Anyway, subject to the vagueries of memory, I hope this was of interest,<br/>
or at the very least entertaining.<br/>
<br/>
Yours<br/>
