<div id="ygrps-yiv-2064850498">Hi all,<br/>
 Ragarding the naming of the ships..They were named after the province of <br/>
Musashi and not the man. In actual Miyamoto Musashi was also named after the <br/>
province so the ships I guess followed his pattern and also the thousend <br/>
other 'Musashi' named Japanese out there in the past.<br/>
 It was common to use the name of the province or village where you were born <br/>
or raised as your name..But in Miyamoto Musashi his name is the province and <br/>
Miyamoto the surname. Takezo is anouther way to pronounce the Kanji used in <br/>
his name and may well have been a name that he used as well as 'Musashi'<br/>
 The ship 'Musashi' was one of a series of great Japanese ships that were <br/>
built and named after Japanese 'Kuni' or provinces..the 'Yamato' was another <br/>
one. I think the names were intended to bring up feelings of the greatness of <br/>
the Japanese navy at the time,,Similar to calling a ship the "U.S.S. George <br/>
Washington"..It was intended as inspiration.<br/>
 Hope this helps.<br/>
