<h3>Did Inahime actually exist?</h3>
by <i>cjdb_2002</i>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-874335170">I don't know much about Japanese History, but I came across this <br/>
character in Samurai Warriors XL, the videogame, and thought she was <br/>
amazing. The characters are usually based on historical figures but <br/>
I've checked around and i can't find out ANYTHING about Inahime, did <br/>
she even actually exist? Or was she made up for the game?<br/>
<br/>
On the Koei official website they give a little bio about her but I <br/>
don't know if thats real. On the Koei website, they mention that <br/>
Inahime actually took part in a real battle using her bow and that <br/>
threw me off because it wasn't a common occurence for women to take <br/>
to the battlefield in that era, right? <br/>
<br/>
So I just guessed that Koei made her up, or is she actually based on <br/>
a real life figure? Even if they did make her up, she's still the <br/>
best! <br/>
<br/>
Any information would be greatly appreciated! Thanx again!<br/>
<br/>
P.S. Here's what the bio Koei made of her:<br/>
<br/>
"The daughter of Tadakatsu Honda. She was adopted by Ieyasu <br/>
Tokugawa, and married Nobuyuki Sanada (Yukimura Sanada's<br/>
brother). <br/>
Ina was well liked by Ieyasu Tokugawa, and she often switched <br/>
allegiances between the Tokugawas and the Sanadas. On the eve of the <br/>
Battle of Sekigahara, the Sanada clan was divided between Eastern <br/>
and Western fronts. While Nobuyuki (who was allied with the <br/>
Tokugawas) was away, Masayuki and Yukimura Sanada visited Numata <br/>
Castle. Without opening the gates, she shot at them with her bow <br/>
from a turret and repelled their attempted entry. However, at the <br/>
war's conclusion, she asked Tadakatsu and Ieyasu to have mercy on <br/>
both Masayuki and Yukimura."</div>

 </span></blockquote>Inahime (1573?- 1620) certainly existed.   Her names appears in <br/>
historical sources<br/>
as Ine, Oine, Komatsudono and Dairenin.<br/>
<br/>
The bio provided by Koei and the game give you an impression that she <br/>
took a bow<br/>
herself but she just ordered to attack her father-in-law's army as proxy <br/>
for her<br/>
husband.  Real Inahime seems not to be a brave archer but a lady of wisdom.<br/>
When her husband (Eastern Sanada) sieged Ueda castle, where the Western <br/>
Sanada<br/>
had defended,  she invited the defender's families into her castle on an <br/>
excuse of<br/>
protecting  weak people and offer her hospitaility to them.  This deed <br/>
functioned<br/>
in two ways; taking hostages and decreasing casualities in divided <br/>
Sanada clan<br/>
and its vassals.  And she was so uncompromising that she mentiond her <br/>
thought<br/>
directly even to Ieyasu TOKUGAWA and Hidetada TOKUGAWA.<br/>
<br/>
