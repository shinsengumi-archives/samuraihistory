<h3>Japanese Culture</h3>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-6308319">Hello to everybody,<br/>
<br/>
I am a subscriber from Spain very interested in<br/>
martial arts and Japanese culture, I have never been<br/>
in Japan, and I hope to go there one day. As I've seen<br/>
for last two years this group is populated with a lot<br/>
of people that have a very good knwoledge about Japan<br/>
and about its history, so I throw you a question that<br/>
may be some of you can answer. Recently I've listened<br/>
about the compund japanese term Yamato Damashii, I've<br/>
tried to find some information about but haven't<br/>
succeed too much, I think that is somtehing about<br/>
japanese patriotic, ethics, feelings, ...<br/>
<br/>
¿could you explain briefly what does Yamato Damashii<br/>
mean?<br/>
<br/>
¿can you recomend me some reading or book about this?<br/>
<br/>
Thanks in advance and happy 2006 to everybody<br/>
