 </span></blockquote>It's fairly simple, really. One (or more) layers of really heavy paper were laid <br/>
down over a form and lacquered to within an inch of their lives. I've seen some <br/>
really impressive modern jingasa made in that way where the "core" is just a <br/>
single layer of what amounts to posterboard glued into shape (e.g., either a <br/>
single piece that's rolled into a cone and secured with glue or staples [!], or <br/>
several pie-wedge shapes likewise attached, and then lacquered with eight or ten <br/>
layers of lacquer. These things end up about 1/4" thick or more, and are hard as <br/>
a rock.<br/>
