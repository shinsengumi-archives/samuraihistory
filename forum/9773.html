<h3>Exile to Sado Island - How does it work?</h3>

<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1272087690">RPG related question for an Alt-History campaign set on the eve of <br/>
the Onin War... I'll have more questions if this proves useful. <br/>
<br/>
I have read that a wide variety of noted worthies were all exiled to <br/>
Sado Island, apparently to work in mines or something. I also note <br/>
that it was considered a one way trip. How does that work, exactly?  <br/>
I see that it was ruled by the Homma clan for the relevant period. <br/>
Did they act as jailers for the court and Shogunate? Did only people <br/>
that it was impolitic to execute get sent there? <br/>
<br/>
I have the following hypothetical examples in my mind's eye:<br/>
<br/>
#1 "Prince Okisugi no Guchi offends the Emperor one too many times <br/>
with his scandalous gossip, and he is ordered to relocate to Sado <br/>
Island. His estates forfeit, the prince is escorted by a retinue of <br/>
Imperial guardsmen across Japan, taking only what his four or five <br/>
servants will carry. After many weeks of travel, during which he is <br/>
given opportunities to end his own life with dignity, he is loaded <br/>
onto a boat and transferred to Homma custody, where he is received as <br/>
an honored guest... meaning he lives out his days in a decrepit <br/>
seaside house with one loyal servant, writing his memoirs. He does <br/>
not escape, because if he does, he will be executed, or something bad <br/>
might happen to his relatives in Kyoto, or his considerable remaining <br/>
dignity will be squandered. "<br/>
<br/>
#2 "Priest Yominikui offends the Shogun one too many times with his <br/>
atrocious poetry. It is considered bad form to kill a priest who is <br/>
distantly related to Lord Yamana Sozen, so he is instead slapped in <br/>
chains, carted to the boat, and shipped to Sado Island. There he is <br/>
far too busy digging in the Homma silver mines to write poems. Priest <br/>
Yominikui eventually expires under the strain of his new labors." <br/>
<br/>
Would it be plausible for PC's to be sent to Sado by a powerful <br/>
patron to retrieve some old noble, because he was needed for the <br/>
brewing Onin intrigues? Or perhaps simply for a PC to carry a private <br/>
letter from one powerful person to an exiled Imperial relative, <br/>
seeking support for some power play?<br/>
<br/>
Thanks, <br/>
