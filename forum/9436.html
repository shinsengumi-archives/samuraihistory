<h3>seeking info on Sanada clan</h3>
by <i>banditt_adams</i>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1080705520">Hello!<br/>
<br/>
Im brand new to the boards, so please forgive me if Ive missed a<br/>
question similar to this.<br/>
<br/>
I am seeking to learn anything I can about the Sanada family, who were<br/>
Takeda retainers from the mid 1500s to the late 1500s.  They had a<br/>
very famous member, Sanada Yukimura.  They existed in the Shinano<br/>
province.<br/>
<br/>
Of coarse Ive read everything the Samurai archives has and Ive read<br/>
the wiki info on Takeda shingen and the Sandas proper.  Ive gone over<br/>
the "general info" books so prevailant in the libraries, but Im having<br/>
trouble finding specific info on the Sanada themselves, despite being<br/>
quite a famous family!  Im trying to get some books on Kawanakajima as<br/>
well, but our library doesnt carry osprey :)<br/>
<br/>
I only do English :(  poor Gaijin that I am.  <br/>
<br/>
If anyone has some good books or other media to point me to, please do<br/>
so! :)  I would be extremely appreciative.  <br/>
<br/>
As a side note, Im engaging this project for the purpose of living<br/>
history.  Ive been involved in loving history education for almost 13<br/>
years doing American Civil War and until the last couple of years,<br/>
WWII.  Ive set my sights on something that isnt done a lot, especially<br/>
on the Eastern part of the U.S.  I dig "dresing up" and doing<br/>
conferences at high schools and elementary schools (the little ones<br/>
*love* it) and the like and I think World history teachers would<br/>
really get a kick out of me bringing in a samurai kit!  Ive done my<br/>
Civil War schpeel at quite a few schools and I need something fresh<br/>
thats more my thing.  I like Civil War, but Im a real nut for this!<br/>
<br/>
Ive been studying sengoku jidai for a few yeas now.  Ive poured<br/>
through turnbull and bottomly and a few translated works.  I am<br/>
recreating my own gear as authentically as possible.  Im on another<br/>
yahoo group e-list and Ive bounced some questions off of a board or<br/>
two.  Any little bit helps!!<br/>
<br/>
Anyway, if anyone has books that deal with "daily life" articles, I<br/>
would love to learn of those too.  Turnbulls' "Samurai Sourcebook" is<br/>
my favorite!<br/>
<br/>
Kindest regards!<br/>
-Jason</div>

all the major places to look, read the biographies - can you come up<br/>
with any specific questions?<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1395002466">If I can remember, I will check out some of the shrines in the Osaka-jo, Tennoji area next week. There is a statue of Yukimura at Sanko Jinja and his place of death is supposedly at Yusui Jinja. Otherwise, you should check with the prefectural museums and sources like that... It seems like you already have the basic info.<br/>

<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Turnbull's "Samurai Sourcebook" is more than likely to have info on <br/>
the Sanada clan, have you tried there? <br/>
Also, I remember at least one website entirely dedicated to Sanada <br/>
Yukimura, but I guess you will probably already have "googled" all <br/>
the "googlable".<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> >I am<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Then look for Anthony J. Bryant and the Society for Creative <br/>
Anachronism:<br/>
<br/>
www.sengokudaimyo.com<br/>
<br/>
The site doesn't look like it's been updated recently, but it does <br/>
contain tons of awesome stuff. <br/>
<br/>
Good luck!<br/>

<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1529690804">Well, questions such as.....<br/>
<br/>
1). Did the Sanada *rule* shinano or just exist there?  In Turnbulls<br/>
book on daimyo he has some EXCELLENT shots of the Sanada mansion and<br/>
Im uber happy there :)  They must have been very prominent.<br/>
<br/>
2).  Did all soldiers have a sashimono of red with 6 black coins?  Are<br/>
there any variants?<br/>
<br/>
3).  On the flags, are the black coins with circular holes, square or<br/>
rectangle?  Ive seen all in illustrations, but IVe seen no original<br/>
flags :( <br/>
<br/>
4).  Are there any museums with original Sanda artifacts?  I found a<br/>
website that seems to have a lot of Takeda and some Sanda stuff...<br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.yamamotokansuke.com/shiro/tenzan/index.htm">http://www.yamamotokansuke.com/shiro/tenzan/index.htm</a><br/>
<br/>
5).  What city were the Sanada from? <br/>
<br/>
6).   What castles did the Sanada hold?<br/>
<br/>
7).  How well did the Sanada get along with the other retainer<br/>
families?  Any rivalries?  I know the Akiyama held a castle in<br/>
Shainano for a while.<br/>
<br/>
8).  Toishi castle (1550) is supposed to be "well documented"<br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://folk.uio.no/arnsteio/samurai/sanada/SanadaYukitaka.shtml">http://folk.uio.no/arnsteio/samurai/sanada/SanadaYukitaka.shtml</a>  where<br/>
can I find recounts of this siege?<br/>
<br/>
9).  Im looking for specific numbers of troop types at any one time. <br/>
I have seen a couple Takeda battle lists, but it concentrated mostly<br/>
on horses.  <br/>
<br/>
10).  Any clan-specific facts; more than just the Bio of certain people.<br/>
<br/>
thanks,<br/>
