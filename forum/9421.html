<h3>Just a general opinion query here?</h3>

<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1783960424">Accordng to Google and wikipedia the first firearms in Japan were <br/>
flintlocks and they came in around 1545 which would fit in with Yuyu<br/>
(spelling)Shina's carrying one albeit a nonsensical one in 1604-four <br/>
years after Sekigahara. Some sources say guns came to Japan earlier and <br/>
some say later like 1700's at a great battle or siege. What is agreed <br/>
on however is the banning and discouragement of using firearms for a <br/>
good two centuries thereafter. Did they use guns in 1615 at the uniting <br/>
of the clans battle, I wonder? I sometimes wonder if on InuYasha what <br/>
would have happened to her world of the 20th/21st Centuries if Kagome <br/>
had brought modern day weapons like state of the arts firearms to the <br/>
Warring States Era when she visited IY and friends? Maybe the youkai <br/>
and hanyou would be running the world today and judging from <br/>
appearances, could they have done as badly as our modern leaders have? <br/>
I think not. Why? They are not politically motivated and care not a <br/>
whit about ruling (Naraku excluded) the world. More soon. Have a nice <br/>
weekend and Kami bless you all. Ja Mata and Toodles-K&K</div>

Chinese made guns showed up a little earlier, but didn't take on a<br/>
wider use until the portugese guns showed up.  Any source that says<br/>
that guns didn't show up until the 1700's is absolutely wrong, and you<br/>
should throw it away (or close the webpage), unless they were throwing<br/>
rocks at Nagashino in 1575. It is documented historical fact that<br/>
Western guns showed up in the 1540's. </span></blockquote></div>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-409791904">it is well documentent that rifles first came to japan in 1542 with <br/>
portugues trader who shipwrecked on tanegashima island...and so hence the <br/>
name for new weapon.so ,put an end to this 1700's discussion etc..regards <br/>
