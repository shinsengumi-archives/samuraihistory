<div id="ygrps-yiv-1990957719">For the most part, that is the case from what I have seen. I have also read in numerous places that the longer more curved blade was created as a cavalry weapon to maximize the damage dealt to an opponent while on horseback..which is why it was worn blade down instead of blade up like a katana or wakazashi.<br/>

<h3>[samuraihistory] Re: swords</h3>

<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1991378464">Armour 3(san)-<br/>
	Remember that "tachi koshirae" properly refers to the <br/>
scabbard and handle while tachi alone is the style of blade, here I <br/>
will use it to include both. The tachi evolved into the blade down, <br/>
cavalry sword worn by emperors and generals in the late Heian / early <br/>
Kamakura period. There is some debate about the dating and the <br/>
reasons for it assuming the shape it did. I still agree with the idea <br/>
that it was developed as a cavalry weapon. Chinese and Korean <br/>
straight bladed swords that came to Japan in earlier times were worn <br/>
"slung" from the belt and this custom was followed with the Japanese <br/>
tachi that developed from them. I don't think the edge down sword was <br/>
something "new" that was found to aid a mounted warrior.<br/>
	In the earliest days there was little distinction between <br/>
courtier and warrior, but by the Kamakura period there was a distinct <br/>
warrior class. The tachi they wore were heavier and less ornate than <br/>
the Kazari-tachi worn at court. While we think of better swords and <br/>
koshirae in the "tachi" class there were in fact many "workin-man's" <br/>
tachi with plain iron fittings and leather wrapped tsuka and saya.<br/>
	While mounted combat gave way to large scale infantry <br/>
battles, generals and cavlry units continued to wear the tachi as <br/>
side arm. "Fighting" tachi were worn right up until the end of the <br/>
Sengoku Jidai and High ranking persons wore tachi right up until the <br/>
Meiji Restoration. What your sword will llok like will depend on what <br/>
period you want to recreate. I am happy to help if I can,<br/>
Tom<br/>
(obviously the sword nut...)<br/>

<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-121592696">Armour 3-<br/>
	The question is, is your armour for a mounted warrior or for <br/>
a foot soldier. By that time in history the uchi-katana was the most <br/>
common side-arm worn edge up thru the belt, often with a shorter <br/>
blade making a pair.<br/>
	For "officers", iron fittings leather covered scabbard, silk <br/>
or leather wrapped handle nothing fancy. For generals one would <br/>
expect to see brightly colored ito-maki tachi, perhaps with lacquered <br/>
mon. At this time there were many high-ranking individuals who were <br/>
very serious about war, and may have dressed gaudily, wore <br/>
eye-catching helmets but their swords were all business.<br/>
	Remember the Japannese put great store in the power of their <br/>
ancestors so a man in the 1500's might very well be wearing his great <br/>
grandfathers tachi, cut down and carried in a new scabbard...<br/>

Try www.ikkyudo.com , www.nihonto.com or www.sho-shin.com  for some fine<br/>
original Japanese swords. How much a pre revolution sword costs depends<br/>
entirely on the sword and what condition it is in.<br/>
