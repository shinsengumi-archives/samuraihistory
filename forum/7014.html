This may sound extremely picky, but it's an annoyance<br/>
for those of us who speak Japanese. In the original<br/>
title of this thread, the first questioner wrote<br/>
"Geishas". Japanese words do not get an "s" added to<br/>
them to make them plural; it's understood by context.<br/>
The plural of "Geisha" is "Geisha". This is still the<br/>
case even when speaking in English. You can meet one<br/>
Geisha, or you can see many Geisha walking down the<br/>
street. You wouldn't see many Geishas. Similarly, you<br/>
could meet a samurai, or you could go drinking with<br/>
many samurai, but you'd never run into several<br/>
"samurais". <br/>
<br/>
Minor point, possibly, but it helps you sound like you<br/>
know what you are talking about if you can correctly<br/>
use the words. <br/>
<br/>
Thanks,<br/>

Anyway, you are right (of course).<br/>
<br/>
Let me add that even today in Kyoto, a very hierarchy-conscious city, <br/>
you always refer to maiko and/or geiko and the term geisha is used only <br/>
to try to attract tourists.<br/>
<br/>
Okini!!<br/>

<br/>
True enough about "Geisha" not being used in Kyoto.<br/>
And of course you never actually *SEE* any--the ones<br/>
prancing along in the streets are usually maiko<br/>
anyways. <br/>
