Your assessment (even if it were true) might be less undesirable than 'all<br/>
heart, no brain.'  But the truth about Tony, I think, is more 'all research,<br/>
no bullshit.'  At that, I'm guessing he'd be happy enough to settle for<br/>
'reasonably close to history ...and still no bullshit.'  (I don't think<br/>
Tony's b.s. tolerance is very high.  One of the things we love about him.)<br/>
If the spirit of the film were moderately accurate, he might be inclined to<br/>
make allowances.  Let me put this another way:  do you actually _like_<br/>
movies that distort history and strain - or defy - credibility?<br/>

 </span></blockquote>They lie. There is so much that's wrong with it historically that I almost<br/>
cried. Yeah, the armour's pretty. Yeah, the battles are fancy. But<br/>
historically<br/>
it was totally crapola.<br/>
<br/>
Frankly, I'd think that Watanabe Ken and Sanada Hiroyuki ought to be<br/>
embarrassed. They've each made dozens of films -- some crappy, some really<br/>
good<br/>
-- and the one they get international reputations for is this American<br/>
"Dances<br/>
With Samurai" piece of steaming, fetid poop.<br/>
<br/>
I finally caught it on HBO last night, after months and months of refusing<br/>
to go<br/>
pay to see it, rent it, or buy it.<br/>
<br/>
It made me sick.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>It's part of the reason why I can really enjoy "Shakespeare in Love" -- which <br/>
makes no pretense as to being "the real story" -- while I abhor, loathe, detest, <br/>
and excoriate "Elizabeth," which *does* pretend to be history. I also hate <br/>
"Braveheart" for the same reasons, for what it's worth. <G><br/>
