<h3>NHK Historical Dramas</h3>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1854936338">Hi... I was wondering if anyone here's watching the weekly Historical <br/>
dramas of NHK.  I've been watching them since my college days starting <br/>
with th "Aoi" series.  Just a question, how accurate are they?  I've <br/>
been mostly intrigued with the "Toshiie to Matsu" series back in 2002, <br/>
and I'm wondering if Hideyoshi and Toshiie were really that connected <br/>
as protrayed in the series.  (Obviously I'm a fan of the Sengoku Jidai)<br/>
Thanks...</div>

 </span></blockquote>I've watched quite a few of them. Most are based on novelized <br/>
historical fiction, so they are a mix of history, known or accepted <br/>
myth, with added modern twists to interest the next generation and <br/>
women in them.  Such things as Mori Motonari's dedication to Mii-no-<br/>
kata and swearing off concubines is pure fiction (from Mori Motonari), <br/>
but tossed in to make it more date-friendly I suppose.</div>

 </span></blockquote>There usually pretty good but in the case of many of the characters they <br/>
have to invent many details. Sometimes they alter history to make a <br/>
better story like when Hideyoshi watches Goemen boil, it never happened <br/>
but they were plot friends. Yoshitsune and Musashi had a fair amount of <br/>
this as well, still they were great! Much better than Shinsengumi. The <br/>
current one is OK but not a knockout. Next best thing to chanbara....<br/>
