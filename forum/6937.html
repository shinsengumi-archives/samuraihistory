<div id="ygrps-yiv-1897756203">There is at least one in the sca its called the Genji clan <br/>
(<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://members.aol.com/arashisan/clan.html.">http://members.aol.com/arashisan/clan.html.</a>  I have only had a small <br/>
amount of contact with them (being in Amtgard not the SCA)but I do <br/>
belive that they are active.  Amtgard does have a few Japanese clans <br/>
as well Clan Wakagashira (<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://wakagashira.com/clan)">http://wakagashira.com/clan)</a> and Clan Raion <br/>
(<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://clanraion.qtneb.org/)">http://clanraion.qtneb.org/)</a>.<br/>
<br/>
Hope it helps <br/>
