<br/>
The Way of the Samurai, Followed by a New Master<br/>
<br/>
By A. O. SCOTT<br/>
<br/>
Published: July 23, 2004<br/>
<br/>
The hero of "The Blind Swordsman: Zatoichi" is a sightless fighter <br/>
who wanders through feudal Japan in the guise of an itinerant <br/>
masseur. Though he may be unfamiliar to most American audiences, <br/>
Zatoichi is a fixture in the pop culture of his native land, having <br/>
been the subject, from 1962 to 1989, of 26 movies and scores of <br/>
television episodes. (An ample selection of the movies is available <br/>
in subtitled DVD versions from Home Vision Entertainment.)<br/>
<br/>
In all of them â" including "Zatoichi at the Blood Fest," "Zatoichi <br/>
Meets Yojimbo" and "Zatoichi Meets the One-Armed Swordsman" â" <br/>
Zatoichi was played by Shintaro Katsu, who died in 1997. Now Takeshi <br/>
Kitano, a monument of Japanese popular culture in his own right, has <br/>
taken up Katsu's sword in an act of brutal, loving homage.<br/>
<br/>
Mr. Kitano, also known as Beat Takeshi, is a genre director who has, <br/>
with movies like "Sonatine," "Kikujiro" and "Brother," acquired the <br/>
cachet of an international art-house star. He has specialized in <br/>
variations on the yakuza gangster film, which makes "The Blind <br/>
Swordsman" something of a departure because Mr. Kitano has traded in <br/>
the yakuza's big pistols and dark suits for samurai swords and <br/>
traditional kimonos. But his new film, which opens today in New York <br/>
after winning prizes at festivals in Venice, Toronto, Marrakesh and <br/>
Catalonia (as well as five Japanese Academy Awards), retains many of <br/>
the hallmarks of his directing style. The grisly mayhem is balanced <br/>
by a quiet, precise sense of formal decorum, and a brutal, vengeful <br/>
worldview coexists with a disarmingly sentimental moralism.<br/>
<br/>
Above all, there is Mr. Kitano himself, with his heavily lined, <br/>
impassive countenance and his bowlegged, stoop-shouldered grace. He <br/>
uses Zatoichi's blindness to emphasize the rocklike stillness that <br/>
makes him scary and charismatic. His natural grimace occasionally <br/>
twitches into a grin as he anticipates the next fight.<br/>
<br/>
And there are plenty of those, because Zatoichi inhabits a world <br/>
overrun with corrupt gang bosses and their mercenary minions, most of <br/>
whom he dispatches with geysers of bright blood and overdubbed grunts <br/>
and moans. He is aided by a hapless, good-hearted gambler and by a <br/>
pair of geishas, one of them a transvestite, who are determined to <br/>
avenge the murder of their parents many years earlier.<br/>
<br/>
The swordfighting sequences are more a matter of efficient carpentry <br/>
(or butchery, if you prefer) than inspired choreography, but there is <br/>
nonetheless a certain elegance to Mr. Kitano's methods. For all his <br/>
glowering deadpan, he is not without wit, in his Keatonesque acting <br/>
and in his direction. At several points, as if subliminally riffing <br/>
on the significance of the nickname Beat, he mischievously <br/>
synchronizes onscreen noises with Keiichi Suzuki's score, turning <br/>
offhand moments into self-contained musical numbers that foreshadow <br/>
the full-scale song-and-dance explosion that comes as soon as the <br/>
last bad guy has been killed.<br/>
<br/>
Like many musicals, "The Blind Swordsman" works better in individual <br/>
scenes than as a whole. Mr. Kitano is not the most disciplined <br/>
storyteller, and the plot meanders along tangents and stumbles into <br/>
flashbacks, losing momentum for long stretches in the middle. It <br/>
often feels like many episodes of a serial compressed into a single <br/>
feature. This may, in the end, be easier to digest than 25 sequels <br/>
and a hundred hours of television. It may also whet your appetite for <br/>
more.<br/>
<br/>
"The Blind Swordsman: Zatoichi" is rated R (Under 17 requires <br/>
accompanying parent or adult guardian) for many bloody fight scenes.<br/>
