Information disclosure law reveals uncertainty over emperor's graves<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
A law enacted six years ago has given historians a new powerful <br/>
weapon to challenge a long-held taboo preserved by the Imperial <br/>
Household Agency: investigating the secrets of ancient emperors' <br/>
tombs.<br/>
<br/>
The weapon is the public information disclosure law, which has <br/>
allowed Noboru Toike, assistant professor at Den-en Chofu University <br/>
and an expert on Imperial tombs, to access and obtain copies of <br/>
internal agency documents.<br/>
<br/>
The documents suggest that the agency, despite official denials, <br/>
once conducted academic studies to review the attributions for at <br/>
least 10 ancient tombs that it claims belong to emperors from the <br/>
early fifth century to the early 13th century.<br/>
<br/>
Toike's discovery made headlines because it supported a widespread <br/>
belief by historians and archaeologists that the government's <br/>
designations of ancient burial mounds as the tombs of emperors were <br/>
made on shaky grounds.<br/>
<br/>
"These (documents) show the agency itself had questioned its own <br/>
attributions of the tombs, and conducted academic research on them <br/>
at least until around 1958," Toike told The Japan Times.<br/>
<br/>
"But today, the agency does not allow (scholars) to enter or <br/>
excavate (emperors') tombs for academic research. Their position has <br/>
receded" from decades past, when the documents were compiled, Toike <br/>
said.<br/>
<br/>
According to the Imperial Household Agency, there are 112 burial <br/>
mounds nationwide for all 124 past emperors, including Jinmu, the <br/>
mythical first emperor, and Hirohito, the 124th, who fathered <br/>
today's Emperor Akihito.<br/>
<br/>
Some of the tombs contain the remains of more than one emperor.<br/>
<br/>
But the consensus of Japanese archaeologists and historians is that <br/>
the government's claims on most of the ancient "Imperial" tombs are <br/>
academically unacceptable because they lack scientific grounds.<br/>
<br/>
Most of the tombs were designated as emperors' tombs in the late <br/>
19th century, just as Japan was trying to establish a modern state <br/>
centered on the emperor to compete with the Western powers. The <br/>
designations on many of the tombs relied on references found in <br/>
ancient documents and folk legends.<br/>
<br/>
According to Koichi Mori, a tomb expert and professor at Doshisha <br/>
University, archaeologists have found that only two of the <br/>
government's designations for the 42 tombs said to contain emperors <br/>
who reigned before and during the Kofun (burial mound) Period from <br/>
the third to seventh centuries are acceptable.<br/>
<br/>
The two are the tomb of Tenji, the 38th emperor, in Kyoto, and a <br/>
tomb in Nara where the 40th emperor, Tenmu, and the 41st emperor, <br/>
Jito, are buried together.<br/>
<br/>
"Usually in Japan, no epitaphs were placed in ancient tombs to <br/>
identify their occupants," Toike said.<br/>
<br/>
"So you can't determine the occupant of an ancient tomb with hard <br/>
evidence. All you can do is to establish a hypothesis by examining <br/>
the form of the tombs, unearthed articles, historical documents and <br/>
related geographical names," he said.<br/>
<br/>
The route to Toike's discovery started two years ago, when he bought <br/>
an old mimeographed booklet at a secondhand bookstore in Tokyo.<br/>
<br/>
Toike, taking advantage of the information disclosure law, obtained <br/>
a copy of the same booklet from the Imperial Household Agency but <br/>
found it had additional pages and handwritten memos.<br/>
<br/>
Some of the pages in the agency's copy were dated 1958 -- an <br/>
indication the relevant studies were conducted at least until that <br/>
year, according to the scholar.<br/>
<br/>
The copy included a list of "reference places" managed by the <br/>
Imperial Household Agency. In the terminology of the agency, <br/>
reference places refer to ancient tombs whose occupants have not <br/>
been identified but could possibly contain a member of the Imperial <br/>
family.<br/>
<br/>
The list divided the reference places into four categories, <br/>
depending on the degree of likelihood that the occupant is from the <br/>
Imperial family.<br/>
<br/>
The list included nine sites designated as possible emperor mounds <br/>
that were ranked "2-A" or "2," meaning their chances of authenticity <br/>
were one below the top category.<br/>
<br/>
"I was surprised because the agency has consistently explained <br/>
that 'reference places' are described as such because they have no <br/>
idea who their occupants are," Toike said.<br/>
<br/>
As he examined the booklet, Toike also learned about a special <br/>
expert committee established in 1935 by the predecessor to the <br/>
Imperial Household Agency to examine the ancient tombs.<br/>
<br/>
After obtaining more copies of agency documents concerning the <br/>
committee, Toike found that it concluded that an ancient tomb in <br/>
Takatsuki, Osaka Prefecture, should be designated as a reference <br/>
place because it could be the tomb of Emperor Keitai, who reigned <br/>
during the sixth century. The agency officially said Keitai is <br/>
buried in the city of Ibaraki in the same prefecture.<br/>
<br/>
Toike stressed the importance of conducting scientific probes on <br/>
ancient tombs, noting they could unlock a number of historical <br/>
mysteries related to ancient Japan.<br/>
<br/>
Most large tombs were built during the Kofun Period, when the <br/>
Imperial regime was in the process of creating the first unified <br/>
state that would control much of Japan for the first time, he said.<br/>
<br/>
Japanese historians have long and repeatedly demanded that the <br/>
government allow them to conduct excavations of the "emperor" tombs.<br/>
<br/>
Claiming that the "peace and calm" of the late emperors must be <br/>
maintained, however, the Imperial Household Agency has refused to <br/>
allow any excavation or scientific review of any of the tombs <br/>
designated as being those of past emperors.<br/>
<br/>
The agency argues that excavations of the burial sites <br/>
are "tantamount to destruction" of the tombs, where the Imperial <br/>
family has performed traditional religious rites in honor of their <br/>
ancestors.<br/>
<br/>
But Toike said: "The tombs should be first treated as historical <br/>
sites to be studied and preserved under the Cultural Properties <br/>
Protection Law."<br/>
