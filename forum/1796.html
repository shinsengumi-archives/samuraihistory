<h3>Mini Series Shogun</h3>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-985917180">I am new to this group so perhaps this topic has been covered <br/>
already. At the time Shogun first was shown on television, I was <br/>
studying Japanese language at a Berliotz school. I thought watching <br/>
the show would help me with my language studies. I quickly learned <br/>
that I did not recognize any of the Japanese words used on the show. <br/>
Somewhat disappointed, I mentioned it to my instructor, a Japanese <br/>
woman. She told me the reason I did not know any words was because <br/>
they actually spoke the Japanese language used during that period. <br/>
This amazed me. It seems to me that that is going above and beyond <br/>
normal efforts to make a show authentic. <br/>
<br/>
Shortly after this experience on a visit to Japan I actual saw pilots <br/>
hills. This brought me the realization, like nothing else could have <br/>
done, that the show was based upon real events.<br/>
<br/>
P.S. Shogun is my all time favorite mini series and I checked it out <br/>
of the library to watch tonight, again.</div>
