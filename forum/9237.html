<h3>Samurai Wiki&#39;s Most Wanted</h3>
by <i>kitsuno</i>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1924157601">Currently we need volunteers to fill out some categories on the<br/>
SamuraiWiki, so if anyone is interested come and sign up:<br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://wiki.samurai-archives.com/">http://wiki.samurai-archives.com/</a><br/>
<br/>
PLEASE READ THE HELP SECTIONS IF YOU ARE NOT FAMILIAR WITH EDITING<br/>
WIKI ARTICLES:<br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://wiki.samurai-archives.com/index.php?title=SamuraiWiki:Help">http://wiki.samurai-archives.com/index.php?title=SamuraiWiki:Help</a><br/>
People who contribute without reading the help sections consistently<br/>
and always make a mess that the Admins have to take time formatting<br/>
and cleaning up. Please save us the trouble and browse similar<br/>
articles to the one you want to create so that we don't have to clean<br/>
up and reformat your article because you didn't follow the standards<br/>
and formats.<br/>
<br/>
When you sign up, if you do not contribute anything for a day or two,<br/>
you will find a verification box on your user page. If you do not<br/>
remove it within 15 days, your account will be blocked as inactive and<br/>
a possible spam account.  If it is blocked in error, email me, and I<br/>
will unblock it as soon as possible.  This is only done to prevent<br/>
spam accounts. Once you remove the box from your user page, or if you<br/>
contribute, you will be verified permanently.  If you don't think you<br/>
will contribute for a long time, or at all, don't create an account<br/>
until you are ready to contribute. You do not need to create an<br/>
account in order to read and browse articles.<br/>
<br/>
Also, plagarism is absolutely not tolerated, and sources must always<br/>
be cited.  Failure to do so may result in banning.<br/>
<br/>
Here are some categories that need volunteers to create articles,<br/>
however any articles are always appreciated:<br/>
<br/>
Fiction Books<br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://wiki.samurai-archives.com/index.php?title=Category:Fiction_Books">http://wiki.samurai-archives.com/index.php?title=Category:Fiction_Books</a><br/>
Including Citation info, synopsis, and purchase links.<br/>
<br/>
Bujutsu articles<br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://wiki.samurai-archives.com/index.php?title=Category:Bujutsu">http://wiki.samurai-archives.com/index.php?title=Category:Bujutsu</a><br/>
A lot of the articles are small stubs and also need sources. If you<br/>
want to help out with the Bujutsu articles, feel free to join the<br/>
"Bujutsu Task Force":<br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://wiki.samurai-archives.com/index.php?title=SamuraiWiki:Bujutsu_task_force">http://wiki.samurai-archives.com/index.php?title=SamuraiWiki:Bujutsu_task_force</a><br/>
<br/>
Movies: <br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://wiki.samurai-archives.com/index.php?title=Category:Movies">http://wiki.samurai-archives.com/index.php?title=Category:Movies</a><br/>
There are tons of Samurai and historical movies out there that need to<br/>
be added. Including info such as cast list, synopsis, crew list, etc.<br/>
<br/>
Other sections that also need to be filled out are the Mythology<br/>
sections, including dieties, folklore, and obake:<br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://wiki.samurai-archives.com/index.php?title=Category:Mythology">http://wiki.samurai-archives.com/index.php?title=Category:Mythology</a><br/>
<br/>
The largest categories so far (of course) mostly deal with the sengoku<br/>
period, including:<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1015352096">Hi.<br/>
<br/>
For some reason, I don't appear to be able to edit my own user page  <br/>
anymore. For that matter, I have been busy with the end of the  <br/>
semester, so I may have timed out. Is there a procedure for having my  <br/>
account unlocked?<br/>
<br/>
Thank you very much.</div>

 </span></blockquote>Your account isn't blocked (you have edited your user page in the<br/>
past, so that precluded you from ever being blocked, and I checked the<br/>
block list to be sure) is there a chance you put in the wrong password<br/>
or something like that? I can't figure out what the problem could be<br/>
other than the standard "correct spelling of your user id or password"<br/>
bit. Try again, and let me know if you still can't get in:<br/>
