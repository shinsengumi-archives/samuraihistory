Japanese warriors bring an authentic touch to Armouries' latest <br/>
exhibition<br/>
By Howard Williamson<br/>
SAMURAI warriors brought to life the history behind a major new <br/>
exhibition at the Royal Armouries.<br/>
Until August 30 the arms museum is staging "Shogun: the life of Lord <br/>
Tokugawa Ieyasu," a tribute to the great warrior statesman who <br/>
united Japan 400 years ago.<br/>
And, in order to see the exhibition, a party of Japanese martial <br/>
arts experts and politicians brought forward a planned visit to <br/>
Britain by one year.<br/>
The experts will demonstrate their skills at the Armouries three <br/>
times a day until Wednesday and will then take their show to the <br/>
Tower of London.<br/>
They use a variety of weapons and demonstrate the art of drawing a <br/>
sword and killing an opponent.<br/>
The experts were "guarded" by members of the Ashikita Matchlock Gun <br/>
Society, wearing full samurai armour and carrying muskets.<br/>
They recently competed in a gun festival in Japan where they won the <br/>
top prize.<br/>
The sight of Japanese men and women brandishing guns is in itself a <br/>
rare occurrence for gun control is very strict in that country.<br/>
Graeme Rimer, the Armouries academic director, said: "Holders of <br/>
firearms, even antique ones, are visited every few weeks by police. <br/>
That makes our gun control seem almost lax!"<br/>
Spectators who hoped to see a puff of smoke from the muskets were <br/>
disappointed, however. The visiting party was too late to acquire <br/>
the necessary firearms and blue powder certificates to allow this to <br/>
happen.<br/>
Sacred<br/>
The visitors were entertained at a reception in the Armouries before <br/>
inspecting the exhibition of objects connected to Lord Tokugawa.<br/>
The Mayor of Ashikita, Kazunari Takezaki, said through an <br/>
interpreter: "We do not have this sort of brilliant museum in Japan."<br/>
He is due to meet the Lord Mayor of Leeds at a reception next <br/>
Tuesday.<br/>
Ashikita is a small town of 22,000 people surrounded by mountains <br/>
and is noted for its oranges.<br/>
Graeme Rimer said the musket was introduced to Japan by Portuguese <br/>
traders in 1543 and its importance was recognised by Tokugawa.<br/>
But after he brought peace to his country for 200 years its use fell <br/>
away in favour of traditional weapons.<br/>
The Armouries exhibition is the result of cooperation with its twin, <br/>
the Nikko Toshogu Shrine north of Tokyo.<br/>
It is the first time many of the artefacts have been allowed into <br/>
the west. So precious and sacred are certain works of art that a <br/>
Shinto priest from the shrine is present throughout the exhibition.<br/>
A war fan belonging to a 16th century general has been loaned by the <br/>
Osaka Castle Museum. It has been compared to Nelson's telescope in <br/>
its iconic significance.<br/>
