<h3>Revenge</h3>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-418844324">Hey guys,<br/>
<br/>
You may or may not know I'm a writer, and I'm working on a fantasy <br/>
novel set in a very late Sengoku-era alternate world. I'd like to <br/>
make it as real and accurate as possible, even though it is a fantasy <br/>
world, and some of the questions I have might have instructive <br/>
answers for the list people.<br/>
<br/>
The questions I'd like to start off with are:<br/>
<br/>
1. What were the penalties (if any, social or otherwise) of women <br/>
dressing like men, and men dressing like women, in Japanese culture <br/>
of that time?<br/>
<br/>
2. When did revenge killing become illegal, and what were the <br/>
penalties?<br/>
<br/>
3. What would be the penalties for killing a shogun, and likely <br/>
repercussions politically of a shogun's murder?<br/>
<br/>
4. When did a sword without a tsuba (yes, I'll say it, like Lucy <br/>
Liu's sword in Kill Bill) become acceptable, if it ever did?<br/>
<br/>
I realize these questions might be far more complex than a single <br/>

If you were to a shogun there are two possible outcomes either you would become his replacement or you would be killed in short order by his family or retainers. The political repercussion would be chaos, a power vacume, and possibly cival war as what happened in the case when Oda Nobunaga was murdered. As far as swords without tsuba the only type I know of is an aikuchi a type of mounting for a dagger.<br/>

"realistic"! We'd be GLAD to help, providing you<br/>
provide a small donation to Kitsuno's site with the<br/>
millions you rake in from your book deal! Good luck!<br/>
And keep the questions coming!!<br/>
 <br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>A funny look or two? I'm not sure there were any legal<br/>
penalties, though I wouldn't imagine that the person<br/>
would be well thought of if anyone found out she was a<br/>
woman. <br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> > 2. When did revenge killing become illegal, and what<br/>
> were the <br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Good question--again, I can't provide a definitive<br/>
answer, but I'd say it was probably under the Tokugawa<br/>
shogunate--witness the illegality, yet moral virtue,<br/>
of the 47 Ronin. The penalty in that case was death,<br/>
as it was for most offenses other than the extremely<br/>
trivial. Though if this is late-Sengoku, it depends on<br/>
if there is an authority capable of enforcing the law.<br/>
Would your character be punished by his own lord? It's<br/>
perfectly conceivable that while in the late Sengoku<br/>
there was no Shogun capable of enforcing anything,<br/>
this particular person's daimyo could have a House Law<br/>
against it, or something. <br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> > 3. What would be the penalties for killing a shogun,<br/>
> and likely <br/>
> repercussions politically of a shogun's murder?<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Wow, where to begin...? It would depend on the<br/>
situtation, of course. I can think of 4 instances<br/>
where the Shogun was assasinated/murdered/attacked and<br/>
killed: <br/>
<br/>
Minamoto Yoriie was the second Minamoto Shogun, but<br/>
was deposed and assasinated by his gradfather, Hojo<br/>
Tokimasa, in 1203. Tokimasa put Yoriie's brother<br/>
Sanetomo in the position. Yoriie didn't like being a<br/>
puppet, so he was replaced. Sanetomo was in turn<br/>
assasinated in 1219, by Yoriie's son or an unknown<br/>
assailant, depending on whom you ask. The political<br/>
fallout was that there were no more Minamoto to be<br/>
named Shogun, so the Hojo regents first got two<br/>
Fujiwara, and then imperial princes to hold the<br/>
position, while they continued their actual control of<br/>
the bakufu as Shikken. <br/>
<br/>
Ashikaga Yoshinori was assasinated in 1441, by<br/>
Akamatsu Mitsusuke, a retainer who believed he was<br/>
going to be deprived of his lands. He invited the<br/>
Shogun to a celebration, and had him assasinated<br/>
during the festivities. The bakufu reacted by<br/>
commisioning the Yamana family to destroy the<br/>
Akamatsu, which they did, for the most part. The<br/>
Yamana gained all the Amako lands, and set themselves<br/>
up as a major player in the bakufu, just in time for<br/>
Yamana Sozen to start the Onin War with his moves for<br/>
power (The Shogun, at this point, was once again a<br/>
legitimizing tool for his 'vassal' families to fight<br/>
over, the strongest generally being named Kyoto<br/>
Kanrei). <br/>
<br/>
Ashikaga Yoshiteru was assasinated by Matsunaga<br/>
Hisahide, a retainer of the Miyoshi clan at the time,<br/>
who themselves were former retainers of the Hosokawa,<br/>
the enemies of the Yamana in the Onin War. Yoshiteru,<br/>
while a puppet like most of the others mentioned, did<br/>
resist the Miyoshi, so they removed him by attacking<br/>
his palace in 1565. He held off the attackers<br/>
admirably for a while, then retired to commit seppuku.<br/>
The Miyoshi installed Ashikaga Yoshihide, only to be<br/>
swept aside by Oda Nobunaga 3 years later, with<br/>
Yoshiaki. <br/>
<br/>
All but one of these are instances of a puppet Shogun<br/>
being killed by one faction so they could put their<br/>
puppet, or at least a puppet more cooperative, in<br/>
place. If you're looking at the Shogun being a strong<br/>
figure, someone who might deserve to die in a revenge<br/>
killing, these examples might not help. If the Shogun<br/>
ruled rather than reigned, there would be a power<br/>
vacuum while a successor was named, etc. If the<br/>
successor was young, a regent would be named, who<br/>
would probably be the strongest retainer. Conflict<br/>
would no doubt take place with other retainers who<br/>
were jealous...and you see the cycle.<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Never. Swords in shirasaya, the scabbard with no tsuba<br/>
(usually light wood colored) are kept that way for<br/>
storage. For someone to carry it and use it, they'd<br/>
take it and mount it in a normal mounting. Shirasaya<br/>
protect the blade while it's being stored or shipped. <br/>

copies!<br/>

 my name is carl.ive been studying budo taijutsu fer a long time.its really cool to here that someone wants to write a book thats somewhat realistic & accurate.as far as answers fer some of yer questions.women dressing like men,i dont believe there really was a penalty fer that.i know if u dressed like a mna that most men wouldnt really know the difference until u presented yerself as a woman dressed like a man.revenge killing has always technically been illegal,just nobody cared.i believe that they started enforcing the penaltys fer revenge killing when they started doing awya w/the samurai.thats aslo the time that alot of samurai or bugei who did revenge killing started instituting the "living to the bitter end".penalties fer killing the shogun has always resulted in death.if u got caught killing them& they didnt kill u then,they were gonna put u in a trial then execute u.the reprecussions could amount to just about anything.it all depended on the structural integrity of the social<br/>
 system.it could amount to complete & total chaos,or it would amount to a power struggle....sometimes it was done by means of tyrannicide.as for the sword used in kill bill.that type of sword wouldve been called a zatoichi.it was never acceptable by anybody except fer people who still practiced budo taijutsu.supposedly ronin,ninja,& the ilk carried them.but it was never acceptable.usually it was used to romanticize the image of budo.if u have any questions,feel free to ask me ,hopefully i can be of help.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Izumo no Okuni (a woman)became famous for doing just that, at the very <br/>
end of the Azuchi-momoyama period. Dressed as a man sporting a <br/>
crucifix, and a pair of gaudy swords, she was a huge hit. She founded a <br/>
very famous theatre tradition. I suggest that you do a search for her, <br/>
I am sure you will get lots of wonderful info as well as the answer you <br/>
seek.<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> ><br/>

 </span></blockquote>	Not sure it was outlawed but was highly "legislated" in the Tokugawa <br/>
period. Under the right circumstances you could be rewarded for it. The <br/>
Ako-roshi are an excellent example, they did everything right but <br/>
because at the very heart of their action was rebellion against the <br/>
Bakufu they were sentenced to death.<br/>
	See "Tales of Samurai Honour" (by Callaghan I think it is) for some <br/>
interesting background and stories dealing with Adauchi.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>(Never say never) One of the most gifted and interesting of the Sengoku <br/>
Daimyo was Uesugi Kenshin. He is known to have cherished the work of <br/>
Bizen smiths and the great swordsmith Nagamitsu especially, he had <br/>
several bona-fide blades. All mounted as tachi, all mounted WITHOUT <br/>
tsuba. This style is not called aikuchi-koshirae which is used for <br/>
tanto but rather Uesugi-koshirae. It was unusual but not unheard of. I <br/>
think one finds it easier to draw and return a sword of greater length <br/>
without the tsuba and some have pointed to his example as evidence that <br/>
a tsuba is a "hand stop and not a hand guard..."<br/>
-t<br/>
<br/>
I have also heard it said that many soldiers removed their guards <br/>
before going into battle.</div>

Hi <br/>
<br/>
Zatoichi is person in a movie, not a type of sword<br/>
<br/>
the sword that people are trying to call zatoichi is<br/>
actually called a shikomi zue. <br/>
<br/>
If you are studying Budo Taijutsu May I suggest you<br/>
watcht he Kukishinden Hanbjutsu Shikomi Zue video,<br/>
then you may see one in use.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Another poster also mentioned the Uesugi sword. <br/>
<br/>
Aikuchi tanto notwithstanding (being tanto and not<br/>
katana, and therefore more of a knife rather than a<br/>
sword, in which case the tsuba isn't nearly as<br/>
functional), I'll change my statement from "Never" to<br/>
"it was so extremely rare that the wealth of knowledge<br/>
on this board has been able to come up with ONE<br/>
example." <br/>
<br/>
The point is not "was there ever even ONE example of<br/>
this sword", it is to inform the prospective author<br/>
that it's not bloody likely someone would be walking<br/>
around with a sword with no tsuba in the late Sengoku.<br/>
Should she wish to still include it in her story,<br/>
well, it's her story--more power to her. But the<br/>
answer to her question is no, people didn't use these,<br/>
generally speaking, ever. One example doesn't disprove<br/>
that statement. <br/>

Hi <br/>
<br/>
Zatoichi is person in a movie, not a type of sword<br/>
<br/>
the sword that people are trying to call zatoichi is<br/>
actually called a shikomi zue. <br/>
<br/>
If you are studying Budo Taijutsu May I suggest you<br/>
watcht he Kukishinden Hanbjutsu Shikomi Zue video,<br/>
then you may see one in use.<br/>
