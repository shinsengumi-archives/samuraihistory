<h3>Personal Combat at 4th Kawanakajima, Koyo Gunkan&#39;s take</h3>
by <i>iganokami</i>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1553510011">I just picked up the Koyo Gunkan - I don't know if it is the 'short' <br/>
version or what (I've heard in the past the Koyo Gunkan was three or <br/>
four volumes - this is a single volume), but anyway, I was flipping <br/>
through it, and I found the passage that mentions the famed personal <br/>
combat between Shingen and Kenshin at 4th Kawanakajima that I've seen <br/>
mentioned on this group.  It tells about the attack, how the rider <br/>
was driven off by Hara Osumi, etc.  But NOWHERE in that passage does <br/>
it mention that the rider was Kenshin!  After the passage, there is a <br/>
single line-- It says something to the effect of 'later, it was said <br/>
this was Terutora' (my reading of Kobun is not very advanced, but <br/>
it's a short sentence that looks something like 'Ato Kikeba' the <br/>
warrior terutora (followed by the Kanji for 'mousu' combined with the <br/>
kanji for kou/sourou (10 strokes, ninben).  So it looks to me like <br/>
the Koyo Gunkan doesn't even really claim it was Kenshin at all, only <br/>
that later it was said it was.  I guess some playwrite for some Noh <br/>
drama about 4th Kawanakajima in the 18th century must have decided it <br/>
would be nice and epic if he had kenshin and shingen fight it out <br/>
onstage, and that is how it got started that shingen and <br/>
kenshin 'definately fought' at that battle....? anyone have any <br/>
insight?  I know someone mentioned another source that said it was <br/>
thier Kagemusha fighting each other....</div>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-90706834">Hi,<br/>
Terutora is the name of Kenshin at that time.Given one letter from <br/>
the name of Yoshiteru,Ashikaga Shogun,he changed his name.<br/>
So,the author of Koyo gunkan says he heard the rider was Kenshin.<br/>
<br/>
It might have been just a rumor though.,,<br/>

<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1044298251">Exactly. I found it very strange that even though Kenshin is not <br/>
mentioned at all anywhere in the body of the text but just a line <br/>
added afterwards saying "later, it was thought it was Terutora <br/>
(Kenshin)" it has become almost common knowledge that kenshin and <br/>
shingen fought each other during the battle.  It looks to me like the <br/>
writer just heard a rumor and threw it in for the heck of it.  I <br/>
think if it was verifiably kenshin, it would have mentioned it in the <br/>
actual body of the text.  Do any other sources put Kenshin as the <br/>
attacker, or just the Koyo Gunkan?<br/>
