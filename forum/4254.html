<div id="ygrps-yiv-1071933869">As OT posts tend to only occasionally pop up in this group compared to most <br/>
others, I do tend to be fairly lenient as long as the topic has at least a general <br/>
relation to Japan, but I'll bring attention (yet again) to the fact that there are <br/>
a few other groups that I moderate which fit the category of "Off-Topic Japan-<br/>
Related posts", so I'll encourage anyone interested to visit them all:<br/>
<br/>
Japan-O-Rama: <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://groups.yahoo.com/group/japantoday/">http://groups.yahoo.com/group/japantoday/</a><br/>
This is the epitome of the OT discussion - ANYTHING even vaguely related to Japan <br/>
is encouraged, doesn't matter one bit what it is if you can find some vague and <br/>
tenuous relation to Japan.<br/>
<br/>
Japanese Entertainment: <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://forums.delphiforums.com/jtainment/start">http://forums.delphiforums.com/jtainment/start</a><br/>
A forum for anything and everything related to Japanese entertainment, movies, <br/>
anime, etc.<br/>
<br/>
Modern Japan: <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://forums.delphiforums.com/mjapan/start">http://forums.delphiforums.com/mjapan/start</a><br/>
A forum for anything Japan related from the 20th century onward.<br/>
<br/>
Foreign Policy and International Affairs: <br/>
