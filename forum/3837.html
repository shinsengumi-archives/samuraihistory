<div id="ygrps-yiv-1744425369">yes i have read the Hagakure "behind the leaves" and to me it is a good view of the way this samurai thought. He has his his strict way to live and criticises a lot in the way men think of the today (in his time of cause) while he lives like a samurai.<br/>
Short passages of his way gives ous a good look of something we cant completly make ourself of because to understand we have to live like him.<br/>
hope thats something helps you to your question. More i can tell you about, if i know more precisely what you want to know about!<br/>
