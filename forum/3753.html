<h3>Samurai History Game</h3>
by <i>kevinburns_jp</i>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1409174729">What is your favourite game about Samurai history?<br/>
<br/>
I live in Kanagawa, Japan and have done for many years. I like it <br/>
here.<br/>
<br/>
So far my favourite is Shogun or Samurai Swords by Milton Bradley. <br/>
But I haven`t played so many yet. I have also played a Japanese<br/>
game called Sekigahara by 6 Angles. Another game by 6 Angles<br/>
depicted the Mongol invasion of Japan--the one where the "Kamikaze"<br/>
or Divine Wind intervened. Another good simulation--it game one the<br/>
feeling of being there, as much as a game can.<br/>
<br/>
Your thoughts on games please.<br/>
<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-526621294">Shogun is a decent game--the second time they released<br/>
it they called it "Samurai Swords", for whatever<br/>
reason. It's the best board game about Japan I've<br/>
seen...not familiar with too many others. <br/>
<br/>
I'm a big fan of Shogun:Total War and it's follow-ups,<br/>
though they aren't the greatest accuracy wise, they<br/>
make up for it in game play. And of course if you have<br/>
access to Japanese games, the Nobunaga's Ambition<br/>
(Nobunaga no Yabou) series is still going strong (just<br/>
bought a new one a week or so ago!)<br/>

       Have you played the Onimusha series yet?  If so, what's your opinion?  <br/>
Personally, I've played and beaten -- and loved -- 1 & 2 and am looking <br/>
forward to 8 May, when the final installment comes out.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-777806658">I love Shogun Total War. But I have to agree on the<br/>
accuracy of the game. I would love to play the<br/>
campaigns of Shimazu Yoshihisa and conquer Kyushu.<br/>
Then face the armies of Toyotomi Hideyoshi on my<br/>
terms. I don't like the map set up and what clans have<br/>
what province or that there are only 7 or 8 factions.<br/>
So my friends and I play the custom battles on line.<br/>
So we have one on one samurai battles between us.<br/>
<br/>
Question to Nate. Is Nobunaga's Ambition available for<br/>
computer gamers. I remember it for the old Nentendo<br/>
system. It was one of my favorite(Takeda Shingen!!!).<br/>

stateside--try Amazon maybe. If it's not there, and<br/>
you're interested, and your computer reads Japanese<br/>
fonts, email me off list and we can work something<br/>
out. <br/>

The Japanese versions are released yearly.<br/>
