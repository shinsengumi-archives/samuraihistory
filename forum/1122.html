<h3>A shogun total war question</h3>
by <i>samurai182uk</i>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-574257615">Hi all<br/>
<br/>
I have a question about total war, it is a bit off topic, but is <br/>
related to samurai of course. I wondered if anyone knows the <br/>
difference between the Japanese and European versions, besides the <br/>
language. I have found this website. It is excellent <br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://shogun23.hypermart.net/index2.htm">http://shogun23.hypermart.net/index2.htm</a> please click on the 2nd <br/>
kanji from left then find the units and building pages, is it me or <br/>
are the units different. There is a unit called the father visitor, <br/>
bizarre. I wonder if It realtes to a Jesuit father? historically <br/>
accurate. Plus there are 5 types of castles etc. I am confused <br/>
greatly. If anyone knows can you message back. I wanted to post this <br/>
question on the totalwar.org board but I cant get it work, also if <br/>
anyone knows about this? Last thing I will say I really enjoy total <br/>
war it is an excellent game, it has I am sure done a great service to <br/>
Japanese history interest. It is reasonably historically accurate, <br/>
Stephen Turnbull helped on it, it is one thing I would compliment him <br/>
for. Now the Medieval version is out on the 30th in the UK I can't <br/>
wait. But even though it supposedly rocks, I would have preferred <br/>
more on the sengoku Jidai, perhaps, all throughout Japans history. We <br/>
should not forget shogun, now it's European cousin is around, Me for <br/>
one will be loyal, well until the 30th anyroad! ohh well I can dream, <br/>
it will happen one day we all know. Ok then, my next post will be <br/>
more historical, perhaps, possibly on Japanese mercaneries in India? <br/>
hmmmm, <br/>
<br/>
All the best then Mark</div>

<h3>Re: [samuraihistory] Shinsengumi</h3>

<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-928237180">Hi Cherry..<br/>
 The Shinsengumi were one of several groups set up in Japan at the end of the <br/>
Edo period (Around the late 1860's) in an attempt to stabilise the <br/>
governments hold over both the general populace and the Daimyo who saw the <br/>
weakness' in the control the Tokugawa Shogunate had over things at the <br/>
time...Weakness that was added to by the foreigners appearance and demands <br/>
upon Japan and the Shogunates handling of several political dilemmas during <br/>
the period....These groups were essentially little more than political armed <br/>
police...Many had a political agenda and were used to reinforce ideas in <br/>
government. The power gained by these groups was immense and the Shinsengumi <br/>
were a major group working with the aims of keeping the Samurai in power <br/>
rather than restoring the emperors power to rule Japan.<br/>
 A good book to start you off with a bit more info would be 'Samurai <br/>
sketches' by Romulus Hillsborough...A collection of 'tidbits' from around <br/>
that time and a good filler for a general idea of the whole situation then..<br/>

 </span></blockquote>It's not the best movie on the Shinsengumi, despite featuring Toshiro <br/>
Mifune as Kondo Isami. Not much historical accuracy either, though I <br/>
haven't seen any movie on the Shinsengumi that is historically <br/>
accurate so far. But for those who have never watched any movie <br/>
featuring Shinsengumi (except Gohatto), then I guess it may be <br/>
something enjoyable.<br/>

<h3>Shinsengumi</h3>
by <i>ltdomer98</i>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1729864056">All--<br/>
<br/>
Okay, I'm finally here in Japan, just settled on a 4<br/>
bedroom house in Yoyogi (God I love what the<br/>
government does for me!) and celebrated last night by<br/>
watching Karakuri Terebi and the first installment of<br/>
the Shinsengumi Taiga Drama last night. I liked it,<br/>
but unlike when I watch Hideyoshi or Nobunaga or Aoi<br/>
Sandai, for example, I'm not all that familiar with<br/>
the story. Any recommendations (in English, if<br/>
possible...I've got my fill translating military<br/>
documents for the moment) of books to check out that<br/>
can give me a roadmap here? I'm vaguely familiar with<br/>
Sakamoto Ryoma from history class, but was a little<br/>
confused with Kondo Isami and the guy he was chasing<br/>
in the beginning of the show, but apparently was<br/>
friends with 10 years before (when they flashed<br/>
back--William Letham, I know you watched it last<br/>
night, help with his name??). <br/>
<br/>
Thanks for the assitance--I was surprised a little<br/>
with Katori Shingo's performance (good, so far) and of<br/>
course as it has Sawaguchi Yasuko in it, I'm happy.<br/>
Another question for William--is the woman playing<br/>
Kondo Isami's mother the same woman who was<br/>
Mitsuhide's mother in "Hideyoshi"?? Sokkuri but I<br/>
couldn't catch the name. <br/>
<br/>
Speaking of Hideyoshi, Kitsuno, I see you've got<br/>
Ishikawa Goemon as the Samurai of the Month on the<br/>
website--I just watched the episode where he gets<br/>
boiled in oil...a little different than the<br/>
description you've got, eh?<br/>
<br/>
Thanks all!<br/>

Mata!<br/>

For books on the era try<br/>
Beasley The Meiji Restoration<br/>
Totman The Collapse of the Tokugawa Bakufu<br/>
Jansen Sakamoto Ryoma and the Meiji Restoration<br/>
Thomas Huber The Revolutionary Origins of Modern Japan<br/>
<br/>
In addition you might try two of Romulos Hillsborough's books, Ryoma,<br/>
Samurai Sketches. They are not particularly well written by they have a lot<br/>
of good info.<br/>
<br/>
You might also try one of the series guides that are in the bookstores.<br/>
Particularly the official NHK one (with Kondo Isami/Shigo-kun on the cover)<br/>
They have pix of all the stars and the characters they play. Thankfully this<br/>
one is done in hiragana, better to read.<br/>

Yes that's right. Her name is Nogiwa Yoko<br/>

By the way do you have access to cable or skyperfect yet. The first episode<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1820320126">Konnichi Wa Hazu-Did you know that Ishikawa Goemon is also the name of a <br/>
member of Lupin III's hazu (gang). The others are Fujiko Mine and Daisuke <br/>
Jigen. Lupin III is the grandson of the infamous Arsene Lupin the suave and <br/>
sophisticated art thief from 1920's France. The most famous duo to play<br/>
the roles of Lupin and his nemesis on the Surete in Paris were the <br/>
Barrymores. The father (Lionel) played the Surete inspector whose name I <br/>
don't recall (in Lupin III anime he is named Zenigato and is a bumbling <br/>
idiot a la Peter Sellers' Inspector Clouseau character in the "pink Panther" <br/>
films) while the son (John) played Lupin himself to perfection. Goemon's <br/>
voice is Lex Lang who also voices Sagara Sanosuke on Rurouni Kenshin. In <br/>
Lupin Goemon is a "jiti lito"(spelling) master and uses a<br/>
katana with amazing speed and accuracy. He can also predict Lupin's fate by <br/>
the "shadow" on the<br/>
blade. Cool! We never knew that there was a REAL Goemon in Japanese history. <br/>
Wonder if Jigen and Fujicakes have similar correlations? There WAS a real <br/>
art thief/swindler named Arsene Lupin in France but he was earlier than the <br/>
1920's. We believe that David Niven's "Raffles" character was based on <br/>
Lupin. BTW, Lupin III is on Sunday(early Monday) through Thursday(early <br/>
Friday) evenings at 1:30 AM EDT/EST (1 AM on Sundays) on the Cartoon <br/>
Network. Channel 58 on Comcast here in<br/>
Brookhaven PA-USA. Check it out if ya want-we'll answer any questions you <br/>
have too. Ja Mata from Keiman and Kei.<br/>

won't move in for another week or so, but that's<br/>
negotiated into my lease. I've got the first episode<br/>
of Nobunaga, King of Zipangu on tape, watched part of<br/>
it last night--the rest I'l have to catch once I'm in<br/>
the house...<br/>
<br/>
so does the jidai geki channel come with Sky Perfect,<br/>

<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-2054466218">So does it look like the Shinsengumi drama will be worth watching?  <br/>
It will probably start coming into the Japanese vid store here in a <br/>
few weeks, but I don't know, I had no interest in Musashi, and I <br/>
couldn't bear 'Toshie to Matsu' and didn't get beyond the first <br/>
episode, so I don't know...  I haven't really liked a Taiga drama <br/>
since Tokugawa Yoshinobu.  But much like William and 'The Last <br/>
Samurai', I had to listen to my wife talk about how Kokkoii "Mok-kun" <br/>
was the whole time. Motoki Masahiro usually comes across as too <br/>
effeminate in a lot of his other shows and movies (like, say, as the <br/>
gay nightclub partyboy in 'Gonin', for example), but I thought he was <br/>
real good in Tokugawa Yoshinobu.<br/>

and he plays well the role of the kakko-ii chap. Let's face it: he's <br/>

I guess you hadn't heard that Kusanagi Tsuyoshi of SMAP played Toyotomi<br/>
Hideyoshi in another jidai geki this past Shogastu. This makes Nakai<br/>
Masahiro the only member not to play jidai geki.<br/>
<br/>
Personally I like the fact that they are getting younger people to play<br/>
these parts. Its strains credulity to watch ojisans like Kitaoji Kinya and<br/>
Mastukata Hiroki play these roles.<br/>
<br/>
As per your other question whether Shinsengumi is worth watching. Well the<br/>
first episode was alright. Kinda of hard to believe Kondo, Hijikata, Ryoma,<br/>
Kastura, and Sakuma Shozan going on road trip to see Kurofune. Nevertheless<br/>
I will sit through anything with chonmage (The jidai collection is pass the<br/>

Can't find the phone number at the moment but I do have it somewhere if you can't get hold of it. It also holds lots of translations of Japanese literature. I read (among other things) "Before the Dawn" there which is a fascinating novel by Shimazaki Toson giving lots of interesting background on the Meiji era.<br/>

Don't use anything you see in a Rurouni Kenshin cartoon, as entertaining as it might be. Although there is some historical background, it isn't something you should be using for factual information. A better film would be Gohatto (Taboo is the English-release title) which is available at most larger video store chains. <br/>
