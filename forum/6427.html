<h3>Swords and spirits:  a few new thoughts, and a little theology</h3>
by <i>geregjonesmuller</i>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-256435065">Well, I recently got myself a pu-dao (a Chinese naginata, approximately -<br/>
maybe a nagamaki).  This is a mass-produced piece, although it's nicely<br/>
balanced and (at the risk of provoking a duel) it does cut well.  After the<br/>
discussion that's gone one here on the subject of spirits perceived in<br/>
blades (or not), I was paying especial attention to any feelings I got from<br/>
the blade.<br/>
	In fact, I perceived very little.  More like a spark ready to be fanned<br/>
into flame than anything that felt like a genuine 'presence'.  (We picked up<br/>
a new kitten the same day:  now there [by way of contrast] is a thoroughly<br/>
genuine little presence.)  The pu-dao feels very much the way a<br/>
decently-made new weapon usually feels, only hitherto I haven't been<br/>
analyzing the sensations so narrowly.  The exceptions to this tendency, in<br/>
my experience, have been hand-forged blades, of which several have seemed to<br/>
me already to be 'present.'<br/>
	Now I have to verge into theology here, and observe that I don't believe<br/>
humans have the power to create the kind of presence that I perceive in<br/>
these weapons - those weapons, new or well-used, that carry a sense of<br/>
character about them.  But I do believe that everything in the universe<br/>
carries a certain amount of inherent spirit in it, which is not unreasonable<br/>
if one regards everything as the product of an ultimate spirit. (If that<br/>
term is vague, it's also as neutral as I can make it.)  This is a belief<br/>
that is not out of tune with my understanding of the development of Shinto,<br/>
a collection of beliefs that bears a considerable resemblance to European<br/>
and Amerindian nature religions.  The very term 'Shinto' is loosely<br/>
translated as Way of the Spirits:  a reading of the characters for michi<br/>
(Way) and kami (which can mean everything from humans, to what the classical<br/>
Greeks would have regarded as dryads and naiads, to mountains, gods, and<br/>
fundamental universal principles).   (While humans are not properly<br/>
described as kami, technically we do qualify, along with anything possessing<br/>
a spirit.  To the followers of Shinto, and within my faith as well, this<br/>
includes quite a few things that modern culture regards as inanimate.<br/>
	So my current thinking on this subject is that the kind of focus, will and<br/>
labour involved in hand-crafting a thing, or the loving use of a thing, can<br/>
awaken the spirit inherent in it, and (in some manner that I don't begin to<br/>
comprehend) can augment its development of 'presence,' or individual<br/>
character.  I do not expect to persuade anyone to adopt this view, but for<br/>
those who have experienced something similar, it may provide some fresh<br/>
insight.  And for those interested in the beliefs of the samurai, it may<br/>
offer some insight into just how those beliefs might have developed in the<br/>
first place.  For - as I've said before - I've never known a serious sworder<br/>
who did not share my sense of a good sword carrying a spirit that eludes<br/>
either easy description or easy dismissal.  It's simply easier to fit the<br/>
idea into some views of reality than others.<br/>

G:  You know, if the two of you are both taking my posting this way, it's<br/>
apparent I wasn't clear enough.  My apologies.  Because after all, those<br/>
'guys with the helmets and swords' had religious beliefs, beliefs that<br/>
affected the way they regarded those swords (and a great deal of the rest of<br/>
their world as well).  That does seem, to my poor brain at least, to be<br/>
relevant to the subject of samurai history.  The dryads and naiads were<br/>
intended as parallels in western culture, and I hoped that by using such<br/>
examples in discussing Shinto with a primarily western audience, I could<br/>
make clearer the great variety of beings that in Shinto are considered to<br/>
have spirits.<br/>
Kitsuno, I did not in fact cite gnomes and elves; but I believe I could<br/>
legitimately have done so in the context of Shinto, and still have been on<br/>
the subject.  To be honest, I don't know what the Shinto view on, say, the<br/>
Tengu really is.  Are they technically considered kami?  I'm honestly most<br/>
curious to learn that.<br/>
Perhaps I should have expanded on the whole subject for greater clarity, but<br/>
I rather thought that brevity would be more welcome than detail.<br/>
	As to the subject as a whole... gentlemen, I find it hard to believe that<br/>
in a forum for the discussion of samurai history, you both regard it as<br/>
inappropriate to address their beliefs.  ...At least their religious<br/>
beliefs:  bushido (and its modern offshoots and parallels) are appropriate<br/>
but Shinto (and its) are not?<br/>
This is what makes me think that I was somehow unclear.  My own beliefs I<br/>
brought up primarily because of the 'land mine' I inadvertently set by<br/>
having failed to note them in the earlier rounds of this discussion:  but<br/>
perhaps the mention of them in this round caused some confusion in turn.<br/>
(Catch-22, anyone?)  I suggest to you that I have not actually strayed from<br/>
the subject of the list by pursuing this thread.  I was, and am still,<br/>
trying to increase understanding - my own and others' - of a traditional<br/>
aspect of Japanese culture, and specifically of the subculture of the bushi.<br/>
I thought that's what we were here for.  Kinda weird, kinda wild, as you<br/>
say.  But there it is.<br/>

statement would be hilariously funny. It was a great<br/>
time--nothing beats a nice hot onsen after tramping<br/>
around the mountains all day. No castles this time,<br/>
but I did go to the Hakone Tokaido Sekisho--cool<br/>
stuff. The first day we couldn't see Fuji at all, the<br/>
second day we could see the top, the clouds obscured<br/>
the bottom, and the third day we could see the bottom,<br/>
but clouds were at the top. So between the days, we<br/>
might have a decent picture. I'll send you the link<br/>
once I get around to posting them. <br/>

Well, as an absolute neophyte on this list I have been following this thread<br/>
with more than a little interest.  We see the celluloid samurai in various<br/>
guises - chambara, TC, and "The Twilight Samurai" as a more 'serious'<br/>
flick - but I have often wondered about what we might describe as "the<br/>
cognitive map" of a samurai's world-view.  I read that their education was<br/>
limited to their rank in the Class and that the bottom of the samurai class<br/>
were subsistence farmers.  Were they really ALL prepared to face death in an<br/>
instant?  Anyway, however uninformed my own position, I certainly support<br/>
this thread as being relevant to samurai history.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Yeah. There's something really... I think surreal might be the word... about <br/>
onsens in winter. Especially if you luck out with a rotenburo and get to soak in <br/>
the warm water watching steam rising off it.<br/>
<br/>
Damn, I miss that sort of thing. >whimper<<br/>

is<br/>
modern metaphysical claptrap.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Tony<br/>
<br/>
G:  This is the worst-aimed thrust I've ever seen out of you, Tony, so I<br/>
almost have to assume that certain prejudices (prejudices which crop up<br/>
fairly routinely, alas, among many members of your mystery cult) have dimmed<br/>
the usual clarity of your thinking.  The principles of Shinto, even in the<br/>
speculative form discussed by me on this forum, are scarcely modern.  Now as<br/>
it happens (though it may come as something of a surprise to you), I never<br/>
wanted to see this list become a comparative theology forum, and (though it<br/>
may come as another surprise) I am as heartily tired of this subject as you<br/>
appear to be.<br/>
           But insulting somebody's faith isn't the way to put an end to<br/>
such a discussion.  Consider how you'd react if I described your church as<br/>
modern metaphysical claptrap:  Eastern Orthodox, I believe you said (and you<br/>
brought it up in a context far more distantly related to the list's topic, I<br/>
might add, than was mine when I brought it up).  Now I could certainly make<br/>
a case for any Christian sect falling into the category of modern<br/>
metaphysics, while as to claptrap... well, only if I chose to be so rude.<br/>
Because after all, one man's metaphysics is another man's theology:  and<br/>
which one is which, of course, is entirely a matter of belief and<br/>
perspective.<br/>
          Please recall that I only entered this discussion, Tony, when<br/>
someone ridiculed a principle of my beliefs, to wit the old idea that swords<br/>
may have spirits.  So in the process of discussing that point, some<br/>
explication of those beliefs became necessary (as it seemed to me) in order<br/>
for my points to be clearer... and also to promote the sort of dialogue that<br/>
can take place among folks who're capable of civil disagreement on matters<br/>
of faith.  I think this intellectual community should be capable of that<br/>
courtesy.  This is particularly important, as I see it, given the<br/>
theological diversity that can be seen across the span of samurai history.<br/>
(You should be more aware of that than I.)  It seems to me it would promote<br/>
healthier dialogues if, for example, the role of Christianity among the<br/>
samurai (a subject of some interest to me, in fact) could be brought up<br/>
without Christians on the list feeling that their faith is going to be<br/>
subjected to insults by those who hold with other, in some cases older,<br/>
religions.<br/>
          Because ideas relating to Shinto traditions, and even the idea of<br/>
comparing these traditions to other world religious traditions, or for that<br/>
matter to personal experiences, is only modern metaphysical claptrap if the<br/>
original traditions are metaphysical claptrap. And of course, that can be<br/>
said about any man's religion.<br/>
          Tony, I think you are capable of criticising my views more<br/>
rationally, more politely, and more effectively than this.  And if what you<br/>
really want is an end to this subject, you can be certain you'll achieve<br/>
that goal more effectively through courtesy or silence than through a petty,<br/>
ill-calculated insult like this one.  I deeply resent needing to defend my<br/>
beliefs - whatever you may think of them - against such an insult:<br/>
especially in what is supposed to be civilised company, and most especially<br/>
from the most rarified intellectual stratum of the group.  It's unworthy of<br/>
you.  If you can offer some kind of rational support for your disagreements,<br/>
and can manage to be polite about it, that's another matter.  Then we can<br/>
discuss theology (off-list, for the gods' sake!) as long as you please.  But<br/>
you've crossed a boundary here that no one on the list should have to take.<br/>
          In honour,<br/>
                  Gereg</div>
