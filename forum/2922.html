<div id="ygrps-yiv-395626803">A word of explanation.  My study of armor in Japan begins in the Muromachi <br/>
Period, so I am relatively unaware of details of armor in preceding eras. As to <br/>
why arm protection was phased out,  as Japan arguably entered its most violent <br/>
era,  is a question whose answer would be difficult indeed.  My SO is  a whiz <br/>
on Japan,  I believe she lived there, so I might ask her sometime.  As <br/>
always,  great pleasure in talking to you,  Tom.  Jack<br/>
