Many history books are intended to push a particular agenda. I suppose <br/>
that<br/>
one can say that the writer of a book that is labeled "history" usually<br/>
believes that their main point and their main agenda are both correct.<br/>
---<br/>
That is a point that I am willing to concede even though I disagree <br/>
with it somewhat.  But even granting it's validity, regardless of the <br/>
baggage with which a historian comes to a particular subject, they <br/>
still must support any conclusions that they make.  That is, for <br/>
anything that is not undisputed and requires that the historian 'fill <br/>
in the gaps', they must present the evidence that brought them to <br/>
whatever conclusion they have reached.  It is then up to the reader to <br/>
judge whether the writer has been successful at their task of <br/>
convincing the audience based upon the available evidence.<br/>
<br/>
Nina wrote:<br/>
How many times have you read history books that, for instance, state <br/>
that<br/>
"the following IS the story of the 47 Ako ronin's revenge" and then <br/>
read a<br/>
description that is full of suppositions, assumptions, unfounded facts.<br/>
---<br/>
Not in many many years.<br/>
<br/>
Nina wrote:<br/>
Mainly because all of the details simply are not available. I don't <br/>
know how<br/>
many contrasting and conflicting "historical" accounts of the revenge <br/>
of the<br/>
47 ronin that I've read in who knows how many history books. Like <br/>
fiction<br/>
writers, historical writers will "fill in the gaps" with suppositions <br/>
when<br/>
the actual empirical evidence doesn't exist. So to say outright that <br/>
each<br/>
and every history book is "to try and be correct" misses the point <br/>
because<br/>
that is not the case with all of them.<br/>
---<br/>
It has, in fact, been the case with every book on Japanese history that <br/>
I have read in the last 8 years or so.  Mainly because I stick to <br/>
writings by professional historians whose careers are built/destroyed <br/>
on the rigor that they apply to their subjects.  One book (or article <br/>
for that matter) full of speculation and unfounded claims would in <br/>
short order end their careers as historians.<br/>
<br/>
Nina wrote:<br/>
There really isn't any problem with historical writers doing some <br/>
"filling<br/>
in" with suppositions and assumptions when actual sources aren't <br/>
available.<br/>
If a writer is actually trying to write a correct account, then he/she <br/>
will<br/>
tell us that the account that has been written is speculative. What is<br/>
probably the best way to tell us about a certain event is to present <br/>
several<br/>
versions that could be deducted from what empirical facts are available <br/>
and<br/>
then discuss which version makes the most sense to the writer.<br/>
---<br/>
Indeed.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Nina wrote:<br/>
But in my experience, most history writers don't do this. Instead, they<br/>
present a single version of an event as THE FACTS. And thus there are <br/>
about<br/>
50 or so "factual" versions (at least) in several "history" books of <br/>
how the<br/>
dispute between Lord Asano and Lord Kira took place, what caused Lord <br/>
Asano<br/>
to draw his sword, what happened afterward, how the 47 Ako retainers who<br/>
planned an attack on Kira actually accomplished this, what happened <br/>
after<br/>
the attack, etc.<br/>
---<br/>
I am not sure if I mentioned it in my last post, but what you say here <br/>
is one of the difficulties that I see in narrative histories.  It is <br/>
incredibly difficult from extant textual sources to give an account of <br/>
any event -- complex or otherwise -- that reads like a novel or other <br/>
type of fiction.  That kind of detail either doesn't make it into <br/>
documents (official documents and contracts), or is, as you have <br/>
pointed out, unreliable (diaries, parodies).  So, while I am interested <br/>
in the incident of the 47 ronin and the fascination that it holds as a <br/>
bit of cultural legacy, I wouldn't expect an historical account to be <br/>
able to provide me with he-said/she-said kind of details.  Who said <br/>
what to whom and how 47 guys planned a 'secret' attack, nearly 4 <br/>
centuries ago is (and should be) beyond the powers of historiography.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Nina wrote:<br/>
One of the other posters mentioned "peer review" as if somehow that <br/>
makes<br/>
the historical work certified in some way as "accurate" and therefore <br/>
not to<br/>
be questioned. Peers can be just as human, have just as many agendas of<br/>
their own to push as the author does. Even those peers with tons of <br/>
letters<br/>
and degrees behind their name can have agendas.<br/>
---<br/>
I mentioned it.  And while peer review does not guarantee that the <br/>
writer's conclusions are accurate, it does guarantee a couple of <br/>
things.  First, it makes sure that other experts in the field have <br/>
examined and criticized the work.  It is precisely because these <br/>
reviewers 'can be just as human, have just as many agendas of their own <br/>
to push as the author does' that their review is valuable.  While they <br/>
all have presumably read the relevant sources (both primary and <br/>
secondary), they all have made their own conclusions and therefore can <br/>
have the opportunity to engage the writing and point out areas that <br/>
lack adequate support, are unfounded, etc.  Second, peer review allows <br/>
the reader to assume a certain amount of fact-checking has occurred.  <br/>
So, when an author states that on a certain page of a certain source a <br/>
certain claim is made, the reader can be confident that if they too go <br/>
to the source, they will find what they are looking for.<br/>
<br/>
Not quite sure why the 'letters and degrees behind their name' idea <br/>
seems to pop up so much.  While I doctorate in history (or related <br/>
field) does not make one perfect, I think we can agree that there is <br/>
worthwhile training that occurs in postgraduate programs.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Nina wrote:<br/>
I hate to say it, but history isn't like computer programming or <br/>
mathematics<br/>
(my fields of expertise) with clear-cut divisions between "true" and<br/>
"false." So we're going to have several different versions of "the <br/>
facts"<br/>
and we're going to have to learn to use our own heads to read several<br/>
sources and decide for ourselves. We will each come up with different<br/>
conclusions and therefore, we can have lists like this one to exchange<br/>
ideas.<br/>
---<br/>
Not so.  We can say with accuracy on which day of which month of which <br/>
year, some became shogun.  We can say with certainty that a certain <br/>
Hosokawa What'shisname commanded troops during the Onin War, and it <br/>
would be false to say that someone else did.  But there are some things <br/>
that the historical endeavor can not say definitively.  But I contend <br/>
that that is true in subjects like computer science as well.  Can you <br/>
say that a hash sort is better than a recursive quick sort?  I believe <br/>
the answer is that it depends on the amount of data to be stored, how <br/>
one determines the hash key, etc.  So in history as well as the <br/>
sciences there are things that can be said with certainty and those <br/>
things that must be qualified, or just plain remain speculative.<br/>
<br/>
Nina wrote:<br/>

Now to get on a level of my own experience. When I decided to write <br/>
"Stray<br/>
Dogs," a fictional account of the life of one of the 47 Ako ronin, Fuwa<br/>
Kazuemon (anyone can read the story on the Samurai Archives web site), I<br/>
didn't write the story to "entertain." I also did NOT write the story to<br/>
state that this is THE FACTS about his life. I couldn't do that and I <br/>
don't<br/>
know any historian, even those with multiple degrees in history who <br/>
could.<br/>
Simply because so many gaps exist in his life. I wrote the story <br/>
because I<br/>
am interested in this man's life and thus wanted to delve into it a bit<br/>
more.<br/>
---<br/>
'I also did NOT write the story to state that this is THE FACTS about <br/>
his life.'  <-- Makes sense to me, since it is, as you say, a fictional <br/>
account.  It seems perfectly reasonable to me take a historical <br/>
personage and write fiction based upon them, using the available <br/>
information as a 'jumping off point'.  I would say that this is what <br/>
Clavell does to great effect in _Shogun_, but knowing that your writing <br/>
is fictional (like the film Seppuku), I am going to doubt the <br/>
veracity/accuracy of anything I read in there that isn't foot-/end- <br/>
noted.<br/>
<br/>
'I don't know any historian, even those with multiple degrees in <br/>
history...'  <-- Still not sure what this is all about.<br/>
<snip><br/>
<br/>
---<br/>
So in history there are things that are knowable and my position is <br/>
that all sources are not created equal.  No sources can be accepted <br/>
with an uncritical eye, but primary sources are best, properly cited <br/>
and peer-reviewed secondary sources (based on primary sources) come <br/>
next.  My personal opinion is that narrative histories -- histories <br/>
that try to tell a story in a story format -- too often fall into the <br/>
Rashomon trap.  That is, the 'story' lies in the eye of the beholder.<br/>

here. When I say "History Book", Osprey (no offense<br/>
Tony) is on the low end of that spectrum. Turnbull's<br/>
editing errors alone clearly put them into question at<br/>
times--you've really got to read and evaluate. We're<br/>
talking things that researchers are writing, who look<br/>
at primary sources. Sansom, Sadler, Farris, Varley,<br/>
Keene, etc...this is what we mean by 'History'. (Okay,<br/>
I'll include Bryant, so he doesn't hurt me.) As much<br/>
as I love Rekishi Gunzo, it's pulp history--a recent<br/>
copy about ninja made me gag. <br/>

facts, present several of the most likely/commonly<br/>

<br/>
This has turned into a criticism of history work,<br/>
which is fine. Unfortunately, I'm at a loss as to why<br/>
it became this. My statements were originally to the<br/>
effect that fiction is fiction, history is history,<br/>
and that if you want the facts of history, go study<br/>
history. The only argument to that that I can see<br/>
would be the opposite: historical facts are better<br/>
found in fiction than in history books. Is this what<br/>
you, Nina, and you, Onnagozen, are indeed saying? Can<br/>
you please explain how in the world you would reach<br/>
this conclusion? I think it's fairly cynical (and<br/>
trust me, I'm as cynical as they come, so you can<br/>
imagine my shock) to say that watching a move would<br/>
teach you more about actual, factual history than<br/>
opening a history book would. While today's kids may<br/>
embrace that method of teaching, personally, I'd be<br/>
horrified if for history class everyday my kids<br/>
chucked the textbooks and popped in "Gone with the<br/>
Wind" to learn about the US Civil War. As much as I<br/>
love Taiga Drama, I don't see Japanese students<br/>
watching "Hideyoshi" as definitive fact of the rise of<br/>
Toyotomi. <br/>

vehicle to carry across simple facts, yes, that's<br/>
entertainment. <br/>

 </span></blockquote>"Discuss history" is quite separate from "outline<br/>
historical facts". Certainly you could use the movie<br/>
to discuss the situation of the times that the movie<br/>
depicts. Does it represent historical fact? No. Can it<br/>
give you insight into historical facts? Quite<br/>
possibly. It's still not historical record, NOR IS IT<br/>
INTENDED TO BE. You keep saying that even books<br/>
intended to be history need to be checked and verified<br/>
and (with as much as you say it) believed only<br/>
skeptically--HOW MUCH MORE A WORK OF FICTION?<br/>
