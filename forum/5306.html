 </span></blockquote>I assume you mean if they were caught? Generally,<br/>
criminals who were caught were crucified. <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1752618050">You weren't thick, Denis! -I- was a little vague. I meant in an instance in which: <br/>
<br/>
A samurai serves a Daimyo. <br/>
The Daimyo's son kills his own father in a coup. <br/>
The samurai attempts to assassinate the son out of loyalty to his dead master. <br/>
The samurai is apprehended. <br/>
Would he be forced to commit seppuku, or be inflicted a different kind of death?<br/>
<br/>
Thanks, Nate, for your input about the crucifixion of the criminals! yes, I meant apprehended criminals. Were hangings practiced in Edo Japan at all, for any reason?<br/>
<br/>
I am sorry for not contributing much of my own to the topics suggested in the group. I have only been researching about samurai history for the past few months, and respect people who are much more knowledgeable than I am! This all goes a novel I am writing. I am doing a lot of reading on my own, and my questions usually come up from conflicting information I gather, or topics to which I haven't found a solid answer. <br/>
<br/>
Time will be my teacher (and books... and you guys...) Thank you!<br/>

 </span></blockquote>If we're talking Edo period, most likely the son would<br/>
be put to death. The bakufu didn't take kindly to ANY<br/>
type of coup or insurrection--if they allowed the son<br/>
to revolt against his father, what's to stop someone<br/>
from revolting against them? A son overthrowing a<br/>
father would be against the entire Confucian value<br/>
system enforced. <br/>
<br/>
If we're talking Sengoku, then it could go either way.<br/>

The samurai in this case would have no problem during the Edo period <br/>
IF he followed the proper prescribed procedures as laid down by the <br/>
Shogunate. This would involve presenting your claim for vendetta to <br/>
the government and getting the OK to proceed. Such "revenge" killings <br/>
were accepted and pretty much considered a duty. After the samurai <br/>
had received the OK, tracked down the son, and killed him, he would <br/>
have to report his act to the local authorities along with presenting <br/>
his documentation. Also, in pursuing your vendetta, you could not <br/>
create a riotous situation or (in theory at least) risk the safety of <br/>
uninvolved parties. Then the samurai would go his merry way without <br/>
any negative legal consequences at all, having fulfilled his duty. Of <br/>
course, this could invite a vendetta from the just killed son's <br/>
family/retainers....<br/>
If the samurai just killed the son without following the rules, it <br/>
was up to the authorities to decide his fate based on the situation<br/>
(in your case, since the son had staged a coup and the father's <br/>
retainer killed him, the retainer might get off with a 'slap on the <br/>
wrist'). <br/>
Before the Edo period, revenge killings were expected but not codifed <br/>
as during the Shogunate (at least not on a national level) so the <br/>
local reaction to a revenge or duty killing varied greatly. <br/>
In either case, the son in question is dead meat during the Edo <br/>
period-even if the samurai didn't get him the government would <br/>
(crucifixtion).</div>

<br/>
Yes, lots of them. Not so much during the Edo period where <br/>
crucifixtion was the standard, but during the Sengoku period and <br/>
before, the forms of execution were pretty much subject to the local <br/>
warlord's whims. Just about anything was done...one of the most <br/>
gruesome being one of the Saito clan boiling an enemy to death in a <br/>
large cauldron (much like Lord Yabu did in Clavell's Shogun). This <br/>
also happened to the notorious bandit Ishikawa Goemon. Another <br/>
warlord (sorry, don't recall who) was buried up to his neck with a <br/>
bamboo saw placed next to him and a sign inviting passersby to feel <br/>
free to have a go at him (Clavell used this too, for Lord Ishida). <br/>
Beating a man to death was common as was death during torture (which <br/>
wasn't a planned execution, but just sped up the process).</div>
