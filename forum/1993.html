<div id="ygrps-yiv-295732502">"In 1854, Commodore Perry and his Black Ships steamed into <br/>
Yokohama Bay to force Japan open at gunpoint," writes William <br/>
Deresiewicz, who teaches English at Yale. "Within 14 years, <br/>
Japan had embarked on a crash program of modernization. The <br/>
opening of the Japanese mind incited, inevitably, a <br/>
reciprocal awakening in the American one." <br/>
<br/>
Christopher Benfey's book tells the story of the "gifted, <br/>
intrepid men and women, American and Japanese," who were at <br/>
"the hot edge where two very different cultures were coming <br/>
into contact" during the half-century before World War I, <br/>
says Deresiewicz. "The lives of certain key figures unfold <br/>
across the whole arc of the book, attaining something <br/>
approaching the weight of fiction," he comments. <br/>
<br/>
Describing the intersections between these peoples' lives, <br/>
Deresiewicz writes, "Kakuzo Okakura, the connoisseur, curator <br/>
and cultural historian mentored by Ernest Fenollosa, the <br/>
Tokyo philosophy professor instrumental in shaping Japanese <br/>
fine arts policy, mentors in turn John La Farge, the painter <br/>
most responsible for bringing Japanese aesthetic ideas and <br/>
methods to American art." <br/>
<br/>
"The structure is symphonic," writes Deresiewicz, "a symphony <br/>
not only of characters but of ideas." Benfey "brings to his <br/>
subject a scholar's thoroughness, a critic's astuteness and a <br/>
storyteller's sense of drama." <br/>
