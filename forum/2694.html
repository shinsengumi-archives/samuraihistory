<h3>Samura battle tactics</h3>
by <i>richardomura</i>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-450459637">Hello, I just joined. I am an aficionado not just of Samurai history <br/>
but also of ancient warfare in general. I am a sansei, third <br/>
generation Japanese-American who speaks Japanese fluently (but read <br/>
very little) and have lived in Japan for 18 years.<br/>
<br/>
I noticed that in studying classical Roman and Greek warfare, that <br/>
there is much information on group warfare: phalanxes, troop <br/>
organizations, siege weapons, strategy, but little on individual <br/>
combat. <br/>
<br/>
Conversely, in studying Japanese warfare (with English books) there <br/>
are lots of info on individual combat but almost nothing on battle <br/>
formations, battle strategy, and group warfare. I realize this is <br/>
because traditionally Samurai called out their lineage to their <br/>
opponents and fought individually only with those who they considered <br/>
worthy.<br/>
<br/>
I read that this practice began to change with the Mongol invasion, <br/>
as the Mongols couldn't understand Japanese, and that slowly, this <br/>
practice of calling out their lineage and past heroism began to fade.<br/>
<br/>
So the question is, did the Samurai ever begin to form troop <br/>
formations such as the phalanx, maniples, in order to fight as a <br/>
group?<br/>
<br/>
A book I recently read, "Carnage and Culture" implies that they did <br/>
not. That the reason western armies were so successful around the <br/>
world is because they employed these troop formations that rather <br/>
than focusing on individual combat.<br/>
<br/>
Regardless, does anybody know where I can find info on Samurai group <br/>
strategies and troop formations rather than individual discipline and <br/>
man to man fighting?<br/>
<br/>
Regards,<br/>
Richard</div>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-29959055">I'm not deeply versed on the subject of specific<br/>
formations and the like, but I do know I have about 8<br/>
jpg's of Japanese battle formations after firearms<br/>
started seeing regular usage, so I'm assuming these<br/>
particular ones were used in the short span from the<br/>
time Oda Nobunaga rose to power to when the Toyotomi<br/>
line was killed off.  If you'd like, I can try and<br/>
send them to you personally.<br/>
<br/>
Also, in the book "samurai warfare" there's a good<br/>
deal of paintings and plates of large Japanese armies<br/>
either going into or in the midsts of battle.  The<br/>
book as well as several others also tell how battles<br/>
were generally fought, usually with the highest<br/>
ranking general (shokun, daimyo, whatever word you<br/>
want to use) watching from a nearby hill or some other<br/>
place to get a good overview of the field.  Each<br/>
daimyo, and possibly highly celebrated warriors of<br/>
lesser rank, had a standard bearer to show where his<br/>
force was on the field, and the head general from high<br/>
atop his hill would send specifically chosen runners<br/>
(I forget what book it was but I did read a great deal<br/>
on the importance, training and ability of these<br/>
chosen message carriers) to relay messages/orders<br/>
between himself and each standard worthy leader. <br/>
Below that I think each leader was pretty much<br/>
responsible for his own type of organization amongst<br/>
his troops.<br/>
<br/>
Wearing sashimono was obviously one way of keeping<br/>
order and telling who was who on the battlefield, and<br/>
the previously mentioned standards also helped.  I<br/>
beleive I read that one of the reasons that there's<br/>
not much written on Japanese mass warfare is that the<br/>
Japanese never had any great literary generals like<br/>
the west did.  Generals were too busy warring most of<br/>
the time so most of the accounts we have of battles<br/>
before the end of Sengoku Jidai are accounts written<br/>
by people not in the military.  And this is not even<br/>
taking into the account the possible number of lost<br/>
records during such an unsteady time as the Sengoku<br/>
period.<br/>
<br/>
I beleive Japanese warfare was very highly regulated<br/>
much like their wastern counterparts, I think it's<br/>
nearly impossible for a country with a history of so<br/>
much war to have gotten by just sort of "winging it",<br/>
and reading of genius minds like Hideyoshi Toyotomi, a<br/>
man who once had the perspective to use the seasonal<br/>
monsoons of Japanese to submerge a castle he was<br/>
beseiging, I just can't see the Japanese being so<br/>
inept at mass warfare as nearly everyone insists that<br/>
they are.<br/>
<br/>
I am a full blooded american with nothing but<br/>
anglo-saxon roots, but it offends me to hear Japanese<br/>
warfare spoken of in such a negative fashion these<br/>
days.  It used to be left at "the Japanese were more<br/>
specialized and better at personal combat whereas the<br/>
Europeans were better at keeping order and mass<br/>
combat", but even that is being challenged these days<br/>
by people who insist in the superiorty of European<br/>
fencing, unarmed combat and actually have the gull to<br/>
compare the european sword to the katana.<br/>
<br/>
I could rant on, but I'll do that some other time.<br/>

Seems like after 18 years it is time to start crunching those kanji! I <br/>
recommend the works of Sasama Yoshihiko. "Nihon Senjin Saho Jiten" has <br/>
some especially good entries on battle formations and tactics, along <br/>
with some enlightening bits on battlefield customs...<br/>

I may still get to reading Kanji someday. But meanwhile, how about briefing me on what you read. Did the Samurai have something equivalent to the phalanx? Did the front lines hold even and try to penetrate each other's defenses or was the battle similiar to what is usually shown on tv and film where the warriors inter-penetrate each other's lines and get involved in numerous man-to-man melees all over the field with no clear demarcation of sides? I'm thinking that was probably the case in Japan, that that was the reason why they needed the sashimono, so they would know who was on who's side. <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1504351188">Hi Craz,<br/>
<br/>
Sure please send the jpg's if they're not too big.<br/>
Regarding comparison's between European and Japanese martial ways, I think it's like comparing apples and tangerines.<br/>
But there are some things that can definitely be compared. The sword for one, as you mentioned. Most experts consider the Japanese swords as the best swords ever made, even compared with edged blades made under current technological specifications. And in my opinion, I consider the Greek phalanx under Alexander the most awesome and fearsome infantry battle formation ever created. Can you imagine facing a quarter mile front of 16 to 18 foot pikes, with spearheads five deep? Even if you get past the first one, you got four more in your face, not to mention from all sides. No matter how good the Samurai warrior was in individual combat, I think they would have shared the same fate as all those that Alexander confronted and destroyed. But, that's just my opinion. We'll never know as Alexander never got that far. It would also have been interesting to see how the Mongols would have fared in an all-out war against the Samurai. Since the Mongol invasion was thwarted by typhoons, there were only a few brief skirmishes in which the Samurai is said to have done well. A full on war would have changed the history of Japan as we know it.<br/>

Can you expand on your statement that Sengoku period armies were using<br/>
firearms 'to greater effect than Europeans, and on a much more massive<br/>
scale'?<br/>
What are your sources?<br/>
I agree that Japanese armies of this period were generally more tactically<br/>
sophisticated than their European counterparts throughout this period - at<br/>
least until the reforms of Maurice of Nassau in the Dutch Army and the<br/>
(slightly later) reforms of Gustavas Adolphus of Sweden.<br/>
Where the Europeans appear to have developed a definite advantage is in the<br/>
use of siege artillery, naval technology and naval artillery. Gustavus<br/>
Adolphus also used lighter, small-calibre field guns to give his infantry<br/>
added firepower.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>True, in the period of about 1575-1615 or so the Japanese possibly have <br/>
the largest modern army on the planet. Most impressive. More discussions <br/>
about this appeared on the sca-jml list recently.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Tactics for Spain and the rest of Europe were roughly the same as Japan, <br/>
i.e. musket and pike/yari. Japan had many fine generals as did Europe. <br/>
Certainly Sengoku had honed their treachery, err.. political skills as <br/>
well. I would hesitate about the much greater effect since many Western <br/>
armies had some form of drill in this period.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Remotely possible but I highly doubt that 200 more years of warfare <br/>
would have modernized Japan to the degree that happened in Europe. Japan <br/>
didn't have the access to resources that Europe had and if they had <br/>
expanded they may have experienced the same problems that Spain and <br/>
other previously great powers had. Also I would argue that Japan wasn't <br/>
a country until Meiji and that the individual provinces were still <br/>
thinking of independence and kicking out the Tokugawa, which is eventual <br/>
what happened. Of course this puts them on par with Italy and Germany <br/>
which are both fairly modern themselves.<br/>

<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1980667909">Agreed that the Japanese never used siege weapons<br/>
(cannons, etc.) to the extent that the Europeans did,<br/>
though they did appear on the battlefield (the cannon<br/>
from the Liefde, William Adams's ship, were used at<br/>
Sekigahara) and in sieges (Osaka Castle, 1615). <br/>
<br/>
Tactical employment of arquebuses was well advanced in<br/>
Japan. Everyone is usually familiar with Nagashino<br/>
(1575) and the rotating firing system, and it is often<br/>
used as an example of this before it appears in<br/>
Europe. What most people do not realize is that this<br/>
wasn't nearly the first such instance--just the<br/>
largest stage for it. Rotational fire had occured as<br/>
early as the mid 1560's for sure (Ikko-ikki) and<br/>
Turnbull discusses it as early as 1560 in his Samurai<br/>
Sourcebook. At Nagashino we see 3000 (though some<br/>
recent scholarly debate has asserted the number was<br/>
closer to 1000) guns used in conjunction with natural<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1008011085">One more input on the Nagashino battle,<br/>
There is one battle very similar to the Nagashino<br/>
bewtween Wu and Yiieh kingdoms during an ancient<br/>
Chinese civil war period (Spring and Autumn Period,<br/>
about 300 B.C. for this case)<br/>
It was the first time when crossbows were invented and<br/>
used to pin down calvary soldires of Wu armed with<br/>
long spears.It was also one of conflits when Suntzu<br/>
initially involved himself in earlier. <br/>
I thought that some of you may be interested.<br/>

While I agree with the general thrust of your argument, I remain sceptical<br/>
simply because most english source material is rather vague and makes<br/>
sweeping generalisations. I reckon there is a great research project waiting<br/>
here for someone who's prepared to study Japanese sources and compare what<br/>
was happening in Japan with military developments in Europe.<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>No, this is just not the case. Rotation of ranks, firing by 'introduction',<br/>
'extraduction' or whatever you want to call it was already happening in<br/>
Europe. In fact it was the only effective way that ranks of<br/>
arquebusiers/musketeers could keep up a steady stream of fire. Volley or<br/>
'salvo' (ie firing all ranks together) could be devastating if troops held<br/>
their nerve, but was risky since there would now be a time lapse before they<br/>
had all reloaded.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> > At Nagashino we see 3000 (though some<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Even 3000 would still be a very small percentage of Nobunaga's army (less<br/>
than 10%). Most European armies would have had a higher percentage of<br/>
firearms than that. Perhaps it was the combination of arquebusiers with<br/>
archers plus obstacles (?).<br/>
Perhaps the heavy rain the previous night was decisive (remember the French<br/>
knights floundering in the mud at Agincourt?). Nobunaga's use of obstacles<br/>
may have been a stroke of genius, but even this has already been used in<br/>
Europe to great effect during the Italian Wars 50 years previous.<br/>
