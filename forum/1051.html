<h3>Philosophical question about samurai I havent been drinking!</h3>
by <i>samurai182uk</i>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-366716179">Hello everyone<br/>
<br/>
I wonder if you lot could help me with something.  The thing is you <br/>
see I have recently been having a problem with faith, you see, not in <br/>
the religious way at all. But to do with the samurai of the past, <br/>
sometimes I want to believe all what is written about these great <br/>
people, sometimes it seems to be just exagerated, these historical <br/>
figures are like characters literally in a game or movie, Nobunaga <br/>
the cruel, dominant stiffled dictator, Hideyoshi- the rags to riches <br/>
story, or should that be the ashigaru to daimyo story. whatever. <br/>
Tokugawa Ieyasu the man who ate the cake, took the glory.  If you go <br/>
further back you have Yoshitsune the tragic hero, Benkkei the warrior <br/>
monk who accomplished amazing feats. I know in the history of all <br/>
countries all have their heroes, in British history we have the <br/>
charge of the light brigade the victory against the armada. But I <br/>
don't think their are really any mythological characters. I am not an <br/>
expert but sometimes I think why I am drawn to Japan is that the <br/>
history is all around Japanese society even the cities of Japan are <br/>
sometimes based on the names of feudal era castles, or vice versa.  <br/>
Popular authors who we all read like master Stephen Turnbull <br/>
constantly are giving this rosy view somemight say corny blossom <br/>
view, but I understand Japan is a bit like this sometimes the poems <br/>
are mostly very tragic, all or nothing affairs. All I am saying is <br/>
that the truth is sometimes very much distorted. What got me thinking <br/>
like this is that 1. I read a certain book, 2. I read George Sansoms <br/>
book )much more realistic I think.3. I have been looking at Japanese <br/>
maps studying place names, seeing the history literally engrained <br/>
into the landscape. I don't know, I just wonder sometimes what the <br/>
Bushi of the past would think of us saying oh this guy was the best <br/>
samurai because he conquered such and such an area. Killed so many <br/>
people. You know how much can we actually understand about the <br/>
samurai. Oh sorry to rant on and on. I hope I made some point, this <br/>
is a disscussion group after all, my favourite samurai was Akechi <br/>
Mitsuhide, but I guess you could guess through my comments. Was he a <br/>
good samurai? I don't know, but atleast he put an end to Nobunaga <br/>
rest his soul.  Sigh, <br/>
<br/>
what do others think? I don't think I have lost the interest in <br/>
Japan, just I am more wary/weary of the truth.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1206173394">A good portion (though not all) of the 'history' of the Sengoku era<br/>
was written in the 17th and 18th centuries - decades or more after the<br/>
fact, so that alone makes things a bit questionable (although I assume<br/>
they were using documents contemporary to the Sengoku to write thier<br/>
histories).  Also, god only knows how many hundreds or thousands of<br/>
pages of firsthand information kept in temples and shrines around<br/>
japan was destroyed by allied bombers during WWII - who knows what<br/>
sort of information was lost.  Not to mention the fact that in some<br/>
cases, some actual decendants of various clans are STILL holding<br/>
tightly to personal letters and firsthand accounts from the 16th<br/>
century without letting scholars getting a look at it because it is<br/>
'family matters'.  The Sengoku era is still being slowly pieced<br/>
together bit by bit, many temples have storage rooms that probably<br/>
havent been gone through in decades.  Last time I was in Japan, I went<br/>
to a temple in Yamashina, Kyoto that after over 100 years brought out<br/>
a contemporary wood carving of Tokugawa Ieyasu that had been sitting<br/>
in one such storage room.  Believe it or not, new Sengoku era<br/>
information is still coming to light.  Within the past 8-10 years I<br/>
read somewhere that some new documents found in a temple shed some new<br/>
light on one of the sengoku clans (can't remember any details.)  This<br/>
is probably why all the bookstores not only have shelves and shelves<br/>
of books exclusively on the Sengoku period, but also why there are new<br/>
Sengoku period books coming out yearly, if not monthly.  The<br/>
scholarship in the West is decades and decades behind Japan -<br/>
especiallly when you have almost all of the 'classics' about the<br/>
Sengoku in the West were written between 20 - 40 years ago, including<br/>
Sansom, Berry, Hall, etc.<br/>
<br/>
I'm still waiting for the new Sengoku scholarship renaissance to hit<br/>
the West.</div>
