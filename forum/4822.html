<div id="ygrps-yiv-708448504"><blockquote><span title="ireply">> I was talking about the use of carrier pigeons in times of war with <br/>
 </span></blockquote>some Japanese friends at the weekend and they said they thought <br/>
these pigeons were used in the sengoku period. Does anyone on the <br/>
board have confirmation of this or a historical reference? (A google <br/>
search shows they were used by the ancient Egyptians and in WW1, but <br/>
not much information on the intervening period.)<br/>
<br/>
Thanks,<br/>
