<br/>
From the 1550's until his death in 1582, Oda Nobunaga was involved in constant warfare. One by one, the major Daimyo of his era - the Imagawa, the Takeda, the Asai and Asakura and others - fell before his armies. This episode, we give a concise history of Nobunaga's ambition to unify the country under his rule, from the pivotal battle of Okehazama that first put him on the national stage, to his betrayal at the hands of Akechi Mitsuhide.<br/>

I was wondering if any of these recent podcasts covered the Uesugi's Otate no Ran.<br/>
If not, is there any chance that a future one might?<br/>
You had previously asked us for areas of interest, but then you mentioned that many of these areas were to specific/niche.<br/>
Just wondering.  I would still like to hear more about the period following Kenshin's death.<br/>
<br/>
thanks!<br/>

<br/>
But seriously, if you know of English language sources, I can read about it on my own.  However, I have not found any... and my japanese is not good enough to read historical texts.  Although... now with google translator... who knows.<br/>

Anyone know if the information contained within is accurate, or if this website is trustworthy?<br/>
<br/>
It has a lot of information regarding the Otate no ran that I had not heard of before, but the Takeda aspects match with what I have heard about Katsuyori deciding to support Kagekatsu.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-663898041">That's basically my question too.  Some of the "translations" look like they are either historical or glossary-like descriptions.<br/>
<br/>
This FAQ:<br/>
Q: I found an error in your translation/scanlation/research. What do I do?<br/>
A: Good for you! Please email me. <br/>
<br/>
This makes me think that some of the translations are historical, and the Otate no Ran article is written in a way that suggests looking at historical sources.<br/>
Additionally, the glossary has an "historical/real people" section.  And while not every entry completely matches what the equivalent entry at Samurai Archives says, they appear to align well.<br/>
<br/>
There are also "sources" at the bottom of many/most articles.  For Otate no Ran:<br/>

I translated the wikipedia article (via google translate) and it was a pretty funny read.  <br/>
