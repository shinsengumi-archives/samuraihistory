<h3>Kai Doh Maru?</h3>

<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-744125565">Who or what exactly was Kai Doh Maru or Kaidohmaruu in the Heian Period <br/>
Era? What does the term mean? It's from an anime of the same name which <br/>
is about a female posing as a male warrior to save her own life. From <br/>
her own family yet. Arigatou and SFN. See ya soon and Kami bless you <br/>
all. Toodles-K&K</div>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Basically, it's a nominalizer for "Strong youth" -- Kaidou is "Strong  <br/>
youth" or "stalwart lad" or somesuch.<br/>
<br/>
Maru is an old-fashioned name-ending suffix. (I hate to make the  <br/>
comparison, but the first thing that comes to mind to compare to it is  <br/>
the diminutive suffix "-kins" like in Veronica calling Archie "Archie- <br/>
kins" (which is also the root of the modern name "Jenkins").<br/>
<br/>
For the record, Kaidomaru is also supposedly the adult name of Kintaro  <br/>
of children's tale fame.<br/>
<br/>
Ultimately, it's a name.<br/>
<br/>
Kaidomaru.<br/>
<br/>
It's one word.<br/>
<br/>
Like Mathilda or Richard or Evangeline or Alexander. Just a name.<br/>
<br/>
And any site or person who renders it "Kai Doh Maru" is not to be  <br/>
trusted -- they are idjits. And if the packagers in Japan are  <br/>
producing it that way, they are DOUBLY idiots.<br/>
<br/>
It's like a film called "MA CHI KO" or "TAH KEH SHI".<br/>
<br/>
Damn, that just annoys me on a level that I really can't explain.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-988838536">While I strongly urge people not to get there historical information from anime... The story you may be looking for is actually a Japanese legend whose main character is a general by the name of Raiko (Minamoto Yorimitsu) who fights the demon-being Shutendoji. Sadamitsu and Kintoki accompany Raiko and defeat the demon by cutting its head off.<br/>
<br/>
I'm not sure where you can find more info on this legend, but hopefully that helps.<br/>
<br/>
Good day,<br/>
