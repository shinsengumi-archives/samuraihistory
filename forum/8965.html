<h3>Not a Choctaw...he was a Chinook</h3>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1343146750">My mistake... the guy I was refering to was a Chinook who was born in <br/>
America, but lived in Canada (in a Metis boarding school). <br/>
<br/>
  Apparently, he believed that Japan was "the ancestors" (which was way <br/>
before anybody postulated that Native Americans were Asian descendants) <br/>
and he traveled to Japan.<br/>
<br/>
      Anyway, I found many sites with info, so if nobody feels that <br/>
posting info on this guy, that will be fine.<br/>
<br/>
 Thanks!</div>
