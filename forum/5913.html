<br/>
How interesting to see that you are in a re-enactment group under the title of "Shogun". I am a member of a mainly German based organisation, but with international members, also with the name Shogun. We combine a group of "like minded people" who have interest in the Samurai - whether it be research, modelling, flatfigure collecting, wargaming or re-enactment.....  <br/>
<br/>
We broke away from the German KLIO zinnfigur organisation to create a seperate "Arbeitsgruppe" in 1985, so next year will be our 20th anniversary. I have been trying to get a web site up and running for three years but decided to save the registration/hosting fee until its finished!! We actually produce a range of 30mm zinnfigur (tin figures) and meet up every year in Goslar for a "private" weekend and every two years at Kulmbach in Bavaria at the Zinnfigur Borse.<br/>
<br/>
Perhaps we should compare notes and have a chat...... because what is even more remarkable is that I do also dwell in Stevenage, UK !!  Have I even met you in the past??<br/>
<br/>
Regards,<br/>
