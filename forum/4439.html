<br/>
My name is David Erickson , Im new to this yahoo group. About a week <br/>
since joining. Im very impressed with the group so far , Thanks for <br/>
having me aboard. I have a living history society called the <br/>
M.R.S.N.E.(Military Re-neactment Society of New England) one of our <br/>
affiliated living history groups is called Daimyo of the Samurai . It <br/>
is dedicated to the History, religion, and the way of the Samurai and <br/>
will express its self during time line events in costume as Samurai <br/>
and as the Samurai families. In the spring 2005 I plan to purchase a <br/>
horse and complete a mounted Samurai impression to show off during <br/>
time line event. Also along with the armor and weapons. I also have <br/>
studied martial arts for the past 20 yrs in Kendo, kung fu and Tae <br/>
Kwon Do. I am in the research phase now; to learn every thing I can <br/>
about every aspect of the Samurai, This Yahoo group has already been <br/>
a great help to me in so far as research. I will have many questions <br/>
in the near future. <br/>
<br/>
Thanks<br/>

Welcome to the group! I'm a newcomer myself, but I have been <br/>
enjoying everything so far. Let us know if you have any specific <br/>
topics of interest or questions.<br/>
<br/>
By the way - a horse and full costume sounds cool (and expensive!).<br/>
