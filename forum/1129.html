<h3>One vs. Matsu?</h3>
by <i>ltdomer98</i>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1563827615">I've got a question regarding the relationships<br/>
between Kinoshita Tokichiro (the future<br/>
Hashiba/Toyotomi Hideyoshi) and his wife One, and<br/>
Maeda Toshiie and his wife Matsu. Most of what I've<br/>
read that touches on the subject is fictional works,<br/>
notably Eiji Yoshikawa's "Taiko" and Taiga Drama. If<br/>
you listen to Yoshikawa's story and the "Hideyoshi"<br/>
Taiga drama (1996), One was pursued by both Tokichiro<br/>
and Toshiie, and Tokichiro won her heart and married<br/>
her. It's portrayed as part of his charm, how he could<br/>
get this wonderfully beautiful (and smart) woman who<br/>
was above his station to love the little monkey, etc. <br/>
<br/>
After watching the first 4 episodes of "Toshiie to<br/>
Matsu" (1997, I think?) the story it tells is that One<br/>
and Matsu were vying for Toshiie's affections, and<br/>
Matsu won. One was ordered by Nobunaga to marry<br/>
"Saru-dono" (Monkey Lord) Tokichiro, and she was very<br/>
unhappy about it. <br/>
<br/>
I know that all this is fiction. My question is, is<br/>
there anything academic that documents the relations<br/>
between the 4, and what is the truth about their<br/>
relationships? Or is it all left open to fictional<br/>
interpretation? I figured the Ehon Taiko-ki wouldn't<br/>
go into great detail about how the great Taiko's wife<br/>
didn't want to marry him. <br/>
<br/>
It is very interesting to watch the two different<br/>
Taiga Drama's and see the differences. Quite funny,<br/>
actually. <br/>

<h3>Re: [samuraihistory] One vs. Matsu?</h3>
by <i>Mikiko Letham</i>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-177780396">Not being an academic I can't say about sources though I think this one<br/>
topic that would be hard to ascertain the true facts. Andrea Brascaro did<br/>
edit some book of Hideyoshis letters. I've never seen it but I hazard to<br/>
guess it wouldn't shed any light either. As for the drama itself, (which is<br/>
this years by the way episode 33 aired sunday night) I'm rather<br/>
dissappointed especially in the battle scenes or lack thereof, Okehazama was<br/>
a mess and Shizugatake wasn't even there. This was a let down following the<br/>
CG enhanced battles from 2000s Aoi Tokugawa Sandai, and last years Hojo<br/>
Tokimune. However my wife loves it, and its been a hit in the ratings<br/>
staying in the top five dramas. Taiga drama has basically become a 'trendy'<br/>
jidaigeki drama. I wonder what NHK will do with next years Musashi? Another<br/>
drama I saw had Hideyoshi in love with Ochi, Nobunagas sister. I don't think<br/>
they will ever make a drama about the 'relationship' between Nobunaga and<br/>
Toshiie though..<br/>

<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1172545400">While I sit around the house reading books on swords and armour my wife reads<br/>
"The women of Heian Kyo" and "Sengoku Busho no Onna-tachi". I don't watch the<br/>
Taiga dramas anymore and don't know anything about One.<br/>
    However my in house expert insists that Hideyoshi was a good match for her<br/>
at that point in her life, not a step down. She was charmed she thinks,<br/>
afterall Hideyoshi must have possesed some charm to become the leader he was,<br/>
and take control of the country.<br/>
    She believes that the two women never competed, they met later in life and<br/>
became friends then.<br/>
    She also says "tell you friends to stop watching television..."<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1953170957">I'd agree with this (- the female point of view perhaps?) I read the<br/>
translation of Hideyoshi's letters a while ago and what remains in my<br/>
mind is a  man of some charm, interested in all aspects of the lives of<br/>
the women of his household. (I believe it didn't stop him putting some<br/>
of them to death later.)<br/>
