<h3>If you could be a great Military leader how would you be?</h3>
by <i>shadowhawke666</i>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1540258574">Hi fellow warriors,<br/>
     As I was going through my mail this evening I saw a few famous military leaders either mentioned or referred to. A question occured to me- If you could be a famous Military leader from the past who would you be?<br/>
     I think my answer at this point would be possibly split between Ieyasu Tokugawa and Erwin Rommel.<br/>
     My first choice, Ieyasu Tokugawa was the first Shogun of Japan; according to my research, he united Japan; I could elaborate but in fairness this could be a seperate e-mail.<br/>
     My second choice, Erwin Rommel, known as the Desert Fox, again according to my research, was one of Hitler's smartest generals.<br/>
       There you have my answer to the question, what's your answer?  <br/>
        I'd be glad to answer any questions or hear any comments.<br/>
         I closing, I just though it might be interesting or fun to see what answers turned up.<br/>
        Hope to hear from you soon,<br/>
            Shadow</div>

Frankly, I don't think I'd want to be one of Hitler's *anything* regardless of his career.<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
Would I want to live his life, or be myself in his position? If the latter, chances are my choices and actions would be different, thus producing a different ultimate picture. At what point do I "step in" to someone's<br/>
life and take over?<br/>

US Army.<br/>

<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> > <br/>

 </span></blockquote>Tony, relax! It's all in good fun, don't try to read<br/>
too much into it. <br/>
<br/>
Okay, here goes. I've got many choices (and by the<br/>
way, I'm reading this as who would I wish to have the<br/>
same circumstances befall me historically and try to<br/>
live up to what they did. Good compromise?)<br/>
<br/>
Being an ex-tanker, Patton is always a choice...love<br/>
that guy. Sitting Bull or Crazy Horse, just to see<br/>
Custer's face as an arrow went through his<br/>
head...(despite my being a member of 7th Cavalry<br/>
Regiment...Garryowen in Glory) Maybe MacArthur or<br/>
Ridgeway, to see the Korean War ended right, unlike<br/>
the situation now. <br/>
<br/>
I'd have to say my top choice would be Oda Nobunaga,<br/>
and not just because we're on the Samurai list. What a<br/>
fascinating man! I'd love to walk in his shoes for a<br/>
little while, see what went on in his mind. He, in my<br/>
mind, was the absolute master at integrating tactical,<br/>
operational, and strategic levels of warfare. Just to<br/>
glimpse into his decision making process, his<br/>
analysis, his IPB...wow. I'd say Hashiba Hideyoshi<br/>
would be another good choice--not Toyotomi, but<br/>
Hashiba Hideyoshi, so I could examine his<br/>
commander/subordinate relationship with Nobunaga, and<br/>
figure out why these two opposites worked so well<br/>
together. <br/>
<br/>
Just my two yen...it is a rather silly, yet<br/>
interesting question. C'mon, Tony...don't be so<br/>
analytical!!!! <br/>
<br/>
Nate<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-484365273">First, let me tell you, Tony, that I am a big fan of your work.  I have <br/>
read all of your osprey Samurai titles and intend to buy the <br/>
historical game "Sengoku".  The inspiration for purchasing your <br/>
books was the film "Kagemusha" by Kurosawa (probably <br/>
already know that).  Although I have read many historical fiction <br/>
stories and watched a whole crapload of Samurai films, <br/>
Kagemusha made me want to know exactly what happened.  <br/>
Your writing is clear, concise, and direct.  I deeply appreciate <br/>
your contribution to my education and the western knowledge of <br/>
Japanese history.  Maybe Shadowhawke should take to reading <br/>
some of your books to better educate himself with the lineage of <br/>
the Shogun.  He's only off by a few hundred years and a few <br/>
hundred Shogun.<br/>
Now here's my spin on his question...  If you were playing <br/>
Sengoku which daimyo would you play as?<br/>

<h3>Re: [samuraihistory] If you could be a great Military leader how would  you be?</h3>
by <i>Lee Changsub</i>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-2092091518">Winston Churchill as my first choice. He was both a<br/>
great stateman and a strategist. Some people may know<br/>
it. He was the one who wrote a document on how to land<br/>
troops in France after 1941 which General Eisenhower<br/>
used as a reference for his landing plan. He also<br/>
corrected some of mistakes made by American Generals<br/>
(like Gen. Marshall) at the initial war planning right<br/>
after Pearl Harbor.(Gen. Marshall proposed raising one<br/>
million Army and Churchill explained why it was a bad<br/>
idea)<br/>
<br/>
My second choice is Napoleon Bonaparte. I think with<br/>
regard to his ability of organizing and implementing<br/>
the offensive, there was no equal at his life time.<br/>
(Sir Wellington purely took a defensive posture<br/>
whenever he faced with Nopoleon. Even this was not<br/>
successful if he had not had a prussian ally.)<br/>

<h3>Thank you all/ Military leaders</h3>
by <i>mayalan</i>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1072446243">Hi !!<br/>
<br/>
 Thank you all for your answers, we get clear from all<br/>
this that retreating was maybe the only choice, and i<br/>
think that even if shingen were alive at that moment<br/>
he would do the same, but also if shingen were alive<br/>
maybe the meeting between the two armies could occur<br/>
in different circumstances and other time.<br/>
<br/>
 One of the most important aspects to analize from all<br/>
this is the thinkings (i dont know the propper term in<br/>
english) of Katsuyori, and what was the reason he had<br/>
for ordering the attack against the oppinion of his<br/>
generals...<br/>
<br/>
 Across history, we know about about a great number of<br/>
military leaders, such as Alexander the Great,<br/>
Saladdin, Ghengis Kahn, etc, and this could hear a<br/>
little romantic, but one of the most important<br/>
"requirements" for a great military leader, is how<br/>
their soldiers are willing tho figth (and die) for<br/>
him, in this case, i too put Rommel first.  <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-5975214">Your in the U.S army? <br/>
<br/>
This has nothing to do with samurai's by the way.<br/>
<br/>
Are there any military leaders in the U.S army that you could compare to any of the great military leaders of the past?<br/>

<h3>for Tony :) Re: If you could be a great Military leader how would  you be?</h3>
by <i>robbroomuk</i>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-453641702">The question could be better phrased (especially for Tony, who I <br/>
agree with)as follows.<br/>
<br/>
Which Military leader would you like to meet and talk with.<br/>
<br/>
My list is long, but Hannibal and Rommel (for child hood reasons) <br/>
would be top, followed by Caesar and Napoleon.<br/>
Epaminondas for beating the Spartans would be another choice. How did <br/>
he do it?<br/>
<br/>
From the Samurai, (and Nate this is the Samurai list and we need to <br/>
keep on topic for fear of moderation <grin>)<br/>
<br/>
My list is.<br/>
Takeda Shingen and his sons.<br/>
Kusunoki Masashige for giving the ultiminate sacrifice by obeying <br/>
orders.<br/>
Minamoto Yoshitsune (and Benkei)- do I need reasons? <grin><br/>
<br/>
Yes a flight of fancy but the chance to sit and talk with them all <br/>
for some time. <br/>
Wow.<br/>
<br/>
Kind regards<br/>

 </span></blockquote>  Hi Nate,<br/>
        Its strange that one of your choices was Crazy<br/>
Horse; Crazy Horse and I share a few things with him.<br/>
First I walk the same path that he did this is being a<br/>
shaman; I use the term waker between the worlds but it<br/>
describes the same path. Second, I have Native<br/>
American blood in my heritage or family tree.<br/>
         You also mentioned Patton; its odd but when<br/>
making my choices I too thought of Patton; maybe its<br/>
because George read the book written by Rommel on Tank<br/>
Warfare.<br/>
        As I'm writing this, another military leader<br/>
comes to mind- Maj. Greg Boyington of the " Black<br/>
Sheep Squadron".- the tv series left out that right<br/>
after becoming an ace he was shot down and spent most<br/>
of his time in Japan in a POW camp; it wasn't until<br/>
1945(?) that he was released.<br/>
        I watched an interview of Major Boyington; in<br/>
real life he looks more like Sly Stone with glasses or<br/>
maybe Clark Kent without the uniform ( I think you get<br/>
the picture) than Robert Conrad, ( the guy from the<br/>
series WiLd Wild West).<br/>
         Write back and let me know what you think;<br/>
any way keep in touch it seems we have a lot in<br/>
common.<br/>
         Shadow<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Are you saying your question has nothing to do with<br/>
samurai, or that my being in the U.S. Army has nothing<br/>
to do with samurai? If the latter, then if I am asked<br/>
a question about military tactics, then it has a<br/>
serious bearing on how I will answer the question. <br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> > <br/>

> <br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I am assuming you mean currently? The US Army has had<br/>
its share for its short history (Grant, Washington,<br/>
Lee most of his life, Patton, Eisenhower, etc.) If you<br/>
mean currently, that's rather hard to say. Most of the<br/>
above mentioned wouldn't be considered great if there<br/>
had not have been wars for them to fight. I believe<br/>
many great leaders don't stand out until the bullets<br/>
start to fly. But if I had to say anybody that I've<br/>
had contact with, a COL Michael Formica comes to mind.<br/>
He was my squadron commander in a cavalry unit in<br/>
Korea. Tactical genius, and we would have followed him<br/>
anywhere. If he had decided to go to Pyongyang, we'd<br/>
have followed him all the way. <br/>
<br/>
Another might be LTC H.R. McMaster. If you've<br/>
researched the Gulf War at all, he was the cavalry<br/>
company commander that destroyed an Iraqi Republican<br/>
Guard battalion at the Battle of 73 Easting. He's been<br/>
published many times, and is regarded as quite the<br/>
rising star. And I've talked with people who work for<br/>
him (he commands a cavalry squadron in Germany now)<br/>
and they say he really is the tactical genius everyone<br/>
says he is. <br/>
<br/>
Those are just personal observations, and I can only<br/>
speak for what I have seen. <br/>

and did a lot of research on him, the F4U Corsair, and<br/>
the like. He lived not too far from where I grew up in<br/>
Florida. <br/>

Well, I've always been a great fan of Shingen, but politically rather than<br/>

Hideyoshi.<br/>

<h3>RE: [samuraihistory] If you could be a great Military leader how would you be?</h3>
by <i>Brendan Lawrence</i>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-896580663">Hello,<br/>
<br/>
I am new to this group. I'm from Australia. I have an interest in the<br/>
history and origins of the samurai.<br/>
<br/>
In answer to the question at hand, there are several leaders of the past<br/>
which I think were great military leaders, although I debate their ideals<br/>
and philosophies, ie Adolf Hitler. I think Hitler made a crucial error in<br/>
judgment in invading Russia. He should have learned his lesson from Napolean<br/>
who tried and failed. Had've he focused more on other areas and not broken<br/>
the pact with Stalin, then the war would have turned in another direction.<br/>
<br/>
Secondly, Stalin himself was equally brutal. Yet the allies made their<br/>
choice in siding with the lesser of two evils when chosing Stalin as an ally<br/>
over Hitler.<br/>
<br/>
Thirdly, Winston Churchill made a good strategic move by involving the<br/>
United States into the conflict when Britain were obviously facing<br/>
obliteration by the Germans who would no doubt have invaded Britain had've<br/>
the United States become involved. Had've they waited until after the<br/>
Germans occupied Britain, they would not have had a strategic place to<br/>
launch an attack on Europe for D-Day.<br/>
<br/>
Fourth, Attila the Hun. He hasn't gotten a mention at all so I thought that<br/>
he should. He had undoubtedly made an impact on the European continent<br/>
between 950-953 AD, when the Roman Empire was falling. He would have beaten<br/>
the Turks to pillaging Constantinople if he didn't have the appropriate<br/>
siege weapons to break down the heavily fortified walls. The Turks took care<br/>
of that a few hundred years later. However, the effort on Attila's part was<br/>
not wasted. It did allow him to establish his empire and therefore allow his<br/>
efforts to be focused on the west - ie Gaul etc.<br/>
<br/>
Fifth, Genghis Khan, who undoubtedly had invaded more land than any other<br/>
invader to date. No other military leader had achieved such a feat even to<br/>
this day. Had've Genghis not died then it is possible that Europe would have<br/>
had a different destiny.<br/>
<br/>
In conclusion I would like to add that there are a great many other leaders<br/>
who deserve a mention.<br/>
<br/>

Subject:	[samuraihistory] If you could be a great Military leader how would<br/>
you be?<br/>
<br/>
  Hi fellow warriors,<br/>
     As I was going through my mail this evening I saw a few famous military<br/>
leaders either mentioned or referred to. A question occured to me- If you<br/>
could be a famous Military leader from the past who would you be?<br/>
     I think my answer at this point would be possibly split between Ieyasu<br/>
Tokugawa and Erwin Rommel.<br/>
     My first choice, Ieyasu Tokugawa was the first Shogun of Japan;<br/>
according to my research, he united Japan; I could elaborate but in fairness<br/>
this could be a seperate e-mail.<br/>
     My second choice, Erwin Rommel, known as the Desert Fox, again<br/>
according to my research, was one of Hitler's smartest generals.<br/>
       There you have my answer to the question, what's your answer?<br/>
        I'd be glad to answer any questions or hear any comments.<br/>
         I closing, I just though it might be interesting or fun to see what<br/>
answers turned up.<br/>
        Hope to hear from you soon,<br/>
            Shadow<br/>

nothing I'd want to talk to them about, or ask... nothing off the top of my head. My<br/>
list is a combination of people I greatly admire and would like to meet, and people<br/>
whose campaigns I'm curious about.<br/>
<br/>
It didn't occur to me to list people like Stalin and Churchill as I was thinking of<br/>
them more as general bigbosses, rather than commanders in the field. Probably a<br/>
shortsighted view, but...<br/>

 </span></blockquote>LOL! Frankly, yes. The tacticians and strategists I definitely want to talk<br/>
to. But how could you *not* talk to the guys in the trenches?  The greatest<br/>
tactician is nothing if the only army he commands is a chessboard, and his<br/>
soldiers can't or won't fight.<br/>
<br/>
I think of it this way: The generals write the titles and chapter headings,<br/>
while the soldiers actually fill in the individual paragraphs.<br/>
<br/>
The trouble is, *most* people don't want to read stories about the little<br/>
guy; they want sweeping tales of battle where the "little guy" is a<br/>
regiment.<br/>

Krasnovian Mech Inf BN's defending in sector...<br/>
<br/>
Yeah, I find I learn more from "Joe" than from anybody<br/>
who outranks me. "Joe" has as much to give to a<br/>
leader/commander as the leader/commander has to give<br/>
to him, and if the commander gives of himself, "Joe"<br/>
will do anything for him. You could have the best<br/>
PLAN, but if you don't have the tools to execute...<br/>

 </span></blockquote>That's too bad, because a. some of the most<br/>
interesting stories of war are at the battalion level<br/>
and below...usually down in the companies and squads.<br/>
b. Small unit actions are what wins wars...you don't<br/>
win house to house, you never take the key objectives<br/>
that accomplish the general's operational goals. <br/>

Whittlesy, Patton, Marshall, Clarke, Yamamoto, etc.<br/>

military men and military thinkers. De Charnay, William Marshall, King Rene,<br/>
Sunzi, Geoffrey de Buillon, etc.<br/>

In Japanese terms -- historically -- The list is longer.<br/>

Tenchi Tenno, Masakado, Yoshitsune, Yoritomo, Kiyomori, Takauji, Yoshisada,<br/>

<br/>
I would definitely hop into a  time machine and go back to Munich in the<br/>
early 1930's. I will undoubtedly meet Hitler and with a samurai sword, I<br/>
would either kill him or make him commit seppuku. Some of you might frown or<br/>

<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1062370272">Hi,my choice is Saika Magoichi.Probably some of members here know him.<br/>
<br/>
He was the leader of Saika army, which has lots of firepower and <br/>
helped Honganji temple through the battles with Nobunaga.He was a <br/>
mysteryous person,whose real name is not sure.But many say Suzuki <br/>
Shigehide or his brother Shigetomo is him.Many kagemusha of him seems <br/>
to have existed.Saika army is said to be some kind of ninja.They have <br/>
many tanegashima and experienced riflemen.Nobunaga had the hardest <br/>
time in the battled with them.<br/>
<br/>
I don't think all of the tactics in the battle of Nagashino are <br/>
Nobunaga's invention.Probably he was inspired a lot by the tactics of <br/>
Saika.<br/>
<br/>
After the ceasefire between Nobunaga and Honganji,Saika kept on <br/>
fighting with Nobunaga.And after Nobunaga's death, they still battled <br/>
with Hideyoshi. <br/>
Though Saika surrenderd to Hideyoshi's massive power,he was higly <br/>
evaluated as a commander and rifleman.He became a retainer of <br/>
Toyotomi Hidenaga,Hideyoshi's brother.<br/>
<br/>
And after Ieyasu took power,he hired Saika as a riflemaster of <br/>
shogunate.<br/>
<br/>
The fact he survived shows what an excelent military man he was! <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
  In addition to him, here is my list;<br/>
<br/>
Kusunoki masashige,Sanada Yukimura(I am an Osaka resident.They are <br/>
the Heroes of Osaka),Hideyoshi(By the time he united Japan),Uesugi <br/>
Kenshin, Takenaka Hanbei,Date Masamune,Minamoto no Tametomo,Tachibana <br/>
Dousetsu, Tachibana Muneshige, Maeda Keijirou</div>

The answer is no again.  I'd have to lie, cheat, and steal (E.G. <br/>
Modern Military assets at my disposal but not at thiers).  Then <br/>
and only then would I even stand a glimmer of hope.  Maybe I'm  <br/>
just a retard but I wouldn't even be able to keep my cool ..I'd <br/>
probably pull a Katsuyori. :P<br/>

Hi <br/>
<br/>
Yeah I too would love to challenge Sun-Tzu or Nobunaga to a game of <br/>
chess or Total war, I think Sun-Tzu would feel more at home with <br/>
Romance of the Kingdoms series, and Nobunaga with Nobunaga's ambition <br/>
by Koei though (more realistic sorry EA). <br/>
<br/>
     I love Shogun Total war but Now after I think 3 years ofplaying  <br/>
I am wanting more from the ronin clans (not in history but anyway), I <br/>
notice in the latest version they have the Mogami, Date, Ouchi, <br/>
Miyoshi etc the list goes on, I think they should use the maps from <br/>
www.Samurai-archives as these are by far the best maps I have seen in <br/>
a long time, except maybe from the Cambridge classical history of <br/>
Japan, but these cost £80 a shot and I'm only a Daimyo of about 3 <br/>
koku. But I have an armoury yeyyy and one spear Dojo, arrgghh the <br/>
ikko-iki already. <br/>
<br/>
    Anyway now for something completly different, back to the <br/>
question I would like to play chess with these guys but not Shogi <br/>
(Japanese Chess) or Chinese chess xiangQi.  Has anyone out there <br/>
played it, very complicated, you sometimes can't move your pieces <br/>
backwards (Very Bushido me thinks) allthough the names of the pieces <br/>
in Kanji are fantastic Drunk Elephant, Treacherous fox, strutting <br/>
crow, (This is shogi historical variants quoted from many games  ;)  <br/>
<br/>
    When I saw Crouching tiger Hidden Dragon I really found the names <br/>
fascinating this goes one step beyond, surely madness you might <br/>
think, but it really works.  I urge everyone to check out <br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.the-underdogs.org/game.php?name=Shogi+Variants">http://www.the-underdogs.org/game.php?name=Shogi+Variants</a> it has a <br/>
copy of Shogi variants with shogi from each period, historically <br/>
relevant, to Japan from the <br/>
Heian period through Sengoku, Monoyama, Meiji, Modern.  Awesome, also <br/>
if not get international Karate and sumo Hoppers, both Classics, very <br/>
old school.  <br/>
<br/>
    But seriously Shogi is fantastic, and it can help you get into <br/>
the mind set of a warrior of these days, as they would have played <br/>
this or Go as a strategic exercise.  Check out Mr A.J Bryant's cool <br/>
site at www.geocities.com/sengokudaimyo/miscellany/miscellany.html to <br/>
find out more.  On a last note, I personally see Nobunaga as a <br/>
brutish, boring, unispiring leader, Akechi Mitsuhide on the other <br/>
hand he sounds cool, why did he kill Nobunaga, (I think I would have <br/>
done the same maybe I have a ruthless streak??!!(^_^)*** Nobunaga <br/>
wanted to become King so to speak Akechi he was just a pawn, <br/>
sometimes, pawns take kings, (Shogi again) Just look at Hideyoshi now <br/>
theres a Maneki Neko (Lucky cat) I would have liked to have known and <br/>
fought beside.<br/>
<br/>
Again check out Shogi I'm sure you will find it useful, if only for <br/>
the history, I really enjoy it, except you sometimes can't move <br/>
backwards, this would never work in Total war as how the ##### do I <br/>
take a bridge province using 1 unit of Spearmen without fake <br/>
retreating.  XiangQi Chinese chess has a river through the middle of <br/>
the board maybe I should study this a bit more.  <br/>
<br/>
All the best Mark</div>
