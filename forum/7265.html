Koyamada<br/>

<br/>
Father and Son Warriors in "The Last Samurai"<br/>
In "The Last Samurai," Ken Watanabe plays Katsumoto, the leader of <br/>
the samurai who first captures then befriends Tom Cruise's <br/>
character, Captain Nathan Algren. Shin Koyamada co-stars as <br/>
Katsumoto's son, Nobutada, a skilled young samurai who takes an <br/>
immediate liking to Algren and teaches him the ways of Japan.<br/>
Catching up with the two stars at the US Premiere of "The Last <br/>
Samurai," I had an opportunity to ask each about their work on this <br/>
big budget American film.<br/>
<br/>
KEN WATANABE ('Katsumoto'):<br/>
<br/>
How difficult was the language barrier when you were working?<br/>
At first it was so difficult. The dialogue [took much] practice, and <br/>
[much] practice of pronunciation. <br/>
<br/>
I understood the meaning, so it was it was very comfortable. But <br/>
conversation, I want to more deep feeling and more deep stories. I <br/>
want to talk with Ed [Zwick] and Tom [Cruise] and it's so difficult. <br/>
It was step by step.<br/>
Did you have a translator on the set when you were working?<br/>
Yes. In very sensitive scenes, I had to have correct meaning. I used <br/>
a translator to understand and act.<br/>
<br/>
What was your most difficult scene to film?<br/>
The cherry blossoms. Three days of shooting and oh my God! It's a <br/>
terrible schedule.<br/>
<br/>
SHIN KOYAMADA ('Nobutada'):<br/>
<br/>
Can you tell me a little about your role in "The Last Samurai?"<br/>
I play the young samurai Nobutada who befriends captured American <br/>
soldier, played by Tom Cruise. My father, the leader samurai, <br/>
advises me to teach Tom's character in the Japanese way Â– Japanese <br/>
culture and Japanese language.<br/>
<br/>
Your character's also an expert with bow and arrows. Did you train <br/>
or were you already familiar with archery?<br/>
I had to spend most of my time training Japanese archery and <br/>
horseback riding since the movie was starting. I even paid to <br/>
practice on my days off (laughing).<br/>
<br/>
How difficult was it to learn the bow?<br/>
Japanese archery is not actually a sport. Martial arts, it is kind <br/>
of like mediation. So you had to learn mentally and it took me <br/>
awhile to understand Japanese archery itself. <br/>
<br/>
What do you think about the way the samurai lifestyle is portrayed?<br/>
This is THE movie where you can learn about samurai (laughing).<br/>
<br/>
You had a lot of action in this movie. What was the most difficult <br/>
stunt for you to do?<br/>
I had to shoot the arrows on horseback. It takes usually 10 years to <br/>
do that. I had to it for seven months to learn it. I killed myself <br/>
learning [so as] not to be embarrassed to show Japanese people, <br/>
respectfully.<br/>
