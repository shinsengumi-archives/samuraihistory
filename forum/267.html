<h3>Unarmed Samurai?</h3>
by <i>S. Lyle Parker</i>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1757526199">Dear Fred,<br/>
<br/>
Very interesting discussion that you have started.  Don't have the resources <br/>
at hand as I am new to Japan and have not overcome the many (mostly <br/>
monetary) obstacles to internet access as yet.  Therefore I am consigned to <br/>
a crowded (albeit free) internet cafe.<br/>
<br/>
In any event, I believe that your instincts based on the information that <br/>
you have found -- or more rightly not found -- regarding samurai unarmed <br/>
combat training is on mark.  You make an excellent judgement in using the <br/>
ashigaru as an example.  Whenever we talk about warriors in Japan it <br/>
behooves us to make a distinction between the different social levels.  The <br/>
everyday experience of the elite warriors (those holding court rank) and <br/>
those in the lower echelons could not have been more different.<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>This seems to have been true on the mass scale at least insofar as the <br/>
Sengoku period is concerned.  Things during the Tokugawa era are a bit <br/>
different, however.  In _Armed Martial Arts of Japan_, G. Cameron Hurst <br/>
notes that in the Tokugawa era we see the incorporation of separate schools <br/>
of combat.  That is, we see "masters" hanging  out a shingle advertising <br/>
that they were teaching, for example, naginata skills.  This became <br/>
increasingly important as the warriors, separated from their historical <br/>
professions by the peace engendered under the Tokugawa regime, needed to <br/>
find a way to make a living.  There were only so many opportunities to act <br/>
as police or other government sanctioned positions.  A warrior who received <br/>
a certificate of transmission from a well-known sword (or other) master <br/>
could then hang out his own shingle and ply his trade as a teacher of that <br/>
school (or its offshoot).  In Hurst's book is also a detailed treatment of <br/>
the development of the ryuha system, primarily in the early 17th century.  <br/>
As in most eras of Japanese history, name and lineage were of vital <br/>
importance to martial arts practitioners, be they armed or unarmed, and as <br/>
such well-known masters were sought after.  By way of example, in John <br/>
Rogers' partial translation of the _Honcho Bugei Shoden_ which appeared in <br/>
Monumenta Nipponica mention is made of one Ishido Chikurin who became the <br/>
founder of the Chikurin "ha" of the Heki-ryu lineage of Kyudo.  He became <br/>
famous for having won a tooshiya "long-range shooting contest" at <br/>
Sanjusangendo and subsequently was employed as archery teacher to (if memory <br/>
serves) either Hideyoshi or Ieyasu.  <-- I'll check on this when I get <br/>
home...<br/>
<br/>
But I digress...  As regards unarmed combat, I also am fairly curious as to <br/>
the percentages of samurai (of whichever social stratum) that practiced such <br/>
things (either doing the Sengoku or later through to 1800 or so).  One place <br/>
to start a search may be to look into the concept of bugei juhappan.  These <br/>
were said to be the 18 important skills of a warrior.  I am not sure when <br/>
the term became current, but one place to look may be Karl Friday's _Legacy <br/>
of the Sword_ which is an outstanding look at a "complete" warrior system.  <br/>
Rather than teaching, say, just iaido, their training encompasses many <br/>
different skills and, again if memory serves, unarmed skills.<br/>
<br/>
Just a few thoughts.<br/>

Indirectly on topic, but a question/comment nonetheless. . . In all<br/>
my years of reading and studying Japanese Samurai history, I have<br/>
NEVER come accross anything even remotely resembling 'a group of<br/>
samurai practicing karate together in a dojo' (quote is my own). I<br/>
have never seen any references to unarmed combat training, and don't<br/>
see much use for it anyway. The samurai studied weapons, which is<br/>
common sense, of course. I don't believe (and this is opinion) that<br/>
even 'powerful samurai families' employed 'martial artists' to teach<br/>
them unarmed combat. from my limited (6 years of martial arts<br/>
training about 10 years ago or so - and my studying of martial arts<br/>
history) is that unarmed combat originated in Okinawa, and at best<br/>
200 - 300 years ago. I'm sure that judo or jujitsu-like 'wrestling'<br/>
probably existed, but I doubt that Takeda Shingen or Oda Nobunaga<br/>
hired martial arts experts to train there armies in the way of<br/>
unarmed combat. I would hazzard to guess based on what I've read<br/>
(and thus on what I 'haven't' come accross) that mass training for<br/>
the armies wasn't too common - even weapons training. most ashigaru<br/>
probably went out and cut themselves a bamboo spear and just charged<br/>
into battle hoping for the best. I would assume that any martial<br/>
training with weapons was done on one's own, and not through<br/>
a 'teacher' exept for perhaps the 'richest' or closest to the lord,<br/>
who would receive sword training. Anyway, my point is that I've<br/>
never seen ANYTHING regarding maritial arts training in<br/>
the 'scholarly' Japanese history books. At best the subject comes up<br/>
in the VERY questionable 'martial arts history books'. If someone<br/>
has info on martial arts training from a 'reputable source' PLEASE<br/>
respond to this post. I am curious about this simply because it is<br/>
not something covered by Hall, Varley, Sansom, Berry, or the others.<br/>
