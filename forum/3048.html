<h3>Modern Day Sword Training?</h3>
by <i>BMCAMP@aol.com</i>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-641715366">Hello to all,<br/>
<br/>
I am new to the group, but find the Samurai interesting and am reading <br/>
everything I can.  My question has to do with modern studies of the Samurai <br/>
techniques of swordmanship.  I have seen a few books about it, and even heard that Tom <br/>
Cruise studied with a group out of New York City.  I would like to know where <br/>
I could possibly learn the techniques learned by the Samurai.  I have not <br/>
seen any Kendo teachers in my area.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks,<br/>
<br/>
Brett<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-263330827">There are Kendo groups in various parts of the country, (none near me), but depending upon where you are there may be some. Be prepared to spend several hundred dollars on equipment and lessons. A simple web search for 'Kendo' should find you a few sites that have links to dojos around the country. <br/>
