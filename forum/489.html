The Kaga was originally launched as a battleship in 1926, and so was named<br/>
after a province like the other battleships. She wasn't modified into a<br/>
carrier till 1935. The Akagi was also originally built as a battle cruiser<br/>
and converted to a CV, so her name isn't consistent with Japanese CV names.<br/>
<br/>
The "ryû" was common in CVs; it means "dragon." Other common elements in CV<br/>
names were "kaku" (crane), "hô" (phoenix), and "shô" (soar).<br/>
<br/>
Sôryu is "blue dragon"; Hiryû is "flying dragon"; Shôkaku is "soaring<br/>
crane"; Shôhô is "soaring phoenix"; Zuikaku is "felicitous crane."<br/>
