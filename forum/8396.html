 </span></blockquote>From what I understand Benkei's entire character is considered a legend.<br/>
I'd have to look back through the introduction to McCullough's<br/>
translation of the Yoshitsune legend but I'm fairly certain this is the<br/>
case. I remember reading once that Yoshitsune did have a monk companion<br/>
so this is probably where the legend grew from, as most of the people<br/>
(real or not) in Yoshitsune's party had their characters fleshed out by<br/>
later stories.<br/>
