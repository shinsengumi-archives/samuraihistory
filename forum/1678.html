<h3>Nagato 1550</h3>

<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-984837861">Greetings, <br/>
<br/>
I'm working on a project concerning the Ouchi-Mori conflict starting about <br/>
1550, a year before Ouchi Yoshitaka was deposed by Sue Harukata. I'm <br/>
really interested in some pretty specific information, any references <br/>
would be much appreciated: <br/>
<br/>
The town of Hagi: Anyone know of a good resource on this town before the <br/>
Mori clan took over the area? I know a castle was built there after Mori <br/>
took control and that it was a center for fine pottery much later. I've <br/>
parsed all the official websites concerning Hagi, I think, but what I'm <br/>
really looking for is a detailed map, preferably topographical, and <br/>
information on the minor daimyo that controlled that area and any of the <br/>
outlying areas of Nagato. <br/>
<br/>
Any information on Yamaguchi while Yoshitaka kept court there. Maps <br/>
preferably. I found a great resource detailing Francis Xavier's time in <br/>
Yamaguchi (he actually left only a few weeks before Yoshitaka was <br/>
overthrown). It had some specific info on Yamaguchi, but really need more <br/>
detail on the city in that era. <br/>
<br/>
I am aware of the work by Arnesen concerning the Ouchi rule of Nagato and <br/>
Suo, but I haven't trucked down to the library to peruse that. I've gotten <br/>
some information from that work through a third party, however. I have a <br/>
few of the Turnbull samurai books that shed a little light on that <br/>
situation as well. I also have parsed websites detailing the Mori clans <br/>
activities before and after Yoshitaka's fall, the few sites concerning <br/>
Harukata and some other general information. I guess I'm really looking <br/>
mostly for obscure political information on that area and physical <br/>
information on the land and towns. <br/>
<br/>
Anyway. Anything you have, online preferably. Much appreciated. <br/>

I am not at all aware of any maps or info of Hagi in 1550, but you may be<br/>
interested in a very good article in a "National Geographic" issue of quite some<br/>
years ago about Hagi in the Bakumatsu period.  I recall a map of that time was<br/>
also in the article.  I do have the particular issue in my archives but it would<br/>
take me some time to find it!!  You may be rewarded by searching the National<br/>
Geographic site for HAGI and also YOSHIDA SHOIN, who features prominently in the<br/>
article if I remember correctly.  Also MORI as the Mori castle was pictured - or<br/>
rather, its ruined foundations after it was burnt on the Daimyo's orders after<br/>
the Meiji Restoration.<br/>
<br/>
Finally, if reference cannot be found please get back to me - offlist or<br/>
onlist - and I'll search for the issue.<br/>
<br/>
Best regards,<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>There is quite a good website on Yamaguchi Prefecture in Japanese and English <br/>

<br/>
with several references to the Ouchi. Again, this may not be in the depth you are looking for.<br/>
<br/>
I've seen maps of Hagi from the late 18th and mid 19th century, but nothing earlier. I've got a (not very good) photo of one from about 1850, from the Takasugi Shinsaku museum near Shimonoseki.<br/>
<br/>
I was in Yamaguchi prefecture for three months last year and spent quite a lot of time in both Hagi and Yamaguchi, visiting some of the Ouchi sites, but my main interest was in the bakumatsu period. But if you want any other information about the landscape, seasons etc, let me know.<br/>
<br/>
The Ouchi are a fascinating clan and Yamaguchi in their era must have been a vibrant and interesting place.<br/>
