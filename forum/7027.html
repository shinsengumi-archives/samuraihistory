<h3>Geiko in Kyoto</h3>

<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-327675419">"True enough about "Geisha" not being used in Kyoto. <br/>
And of course you never actually *SEE* any-"<br/>
Actually, there's quite a few Geiko in Kyoto to see.<br/>
As they don't wear the bright elaborate kimono and<br/>
face paint that a Maiko does, they just don't usually<br/>
get noticed. Almost every time I get on a bus during<br/>
the evening that crosses over the Kamo, there seems to<br/>
be a Geiko on it. I never would have known it if my<br/>
mother-in-law had not pointed them out.<br/>
And if you lurk near the Gion area, you can see them<br/>
coming and going from the old teahouses. The Maiko are<br/>
just much more noticable and photogenic!<br/>
