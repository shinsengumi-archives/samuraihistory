<h3>Support the Samurai Archives</h3>
by <i>kitsuno</i>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1488789773">(Pardon the 'shameless plug' in advance...)<br/>
As I'm sure everyone here can attest to, due to the recent movie "The <br/>
Last Samurai", interest in the Samurai has skyrocketed.  That has <br/>
meant, among other things, that the amount of hits per day has <br/>
tripled and the number of hits per month is approaching 50,000!<br/>
What does this mean? It means that we have had to increase traffic <br/>
limits yet further, which has increased the fees (Delphi forum fees <br/>
are also included), so we've instated something we hope everyone will <br/>
find interesting:<br/>

<br/>
For anyone interested in helping with the cost of the server, we've <br/>
implemented donations via PayPal.  All donations are tracked on the <br/>
above 'donations' page, and rank and Sengoku biographies are bestowed <br/>
on all who donate.  Any amount at all helps.  We're still in the <br/>
process of tweaking the ranks, titles, and bios, but I think you see <br/>
the basic idea.  <br/>
<br/>
For anyone who can't part with any actual cash, we highly encourage <br/>
submissions to assist us in constantly upgrading the page.  Anything <br/>
from desktop wallpapers to research projects are accepted - take a <br/>
look at the 'featured articles' section to see past submissions.  <br/>
<br/>
Also, don't forget to check the Samurai Archives store as well. There <br/>
might be something there worth picking up as well.<br/>

and KOTOSHI MO YOROSHIKU ONEGAI SHIMASU!<br/>
