<h3>koumitsushi question again for Shinsei</h3>
by <i>wahmeister</i>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-842150573">If "Sensei Shinsei" is here..........,<br/>
   How are things going?<br/>
 I have been wanting to write and ask another question about <br/>
Masamune if posssible.<br/>
  <br/>
   I owe a great deal to you for helping me with the name <br/>
Koumitsushi/Masamune. <br/>
   I have been searching the web and there is only one other place I <br/>
can find that says Goro Nyudo Koumitsushi was the great Masamune. <br/>
Personally, I have no doubt that he was, but do you know if there are <br/>
any history books that are available that has this information in it? <br/>
In Japanese or English. <br/>
  Thank You, LB</div>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-2087532744">Hi,I had read an article about Masamune before in some Japanese <br/>
history magazine,Rekishi Dokuhon or so.But I forget where it was <br/>
exactly.<br/>
<br/>
When you asked who was Koumitsushi,I confirmed in some Japanese <br/>
webpages Several pages said Masamune was the son of Yukimitsu<br/>
(Koumitsu) as I had known.<br/>
The theory is the most probable,I think,but some says Yukimitsu was <br/>
not Masamune's father and it is true the example of the name <br/>
Koumitsushi was rare.it was usual for Masamune not to carve his name <br/>
in the swords he made.<br/>
<br/>
I think there must be many books in Japanese that include Masamune <br/>
story,but I don't know their particular names,sorry.<br/>
<br/>
Regards<br/>

Shinsei<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>"KOUMITSU-SHI" means "Son of Yukimitsu".<br/>
(Masamune's father was Tohzaburou-Yukimitsu).<br/>
Yukimitsu is another  pronunciation for charactors "KOUMITSU".<br/>
