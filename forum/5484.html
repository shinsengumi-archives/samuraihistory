 </span></blockquote>Yoshiaki was more of a hindrance than a help to anyone<br/>
he colluded with. And didn't he eventually kill<br/>
Matsunaga? I seem to remember something about him<br/>
smashing an important tea bowl to prevent it falling<br/>
into Oda hands as his castle burned around him. <br/>

 </span></blockquote>Doesnt change the fact that he built up quite a coalition against <br/>
Nobunaga, who is not known for his charity or amnesty :P<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Exactly - after he fled kyoto and had time to become a problem for <br/>
Nobunaga.  In both cases, it just seems odd that Nobunaga would just <br/>
let them escape.</div>

 </span></blockquote>You know, I could be wrong, but I think he actually filled the tea <br/>
bowl with gunpowder and used it to both destroy the bowl and to blow <br/>
his own head off so that Nobunaga couldnt have either.</div>
