<h3>Women walking behind men</h3>
by <i>Scott19NY</i>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-171310053">Although I will admit the idea of a woman walking behind a man more <br/>
then likely had more to do with his status and/or gender than with <br/>
protecting the woman.  However, in the West there is still a tendancy <br/>
(although not always, and it seems to be decling slowly) for men, <br/>
even when walking side by side with a woman, to walk on the side that <br/>
the road is on.  There may be others, but the explaination that I <br/>
have heard for this social phenomenea stems from the time in which <br/>
horses were used, and could easily go off the street and cause <br/>
serious injury or death.  So there is a possiblity of some form of <br/>
protection with women walking a step behind a man (please don't flame <br/>
me feminists :D).</div>
