<h3>Maps of the Sengoku Jidai</h3>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-684310287">Hi everyone,<br/>
<br/>
I was wondering if anyone knows of a good source(s) for maps from the Sengoku Jidai.  In particular, locations of battles, castles, temples, and other significant sites.<br/>
<br/>
Samurai Archives has a number of decent maps, but I am looking for other sources too.  Books, websites, etc...<br/>
<br/>
One thing I have noticed is that if you look at multiple sources you often get multiple (slightly different) accounts of stories or locations/names.  So, I am trying to broaden my sources.<br/>
For example, there is a map from Turnbull documenting Hojo expansion in the Kanto, and it really isn't clear if he is being overly generous or not since he "gives" them the Satomi domain prior to the final siege of Odawara.<br/>
<br/>
Also, I would be okay with looking at maps in japanese, if anyone knows of some good ones.  My Japanese is not great, but I can usually do enough translation on individual words/terms/places to get the gist.<br/>
<br/>
Anyways, thanks in advance.<br/>
