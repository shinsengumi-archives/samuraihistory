<div id="ygrps-yiv-45654294">Hi. I found the Samurai pages through my Sensei's web page link, and <br/>
before this, I didn't know people studied the Samurai and Japanese <br/>
history with such enthusiasm. It's an eye opener for me. :-) Good to <br/>
have one's eyes opened. <br/>
My name is Sharon Hayakawa, aka Shuri Hayakawa. I live in Missouri, <br/>
USA. My Sensei is Doshu Shiro Shintaku from Wakayama Japan. <br/>
Before studying with him, I studied with Seiyu Oyata. About 17 years <br/>
or so. <br/>
Hajimemashite.</div>
