<br/>
All the research (which ain't much) I have done suggests that boy's didn't wear swords. They had there<br/>
Genpuku thus were<br/>
adults and strapped on an adult sword. in the Edo period young boys may have worn a tanto if they were<br/>
of a good family<br/>
but didn't wear swords in public until their coming of age.<br/>
    The swords we see in tachi mounts made by well known names are actually kazari tachi. Light elegant<br/>
sometimes flashy<br/>
little blades for courtiers or for ceremonial. NOT for boys but for adults who needed to wear a sword but<br/>
didn't need to<br/>
lug around a 3 shaku nambokucho blade to attend some eight hour paper wasting ceremony (still<br/>
popular today).<br/>
    Does anyone have evidence or reference to how we came to call these boys' swords or boy's day<br/>
swords? Is there<br/>
somewhere definitive scholarship on what boys wore, if anything?<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-64409164">According to "Secrets of the Samurai" (Tuttle, 1973 or Castle <br/>
books, 1999) by Oscar Ratti and Adele Westbrook, "There were <br/>
2 major turning points in th life of a child born (or adopted) into <br/>
the buke.  The first was the introductory ceremony in which he <br/>
was given his first sword, the mamori-gatana, "a charm sword <br/>
with a hilt and scabbard covered with brocade, to which was <br/>
attached to a kinchaku (purse or wallet)... worn by boys under 5 <br/>
years of age" (Stone, 433).  The second ceremony was the <br/>
gembuku, which signified his acceptance as a man amoung <br/>
men.  At this time the child recieved his first real swords and <br/>
armor and had his hair dressed in an adult coiffure.  From this <br/>
point of his life onward, he would be expected to specialize in the <br/>
functions typical of his rank within the heirarchy of the clan, but <br/>
without ever neglecting his training in the art of using the <br/>
weapon that had been defined in the military code as the "living <br/>
soul of the samurai.""<br/>
Just read that the other day.  Found it interesting that the "charm <br/>
swords" were called mamori-gatana.  Could almost mistake that <br/>
pheonetically for english of similar meaning.  Some bearing on <br/>
your boy's day sword question I think.<br/>

    remember mamori-gatana (in different koshirae)were also given to young<br/>
brides where they would undoubtebly be worn much closer to the mamori ;-)<br/>
