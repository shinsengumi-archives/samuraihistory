<br/>
Which term was most commonly used by the people of that time to describe<br/>
the warrior class in the 16th century forward, bushi or samurai? Were<br/>
they essentially interchangable? Why has samurai become the most<br/>
commonly used term these days, when most of the history books I have use<br/>
the term bushi, and you'd think with all the nonsense out there about<br/>
bushido that bushi would be the one people would be most familiar with?<br/>
Does samurai simply sound "cooler" and more Japanese?<br/>
<br/>
Thanks, <br/>
Angus<br/>

Hi there:<br/>
<br/>
I've got a question. I know that after Hideyoshi Toyotomi died in <br/>
1598 his son took command but then quickly lost it to Ieyasu <br/>
Tokugawa. I've learned that Osaka castle, which was Hideyoshi's <br/>
headquarters, was destroyed by Tokugawa. Now my question here is how <br/>
was it destroyed was it burned to the ground? Oh yeah one more thing <br/>
how did Hideyoshi die was he murdered or did he die of natural <br/>
causes?<br/>
<br/>
Thanks everybody,<br/>
