Kyoto is a city of contrasts. People in bullet trains busy with <br/>
gizmos, arriving at centuries-old temples and queueing up for <br/>
wisdom. And, there is no off season <br/>

<br/>
Nobody visiting Japan for the first time can deny it is different <br/>
from any other travel experience. To start with, it is difficult to <br/>
reconcile with the extremes - here are the world's most progressive <br/>
people with every gadget possible from different temperatures for <br/>
toilet seats to radical designers, juxtaposed into family life and <br/>
customs four centuries old. <br/>
<br/>
Nature to the Japanese is a close companion; affable and calming <br/>
rather than grandiose and detached. And nowhere is this more <br/>
apparent than in Kyoto, that Edmund Blunden called the "temple of <br/>
all the earth's towns," a part of the global lexicon, thanks to the <br/>
Kyoto Protocol signed in 1997. <br/>
<br/>
There's so little known about the other Kyoto that Jan Morris <br/>
describes, "remains to the Japanese something special... the supreme <br/>
repository of their ancient traditions, their religion, and their <br/>
high-flown patriotism, their golden heritage and their resilient <br/>
pride." <br/>
<br/>
Take Kyo-kaori (meaning Kyoto fragrance or flavor), a bottled iced <br/>
tea with powdered matcha tea from Kyoto, concealed in a clever <br/>
double cap. The bottle contains only water, but when you unscrew the <br/>
top cap, it releases the powdered tea from the green tube into the <br/>
water as you taste the flavours of Kyoto from an odd-coloured green <br/>
bottle! <br/>
<br/>
For a more conventional experience, Kyoto's sights and sounds can <br/>
best be explored by foot. Its mass of cool green garden moss, an oft <br/>
resounding echo of a temple bell, the inimitable aroma of soy, sugar <br/>
and sake, and the sensual caress of silk, can all be taken in on a <br/>
day's walk. An over 1200-year-old city, this is a city of 1,600 <br/>
temples and 400 shrines and palaces and gardens. <br/>
<br/>
One thing Kyoto does not have is an off season. In spring and <br/>
autumn, the Japanese flock to see the famed cherry blossoms in <br/>
Maruyama Park and the maple leaves in the western hills of <br/>
Arashiyama. In summer, the city is ablaze with colour, with the <br/>
gilded, ornate floats of the July 17 Gion Matsuri, then with the <br/>
Daimonji, when a gargantuan bonfire paints the character "dai," <br/>
or "big," against the eastern mountain slope. <br/>
<br/>
There's so much of India in Kyoto's temples with numerous <br/>
manifestations of Buddha. The ten or tembu, originally Indian deva, <br/>
Hindu deities, were incorporated into the Buddhist faith and became <br/>
its protectors, have their imposing images often flanking temple <br/>
entrances. The smell of delicate incense in everywhere. <br/>
<br/>
A popular attraction is the 14th century, Kinkakuii, completely <br/>
covered in gold leaf, earning it the name Golden Pavilion. Here in <br/>
1984, explains the guide, water from the holy Ganges was brought and <br/>
stored. <br/>
<br/>
Meanwhile at the world heritage site, Nijo Castle, the finely <br/>
wrought parquet floors of the outer rooms squeak loudly when trod <br/>
upon, bearing an uncanny resemblance to the song of the nightingale. <br/>
No mere structural quirk, the squeaks were designed into the floor <br/>
as a warning system for the shogun, Tokugawa Iyeyasu, who built the <br/>
castle in 1603 and lived there in continual fear of would-be <br/>
assassins, despite the stone walls and moats that surrounded it. <br/>
<br/>
At the 'Pure water temple', Kiyomizudera, associated with Nara <br/>
Buddhism, the oldest sect in Japan, visitors can choose from three <br/>
streams that guarantee you one of the three - health, wealth or <br/>
wisdom. Interestingly, one sees long queues of Japanese students <br/>
opting for the wisdom spring - a direct connotation of their <br/>
cultural upbringing. <br/>
<br/>
The approach to the temple along Kiyomizu-michi or Gojo-zaka is <br/>
steep and narrow, the streets lined with stores specialising in <br/>
local sweets and souvenirs including fans, teapots and ceramic frogs <br/>
that promise to bring prosperity. From the terrace of the temple, is <br/>
beautiful view of the wooded hills of eastern Kyoto. <br/>
<br/>
Here, walking among the Zen gardens that try to convince belief in <br/>
emptiness, actually allows the mind to stop. Be it a solitary stone <br/>
in a rock garden or a stray red maple leaf just fallen on carefully <br/>
raked sand, everything seems to have it's carefully designated <br/>
place. <br/>
<br/>
It isn't long before one finds oneself back into the humdrum of <br/>
daily life in Kyoto station, catching the bullet train to Nagoya. In <br/>
all this madness, strange how one has caught up perhaps for the <br/>
first time, with the fullness of life in all its forms.</div>
