a wide variety of culture and material goods. Sounds pretty 'bad' to me. <br/>
Their government might not be as corrupt as the US nowadays.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>And I think that couldn't be further from the truth. I'll admit I know<br/>
next to nothing about the various schools of swordsmanship--nor do I<br/>
really have an interest in learning--but there is an awful lot more<br/>
involved in governing a country than swinging around a sharpened piece<br/>
of steel.<br/>
 <br/>
The Tokugawa bakufu lasted as long as it did because of the methods<br/>
introduced early on in regards to controlling the clans and the<br/>
strategic position of lands that were under direct bakufu control. These<br/>
were the reasons that it lasted as long as it did despite it's many<br/>
problems.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1380499142">I am not a huge expert on the Tokugawa era, but from what I have read  <br/>
on the subject, it seems that the regime survived more thanks to some  <br/>
of its suppressing laws.<br/>
for example peasants not being allowed to leave their land,<br/>
daimyos having to spend long periods of time in Edo and having to  <br/>
leave their families as "hostages" while they were away.<br/>
<br/>
Therefore it was very hard to organize any kind of opposition, and  <br/>
every section of society was kept under control.<br/>

expediency, a desire to secure and remain in power,<br/>
socioeconomic factors, etc. Tokugawa Ieyasu was not<br/>
some mystical warrior-monk who ran out and did a sword<br/>
kata every time he had to make some critical political<br/>
decision. If anything, he was the ultimate pragmatist.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Spoken like you subscribe to "Martial Arts<br/>
Illustrated". Look, I'm not saying that martial arts<br/>
experience wouldn't have aided a decision or two, but<br/>
it's ridiculous to say that Shinkage-ryu, or any<br/>
martial art, was the basis of the Tokugawa political<br/>
construct. Inspired politician, great leader, and good<br/>
general--Tokugawa was all of these. Mystical martial<br/>
arts warrior king? Not so much. Considering at the end<br/>
of his life he was fairly fat, I'm not sure he did<br/>
much training beyond the "tempura-do" school. <br/>

 </span></blockquote>Definately. And "adapting" is something that the Japanese government,<br/>
shogunate, bakufu, or any other power group of ANY era has never been<br/>
good at. You almost never see change, just revolutions and power<br/>
grabs. In this brave new world of swords into plowshares, it will be<br/>
interesting to see how far the Japanese economy will have to fall<br/>
before either the country falls into third world status, or for the<br/>
government to reorganize and reform. Guns and swords wouldn't go over<br/>
well in this 'modern' world. But, most likely, Japan will continue to<br/>
simply flounder at the status quo for the next few decades. It seems<br/>
that no government in any country wants to change until it is a decade<br/>
or two into utter crisis. A pound of cure seems so much more<br/>
worthwhile than that ounce of prevention. Looking at it from the<br/>
perspective of history, it will be interesting to see how post-modern<br/>
revolutions in first world countries are conducted. 120 years ago,<br/>
when economies weren't tied together guns and steel could work, and<br/>
did work, they were the agents of change. Not specificaly 'samurai'<br/>
related, but interesting nonetheless.</div>

 </span></blockquote>No, they weren't--at least not nearly as much as by<br/>
expediency, a desire to secure and remain in power,<br/>
socioeconomic factors, etc. Tokugawa Ieyasu was not<br/>
some mystical warrior-monk who ran out and did a sword<br/>
kata every time he had to make some critical political<br/>
decision. If anything, he was the ultimate pragmatist.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Spoken like you subscribe to "Martial Arts<br/>
Illustrated". Look, I'm not saying that martial arts<br/>
experience wouldn't have aided a decision or two, but<br/>
it's ridiculous to say that Shinkage-ryu, or any<br/>
martial art, was the basis of the Tokugawa political<br/>
construct. Inspired politician, great leader, and good<br/>
general--Tokugawa was all of these. Mystical martial<br/>
arts warrior king? Not so much. Considering at the end<br/>
of his life he was fairly fat, I'm not sure he did<br/>
much training beyond the "tempura-do" school. <br/>

<br/>
3. Hey there's lots of money, land and power up for grabs locally if you have a good navy and army! <br/>

The Greater Asian Co-Prosperity Sphere starts 300 years early. Japan controls the Far East for all intents and purpose in the mid 1850s.<br/>

like Robin Hood and Little John. You will be overwhelmed with <br/>
websources. Ushiwakamaru works fairly well also. A quick peek shows some <br/>
reasonable sites near the top.<br/>
<br/>
Also since the Taiga drama that just finished is about them, anybody who <br/>
watches Japanese TV has probably heard of them.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1888202708">For the first time I have to agree with those aginst martial artest. To be frank Martial Arts as some one to day practices is now where near to what they where doing then. What most practice now is called sport art. It looks very simular but there is very lil simulatrities. I know this may hurt some of you MA buffs but do some research on the practices of ancient MA and then the governments. When looking at where a country came from you hear very little about MA. Like if you reviewed Japan or even China their histories where not shaped by MA but the best political moves or the best thought political moves by the leaders of the day. MA is a very deep part of these countries cultures but not what shaped their political views and moves.<br/>

expediency, a desire to secure and remain in power,<br/>
socioeconomic factors, etc. Tokugawa Ieyasu was not<br/>
some mystical warrior-monk who ran out and did a sword<br/>
kata every time he had to make some critical political<br/>
decision. If anything, he was the ultimate pragmatist.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Spoken like you subscribe to "Martial Arts<br/>
Illustrated". Look, I'm not saying that martial arts<br/>
experience wouldn't have aided a decision or two, but<br/>
it's ridiculous to say that Shinkage-ryu, or any<br/>
martial art, was the basis of the Tokugawa political<br/>
construct. Inspired politician, great leader, and good<br/>
general--Tokugawa was all of these. Mystical martial<br/>
arts warrior king? Not so much. Considering at the end<br/>
of his life he was fairly fat, I'm not sure he did<br/>
much training beyond the "tempura-do" school. <br/>
