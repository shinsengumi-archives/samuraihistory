<h3>Odawara and decline of Hojo family</h3>
by <i>samurai182uk</i>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1204902360">Hi there<br/>
<br/>
Thinking about that Odawara question has got me interested in the <br/>
question why did the Hojo clan fail and decline in 1590 A.D. The main <br/>
reasons I can think are that<br/>
<br/>
1. The constant warring of Hojo Ujiyasu against local clans such as <br/>
the Satake and Satomi undermined his position in the region by <br/>
fostering a relationship between him and other Daimyo that made them <br/>
turn to Oda and Tokugawa for support.<br/>
<br/>
2. Hojo Soun's establishment of the clan was based on poor <br/>
foundations, after all he claimed only tenuous links to ancient clan <br/>
traditions. Thus his band of followers were small.<br/>
<br/>
3. Hojo Ujiyasu had excellent organisational skills but when Hojo <br/>
Ujimasa took over he did not coordinate his forces as well as his <br/>
father did.<br/>
<br/>
4. The position of the Hojo in the Kanto region although relatively <br/>
guarded and rich was tennable, due to the Tokkaido roads and Hakone <br/>
mountain passes that led to the old capital at Kamakura. Also the <br/>
Hojo lacked naval strength as the other Western based clans had, such <br/>
as Kuki family who served Oda so effectively using the kumano Sui <br/>
navy. <br/>
<br/>
5. The battle of Kawagoe 1545 was at the time a victory, but I would <br/>
argue a pyrhic one, because by defeating the Uesugi, it only <br/>
harboured resentment enough to turn them against the Hojo and from <br/>
the North they blocked off retreat in the Odawara campaign.<br/>
<br/>
6. Uesugi Kagekatsu who was Hojo by birth but adopted by Kenshin, <br/>
supported the forces against Tokugawa, it could be argued that if he <br/>
remained on friendly terms, the Hojo and Uesugi could have formed a <br/>
reasonable alliance covering the Hakone mountains, and most of <br/>
Shinano, any attack would be costly and not so easily executed, <br/>
leaving the Hojo as Sparta did during the Sparta athenian war, to <br/>
concntrate on naval resources. Also Date family could have been asked <br/>
for support leading to a North vs South war perhaps. Although this is <br/>
highly unlikely because most clans were fighting against each other <br/>
and in particular the Satake and Satomi were already located in the <br/>
East of Hojo and would be a considerable thorn in the side.<br/>
<br/>
7. The quality of Hojo guns, As the allied forces apparently brought <br/>
Western cannon with them, but not siege cannon, they were only <br/>
capable apparently of setting fire to barricades. But never the less, <br/>
if Hojo attained a supply of guns from Sakai, or another major trade <br/>
port already under control by Oda or Tokugawa, then there ability to <br/>
last in a siege would be much greater. <br/>
<br/>
8. The Hojo should have looked further afield, there were many Daimyo <br/>
who didn't like Oda or Tokugawa, but most of Japan supported them, if <br/>
the Hojo had dug deeper they may have caused a Segikahara 10 years <br/>
earlier than it happened. Without Date and Maeda for suppport <br/>
Tokuugawa may not have become shogun, as Uesugi Kagekatsu perhaps <br/>
realised his mistake in also not supporting Hojo.<br/>
<br/>
9. The war against the Takeda perhaps put an end to Takeda but also <br/>
left them vulnerable with Tokugawa seizing vital territories namely <br/>
Kai and Shinano, with this seizure came the ability to turn the <br/>
mountin passes, leaving the columns of Tokugawa and Oda samurai to <br/>
march through.<br/>
<br/>
10. A pitched battle in the mountains? could it have turned the tide, <br/>
remeber Okehazama Nobunaga stopped Imagawa with approx 1/10 of his <br/>
force, could a force of say 5000 take on 50000 of Tokuagwa by <br/>
strategic blocking of passes and clever deception techniques. Maybe, <br/>
Hojo had a man for this Fuma Kotaro-the special forces leader, but <br/>
was he dead? But even if this had occured the Hojo were still in dire <br/>
straits.<br/>
<br/>
11.The Satake and Satomi clans, did not support Hojo. With support by <br/>
these clans supply routes could have been kept open, likewise goes to <br/>
Yuki Harumoto who choose to side with Tokuagwa. With Yuki's support <br/>
Hojo could have lasted alot longer, Odawara was a fortress effort had <br/>
been made to strengthen it.<br/>
<br/>
12. Toyotomi Hideyoshi- It can't be denied that Toyotomi HIdeyoshi <br/>
was a great general. He apparently managed to build a castle under <br/>
the nose of the Odawara defenders, I think although it would have <br/>
been a morale shattering episode, it was more a case of Roman esque <br/>
siege tactics, because he enclosed Odawara in two lines of siege <br/>
works, then built his castle I think. <br/>
<br/>
13. Maybe the Odawara castle was not as strong as the Hojos thought, <br/>
because it had been sieged and burnt twice before 1561 Uesugi <br/>
Kagetora deputy kanrei, 1569 Takeda captured it but retreaded due to <br/>
famine.  <br/>
<br/>
14. Build walls, to link the castles, making one huge fortified area, <br/>
the Hojo let there sattelite castles fall one by one, perhaps it <br/>
could be argued that a policy, more like Athens when she built long <br/>
walls to protect her port the Pireaus. But the Hojo had no means of <br/>
sea supply anyway. I guess the Hojo were cut off. But they could have <br/>
fortiefied and linked their defenses better. Allowing key men like <br/>
Chiba Shigetane a better chance to make a lasting stand. <br/>
<br/>
15. Daidoji Masashige, could have offered another plan, what Im <br/>
unsure of,but to sit and wait was demoralizing for any army no matter <br/>
how small, it is said the best form of defence is attack, therefore <br/>
why not catch them off guard. But it would only prolong the <br/>
inevitable, but a small victory could have lifted the spirits and <br/>
maybe shown other daimyo that the two generals were not invincible. <br/>
<br/>
16. Negotiation, the Hojo constantly attempted to negotiate their <br/>
corner, no battle was really fought it was more like sitting round a  <br/>
table holding back the cards, i.e the Odawara-jo. Nobody wanted a <br/>
fight, Tokugawa and Hideyoshi would not be wise to fight, because the <br/>
North east was still to be subdued Date, Mogami, Hachisuka, AShina, <br/>
Hatakeyama some major daimyo still were left, the North East would be <br/>
mountainous and tough. therfore losses of 50% or more would put the <br/>
conquerors in a poor military situation. Hojo Ujimasa eventually paid <br/>
with his life, Hojo Ujinao became a monk then died of small pox, the <br/>
Hojo clan faded from the sengoku epoch. Why didn't one Hojo perhaps <br/>
Ujiteru flee North East to gain support, because he couldn't they <br/>
were samurai and thus waited to die. <br/>
<br/>
In conclusion perhaps the best outcome the Hojo could have hoped for <br/>
was to dent the enemy forces enough to make them hesitate showing <br/>
weakness so more time could be gained to strengthen their forts and <br/>
more allies could be gathered. But this never happened because a <br/>
siege was seen as the best way of holding ground, to negotiate <br/>
favourable terms. But the problem was Tokugawa and Hideyoshi had 200 <br/>
000 men, Hojo had 50000 ~ and this ratio of 4/1 could only be used to <br/>
the Hojos advantage, if they attacked single regiments at a time, <br/>
weakening each front until the cohesive strength became such that a <br/>
major breakout and encirclement could be attempted by their own <br/>
forces, perhaps using cavalry as an armoured fist. I only speculate <br/>
as in reality in history it never did happen, perhaps it was not <br/>
possible. Perhaps they ressigned themselves to fate. Seeing <br/>
HIdeyoshis new castle built apparently overnight at Ichiya. The <br/>
pretext to this war was the Hojos taking of Sanada castle at <br/>
Nukuramui (think Shinano) maybe if the Hojo could get the Sanada to <br/>
support them they would have increased the likely hood of having <br/>
better generals and more vetern troops. But anything the Hojo did of <br/>
this parremeter would be in the end a pyrhic victory. The Hojo did <br/>
not really stand a chance, its another sad chapter in the times of <br/>
Sengoku warfare, not even Gekokuji (low overcome high) but now the <br/>
Low overcome the High who used to be low and before never existed. <br/>
Because Hojo Soun brought the clan into existence on fragile <br/>
foundations, they never had all the right elements to become bakufu. <br/>
It is said if you build your house on poor foundations it will come <br/>
to no good; well in the Hojos case it was true. How sad how very sad. <br/>
<br/>
Anyone respond if you can think of any other reasons, its just my <br/>
opinion, thinking about the situation, because the facts are limited <br/>
it is difficult to understand the campaign in great and sufficient <br/>
detail. <br/>

<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-252372575">Hi Mark,<br/>
I just wanted to say that you have some good points<br/>
witht he Odawara campaign. but I wanted to add a<br/>
little. First, negptiations were going on between the<br/>
Toyotomi and Hojo for at least two years prior to<br/>
Hideyoshi's invasion of the Kanto. Ieyasu was a the<br/>
intermediary between the two as he was allied to both.<br/>
He had even sent relatives to live with Hojo. Ieyasu,<br/>
however aligned himself with Hideyoshi and urged the<br/>
Hojo to submit. They of course did not do that, though<br/>
Ujimasa had plenty of opportunity to do so.<br/>
<br/>
2; Given Hideyoshi's past conduct, Ujimasa may have<br/>
expected to remain in power even after a war.<br/>
Hideyoshi generally treated his defeated foes well,<br/>
leaving them in power in exchange for oaths of<br/>
allegiance (shimazu, chosokabe, mori, etc.). Once the<br/>
Hojo submitted, however, he confiscated all of their<br/>
lands, and installed Ieyasu in the Kanto. Hideyoshi<br/>
seems to have decided the fate of the Hojo well<br/>
beforehand. <br/>
It's also interesting that Hojo Ujimori eventually<br/>
received a fief in Kawachi. Not sure what happened to<br/>
him...<br/>
<br/>
3: this brings up the point of position. The Kanto is<br/>
well removed from the Kinai, and did not offer a good<br/>
position from which to gain control of the country.<br/>
That seems to be why Hideyoshi put Ieyasu there, he<br/>
didn't trust him. Of course, the Kanto is the most<br/>
productive region of Japan and I would imagine that<br/>
whoever controlled it could affect the rice market,<br/>
although I've never read anything about that...maybe<br/>
the rest of the nation produced enough.<br/>
<br/>
4: During the seige, lords came out of the north to<br/>
pledge allegience to Hideyoshi, including Date,<br/>
Utsunomiya and Satake, thus the Hojo were the last<br/>
holdouts. They must have seen that they could expect<br/>
no help.<br/>
<br/>
the way things turn out...! Soun would've been ticked!<br/>
<br/>

ps- thanks for the info on Tsutsui.<br/>

<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-622122564">HI again Joseph<br/>
<br/>
First you make good points also, I think I overlooked many issues at <br/>
first when I gave many of my reasons. The idea of negotiations <br/>
occuring 2 years to the campaign is sound, as it was probably the <br/>
HOjos best option, also it would have got Hideyoshi the Kanto without <br/>
major loss of life, this would have served his aims as the campaigns <br/>
in the North would be seen as being tough ones. Im not sure about <br/>
Ujimasa remaining in power after the war, as he was made to commit <br/>
Seppuku straight after the siege. Hideyoshi and Ieyasu wanted him out <br/>
the way kill the father, convert the sons, Hoji Ujinori seems to be <br/>
the only one who got any benifit out of the siege ending, only 10 000 <br/>
koku fief is not great in terms of benifit. Ujinao died alone, Uji <br/>
Kuni unsure. <br/>
<br/>
Hideysohi and Tokugawa wanted the Kanto they needed it. They need the <br/>
rich land, to give to loyal retainers, they need stategic control of <br/>
the Tokkaido roadway that goes from Kamakura to Kyoto, they need the <br/>
city of Odawara fortress, It could be used as a staging post for <br/>
attacks into the North. Tokugawa Ieyasu used the Kanto to his <br/>
advantage, first he built Edo attracting many people and valuable <br/>
craftsmen then he took steps to control the Tokkaido roadway. He was <br/>
always now in a position to threaten the capital whenever he wanted, <br/>
at Sekigahara its the way he marched. In general the kanto was <br/>
valuable.<br/>
<br/>
Date Masumune did not send troops to Odawara, he submitted in 1590 <br/>
when his forces in Aizu came into contact with Hideyoshis, he <br/>
submitted Aizu but at the time of Odawara, he was busy fighting <br/>
Asahina, Mogami and various others. The key in my opinion as I tried <br/>
to suggest was Uesugi kagekatsu, and now I also realise Uesugi <br/>
Kenshin, well not him because he was dead, but he was the Kanto <br/>
Kanrei. In 1578 when he died who became Kanto kanrei, was it possible <br/>
that the Uesugi family took on the role esp Uesugi Kagekatsu, could <br/>
it even have been possible that he was assasinated by Tokugawa or <br/>
Hideyoshi because they knew in the future he may not support a <br/>
campaign against the Kanto, being Kanto Kanrei himself. I only <br/>
speculate. But it is likely that if Uesugi Kenshin was still alive he <br/>
would have resited aggresive moves into the Kanto possibly allying <br/>
with Hojo, this is counterfactual and only conjecture. The main point <br/>
is that the Uesugi family in Echigo and influence in the Kanto were <br/>
the key block in the defeat of the Hojo. <br/>
<br/>
Because I only have access to limited sources, I am only wondering, <br/>
someone with Japanese sources on this time could do a better job <br/>
probably.<br/>
<br/>
