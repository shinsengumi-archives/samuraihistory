<h3>CSI Mistake?</h3>
by <i>mitsurugi_guy</i>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1475074569">Last night, Feb. 5, CSI had a new episode where a colletion of 17th<br/>
Japanese samurai antiques were stolen. There was samurai armor in the<br/>
mix and the lead guy said it was out of place because there was no<br/>
formal Japanese military until 1865. Am I wrong, but I thought when<br/>
the army went to Meiji they did away with the armor and used the<br/>
uniform and guns or did I just misundertand what happened?</div>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1636798357">I saw the same episode.  A character, reading from a book (probably a history book) stated that Japan did not have an army until 1868, the year that the Emperor Meji was restored.<br/>
<br/>
I hate to sound like a politician, but it probably depends on what you mean by an "army".  You could argue that until the Meji restoration that Japan did not have a central army, on the grounds that before then it had clan based provincial armies.<br/>
<br/>
Even the Shogun's army could be considered his own personal army as opposed to a national Japanese army. Certainly, the Emperor did not have an army.<br/>
<br/>
Besides, it's a great TV show and they usually get things right.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>I don't understand the point. If it's 17th century, it's before 1865. What do <br/>
you mean?<br/>
