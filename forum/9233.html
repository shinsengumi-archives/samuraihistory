 </span></blockquote>It is my understanding that the samurai lived a very strict and<br/>
ritualistic lifestyle. They were under the service of and dedicated<br/>
fully to a daimyo or lord. most Were paid in rice, which was farmed by<br/>
the underclass which were not allowed to wear the swords. Any samurai<br/>
who wished to test out his new shinken or (real sword),for a price<br/>
could cut down a criminal who had been caught as Japan had no prisons.<br/>
Death was the customary punishment for every offense. Sometimes<br/>
samurai would cut down innocent people to test their steel if no one<br/>
was looking but this was most likely not the norm. Samurai means to<br/>
serve and a samurai was also called bushi being the plural or bujin<br/>
for one of them. Most of Japan's population consisted of lower class<br/>
farmers however until later on in the history when Japan began to<br/>
adopt more western ways. Guns were introduced by the first europeans<br/>
but not given or sold to them one man made a sketch of one of the guns<br/>
and within 6 months there were guns aplenty. The samurai adopted their<br/>
use for a short time until they were considered dishonorable and the<br/>
samurai abandoned there use willingly. The use of a jo or staff was<br/>
the weapon used by almost all japanese poeple and the main weapon of<br/>
the lower class to defend against the samurai. Then there were the<br/>
Ninja. This was an illegal occupation but Hattori Hanzo who was ninja<br/>
is mentioned in the history as bushi. They were the spies and assasins<br/>
of old japan and were hired out by a diamyo to obtain information or<br/>
deal with an enemy lord. They employed many dishonorable tactics and<br/>
devices including throwing venomous snakes on their foes. Samurai<br/>
would stand and state their name and such before fighting in duels<br/>
which usually lasted 30 seconds or less.Ninja did not and snuk around<br/>
and disguised themselves and such. Ninja were more effective in combat<br/>
than most samurai though and usually acted alone. Slaying a sleeping<br/>
army and other similar antics. Honor meant everything to the samurai<br/>
and they would not hesitate to commit hara kiri done with the<br/>
wakizashi one would stick the blade into his gut with the goal of<br/>
cutting the spine from the front then another would end his suffering<br/>
with a beheading. Someone the former had chosen to assist him in<br/>
restoring his honor. A samurai could probably take down a charging<br/>
bull but I would not expect the could have tussled succesfully with a<br/>
grizzly bear.</div>

 </span></blockquote>Some did, some didn't. <br/>
<br/>
 They were under the service<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> > of and dedicated<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>You've been watching too many anime or movies. <br/>
<br/>
 most Were paid in rice,<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> > which was farmed by<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Post-sword hunt, that's correct. Before the 1590's,<br/>
that would be a complete fallacy. Even during the Edo<br/>
period, commoners were allowed to carry personal<br/>
protection weapons, to include short swords. <br/>
<br/>
Any samurai<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> > who wished to test out his new shinken or (real<br/>
> sword),for a price<br/>
> could cut down a criminal who had been caught as<br/>
> Japan had no prisons.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Japan most definitely had prisons. Not sure where the<br/>
hell you came up with that one.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> > Death was the customary punishment for every<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>"Me? No, I didn't cut that guy down...you didn't see<br/>
me, did you? Nope, wasn't me..."<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> > Samurai means to<br/>
> serve and a samurai was also called bushi being the<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>"bushi" isn't the plural of "bujin". Japanese has no<br/>
plural or singular--the plural of "bushi" is "bushi",<br/>
the singular of "bushi" is "bushi. Plural or singular<br/>
is determined by context or counters. <br/>
<br/>
 Guns were introduced by the<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> > first europeans<br/>
> but not given or sold to them one man made a sketch<br/>
> of one of the guns<br/>
> and within 6 months there were guns aplenty.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Wow, this is so wrong it's not even funny. There's no<br/>
possible way that someone who'd never seen one before<br/>
could make a sketch of an arquebus and then create<br/>
one. The swordmaker of the lord of Tanegashima island,<br/>
where the first Portuguese landed and demonstrated<br/>
firearms, aquired several arquebuses, and was able to<br/>
do everything except figure out how to seal the<br/>
barrel. For the secret to this, he traded his daughter<br/>
to a Portuguese merchant. <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
 The<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> > samurai adopted their<br/>
> use for a short time until they were considered<br/>
> dishonorable and the<br/>
> samurai abandoned there use willingly.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>God, no. No, no, no, no, and no. "Dishonorable" had<br/>
nothing to do with anything. <br/>
<br/>
 The use of a<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> > jo or staff was<br/>
> the weapon used by almost all japanese poeple and<br/>
> the main weapon of<br/>
> the lower class to defend against the samurai.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Um, no. <br/>
<br/>
 Then<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> > there were the<br/>
> Ninja. <br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Stop. I can't even begin to read the idiocy you write<br/>
here. Go to the link I posted, go read the section on<br/>
ninja. You've managed to post every single myth and<br/>
Hollywood fantasy possible here, congrats. <br/>
<br/>
They employed many<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> > dishonorable tactics and<br/>
> devices including throwing venomous snakes on their<br/>
> foes. <br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Hmm...that's a new one. <br/>
<br/>
Samurai<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> > would stand and state their name and such before<br/>
> fighting in duels<br/>
> which usually lasted 30 seconds or less.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Yes, Samurai stated their names and lineage prior to<br/>
battle...a practice that died out before 1300, because<br/>
it was completely impractical. This ended essentially<br/>
during the Mongol invasions, since those nasty Mongols<br/>
didn't play nice and simply shot the brave Samurai in<br/>
the middle of his introduction speech. <br/>
<br/>
Ninja did<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> > not and snuk around<br/>

> effective in combat<br/>
> than most samurai though and usually acted alone.<br/>
> Slaying a sleeping<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Slaying a sleeping army? At once? Wow, those ninjers<br/>
are Kool. <br/>
<br/>
Honor meant<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> > everything to the samurai<br/>
> and they would not hesitate to commit hara kiri done<br/>
> with the<br/>

> restoring his honor.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Yup, I saw in a comic book that some samurai called<br/>
his friend by the wrong name, so to atone he cut his<br/>
own stomach right then and there, without even<br/>
thinking about it. Those samurai were always<br/>
committing suicide...<br/>
<br/>
No. And....no. <br/>
<br/>
 A samurai could probably take<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> > down a charging<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Actually, many samurai were successful economically,<br/>
in both the prosperous and lean times...<br/>
<br/>
...or did you really mean to give your opinion vis a<br/>
vis various animals? &#12414;&#12387;&#12383;&#12367;&#12290;&#12290;&#12290;&#12290;<br/>

I think that if a couple of ninja help the samurai, he could take  <br/>
down even Godzilla.<br/>

<br/>
  Strangely enough, Kurihara Hikasaburo, the great Showa period sword patron who was also a politician, did throw a live snake at an opponent in the Diet! Not a samurai, but close, I guess.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-450594243">Hey everyone, <br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
My name is John Perry and I have been a lurker for a while and this is my<br/>
first post.  <br/>
<br/>
To give a quick introduction of myself Ive been living in Fukuoka, Japan<br/>
for about <br/>
<br/>
8 years now practicing mainly Aikido but also Iaido, Kyudo, and Shodo and I<br/>
work as a <br/>
<br/>
Scuba Diving Instructor and an Outdoor Guide and have been enjoying this<br/>
group very much<br/>
<br/>
as I have a keen interest in Japanese history.<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
I dont mean to prolong this thread too much longer but I just wanted to<br/>
clarify a comment made about <br/>
<br/>
there only being poisonous snakes in Okinawa.  While the Habu is probably<br/>
the most infamous <br/>
<br/>
snake in Japan there are quite a few poisonous snakes throughout Japan, all<br/>
the way to Hokkaido.<br/>
<br/>
This is a link to a web page I found about snakes in Japan and if you scroll<br/>
down you will find a family <br/>
<br/>
of poisonous snakes and a brief description of there geographic<br/>
distribution.<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
http://homepage3.nifty.com/japrep/snake/ejaphebi.htm<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
Sorry for my first post to be a bit off topic but I though it might be<br/>
relevant to this current discussion.<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
Cheers,<br/>

apparently ninja were able to breed poisonous snakes<br/>
as well. <br/>

 </span></blockquote>Sorry, I do not fancy to go on and read about Japanese snakes, but  <br/>
isn't that there is a difference between 'poisonous' and 'lethal' ?<br/>
You mean that in Japan there are snakes that can actually kill you?<br/>
<br/>
I ask, because I really have NO idea and I am too lazy for a  <br/>
search... ;oD<br/>
<br/>
If that's the case; however, it seems strange to me they have not  <br/>
been used often in reality or at least in literature.<br/>
<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1397995642">Hello Guild,<br/>
<br/>
I wanted to help out on the paper, sorry if I'm late about it...<br/>
<br/>
* For one thing, I am interested in the samurai because they seem <br/>
far more sophisticated than any other warrior or soldier from those <br/>
times. Honor and discipline were there basic structure in the way of <br/>
their lifestyle.<br/>
<br/>
* To honestly tell you the truth, I am American and Puerto Rican, so <br/>
no.<br/>
<br/>
* I really have no artifacts accept a functional samurai sword that <br/>
i got from a japanese trader i believe, I knew how it was made also <br/>
if you wanted to know that~<br/>
<br/>
* Well i think the samurai from earlier times were not that <br/>
different than from the ones that we know very much about. the only <br/>
thing different that i think of was their swords and fighting back <br/>
then. I heard that there swords before the katana were like a <br/>
Chinese Tai-Chi.<br/>
<br/>
* I think that they were described by how they were decorated with <br/>
the swords, like now our soldiers are decorated by their ribbons and <br/>
medals; so they had ranks, there was a samurai, then Master Samurai <br/>
I believe.<br/>
<br/>
* Their lifestyle differs from that of a commoner, swordsman,or a <br/>
ninja because of their discipline and honor.<br/>
