<div id="ygrps-yiv-528627959">HI<br/>
<br/>
I think the straight sword was more a creation of<br/>
Steve Hayes in the late 70's and early 80's. He ghost<br/>
wrote a book called Ninjutsu history and traditons<br/>
which was a butchered version of a book by his teacher<br/>
Hatsumi masaaki called Sengoku Ninpo Zukan which is a<br/>
wonderful work on ninjutsu. Its a shame he wrote<br/>
something that is only 50% accurate<br/>
<br/>
The ninja were not all alike, in fact depending on<br/>
there location and period in history that each school<br/>
exisited there skills could be greatly different. For<br/>
instance there is one school recorded that used young<br/>
girls to sleep with passing high ranking samurai to<br/>
use sex for information, they have no fighting skills.<br/>
Then there are schools such as Iga ryu which would<br/>
have had amassive variety of skills fomr Taijutsu<br/>
(jujutsu) to spear, sword, maybe even explosives at<br/>
some point. <br/>
<br/>
As for holding doors open.<br/>
<br/>
Many of these schools would have had items they could<br/>
use for opening doors such as the kunai, and also<br/>
metal spikes that could lock a door shut ot keep it<br/>
open by 'nailing' it into place.<br/>
<br/>
Caltrops when made of metal are called Tetsubishi and<br/>
when dropped always fall with one spike upwards. there<br/>
are also natural plant seeds that worked the same<br/>
(forgot the name). <br/>
<br/>
Many ninja things are not exclusive to the ninja.<br/>
Samurai would involve the same items as well if<br/>
needed. Also some skills are not solely ninja only.<br/>
For instance the negoro ryu of Ninjutsu was a school<br/>
that specialised in the use of the gun, but so did<br/>
some samurai schools. This school just made itself a<br/>
specialist in this field. <br/>
<br/>
Today ninjutsu is as good as dead, there are many good<br/>
historians and even some practioners in the modern<br/>
aspects of the art. What can be classed as old style<br/>
ninjutsu is long gone, and I speak of this as an<br/>
instructor of the Bujinkan dojo which pushed the<br/>
Ninjutsu boom in the 80's. It is a long time now since<br/>
I pushed ninjutsu aside and just look on it now as a<br/>
area of interest for reading. I prefer the samurai<br/>
aspects of the bujinkan<br/>
<br/>
Anything you see in a western movie that involves<br/>
ninja is as good as 95% inaccurate, japanese movies<br/>
etc are also not accurate.<br/>

impede/distract a pursuer, etc. The general shape of<br/>
"tetsubishi" ("iron diamonds") is a 4 pointed object<br/>
with the points such that if you throw them down,<br/>
there is always one point up and 3 points as a base.<br/>
Think of jacks, from the kids game, except sharper. <br/>
<br/>
The small discs with the sharp edges you refer to are<br/>
shuriken. There's several names according to the<br/>
shape, etc., and I'm sure one of our resident ninja<br/>
masters will pipe up and tell us, but I'm not sure<br/>
what all they are. I know under the heading of<br/>
"shuriken", you've got all sorts of shapes and sizes<br/>
of throwing knives, including the disc and star shaped<br/>
types. <br/>
