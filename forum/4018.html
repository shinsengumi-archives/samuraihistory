<div id="ygrps-yiv-955603736">to many people seem to assume that self presevation is honor to <br/>
defend isnt honour uts the right to exist. Duty is however you <br/>
personally feel u will do what is expected and demanded of you in a <br/>
time of need.Loyalty to have a cause thatt your loyal to that is true <br/>
honour. To many people think samurai are super human honourable <br/>
dashing chracters and that just doesnt exist. akira kurosawas films <br/>
aimed at showing this. True honour comes from within the fight for <br/>
what you feel is right not some rich war lord that sends you to war <br/>
to inrich his estates. Anyway im in kyoto in two months ne one got ne <br/>
good sites to see</div>
