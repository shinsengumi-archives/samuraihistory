At least I thought they'd get it to at least resemble Japan after our <br/>

correct than the film was. <br/>
<br/>
Some examples--<br/>
<br/>
(SPOILER ALERT IF YOU HAVE NOT YET SEEN TLS FILM)<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Several Samurai wearing only one katana<br/>
<br/>
A fallen Samurai committing seppukuu with a tante (dagger or knife) <br/>
rather than using his katana blade<br/>
<br/>
A reference to a field artillery cannon as a 'howitzer' years before <br/>
the howitzer was invented.<br/>
<br/>
Samurai participating in covert (spying) operations. Samurai detested <br/>
spying and any other form of deceit. To this end they usually used <br/>
Ninjas for this purpose.<br/>
<br/>
Samurai in 1876-1877 still wearing ceremonial armour into battle and <br/>
allowing an outsider (Cruise as a cavalry captain) to wear the armour <br/>
of the man he killed. I don't recall Kenshin Himura or even Saitoh <br/>
Hajime wearing armour on RK or SX. <br/>
<br/>
The battle was laughable. No Samurai will wait for an enemy he is <br/>
facing to attack first. Especially when he has the advantage of a <br/>
cavalry charge against infantry. <br/>
<br/>
All things considered I think that Richard Chamberlain (The Shogun) <br/>
did <br/>
a better job as a Samurai than Tom Cruise. Even Chuck Norris would <br/>
have <br/>
been a better choice. <br/>
<br/>
Ken Watanabe was robbed. He deserved the Best Supporting Actor Oscar <br/>
that year. I did hear he won some anime filming achievement awards <br/>
earlier this year though. <br/>
<br/>
Well more soon. Kami bless and toodles-K&K<br/>

<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1432861097">Wow you really have to be kidding...   First on the part about the howitzer <br/>
comment...  b/c I do have some expertise when it comes to american weapons.  <br/>
  The part about the american weapons would probablly  be the most accurate <br/>
stuff in the movie.  More than likely the Howitzer in the movie was supposed <br/>
to be the Model 1841 Field Howitzer - 12 Pounder.   (Hint the 1841 was the <br/>
year it went into service with the US army) With them even doing a decent <br/>
job of  showing them max elevating the guns to get to their maximum range <br/>
which was only about 1000 yards.   As a matter of fact most Field artillery <br/>
personnel would refer them as guns... i.e. a 4 gun or 6 gun battery.   Not <br/>
as cannons.  There is a difference between guns and howitzers in that guns <br/>
shot higher velocities and flatter trajectories and had greater range.  The <br/>
nomenclature of the weapons themselves started to include both terms gun and <br/>
howitzer such as the Model 1857 light 12-pdr gun-howitzer and still actually <br/>
called that today.<br/>
Now about some of the Japanese references you made.   I cannot speak at all <br/>
on the historical accuracy of the timelines and people involved other than I <br/>
know that there was no american involvement (that I am aware of) in the <br/>
Satsuma rebellion on which the film is loosely based.  Technically speaking <br/>
I wasn't aware of any samurai ever carrying more than one Katana.   They <br/>
carried katana and wakizashi and from what I remember every battle scene in <br/>
the movie, all the samurai are wearing 'the two swords'.  The man that <br/>
commits seppuku is using a wakizashi... not a katana, and samurai would <br/>
never use a katana to commit seppuku.  It is always was a wakizashi or <br/>
tanto, with the tanto being used quite often.<br/>
<br/>
Ninja's... you might as well get ready to be fragged for that one.<br/>
<br/>
For the battle...  Calvary with swords vs light infantry with actually <br/>
weapons with with rifled barrels and cartridges... i will stand with the <br/>
infantry on that one.<br/>
<br/>
On a personal note, I enjoyed the movie.  I have seen so many people really <br/>
dissect this movie about historical inaccuracies, when I wasn't aware the <br/>
movie was suppose to be a documentary.  I didn't see in the beginning <br/>
credits "based on actual events".  How often does a movie get it right <br/>
anyways?  'Blackhawk down' was full of inaccuracies, just like 'We were <br/>
Soldiers' was as well, and both of those movies were based on actual events. <br/>
  Movies rarely come close to being right when they are just based on a <br/>
novel, much less an actual historical event. I also didn't recall anywhere <br/>
throughout the movie Tom Cruise gettin up and saying ' I am the last <br/>
samurai'.   I don't recall him ever refering to himself as a samurai period. <br/>
   I actually thought he did a decent job with the swordplay, being a novice <br/>
practioner of Iaido myself.<br/>
<br/>
Good luck with the anime.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-806081939">Well, I thought that the Wazikashi was actually used for sepeku and that some of the most notable Ninja were also Samurai. I also thought that Ninja used Katans as well since for one, the Ninjto was a post WWII invention for tourists. I also remember something about Ninjito as stage swords for Japanese actors.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-292620611">I agree there were historical mistakes, but it was a movie and not intended to be a documentary or re-enactment. I was actually quite pleased with the film despite its short-comings. I felt that it captured several powerful emotions which may have been present at those last moments of samurai existence. <br/>
<br/>
But some of the things you mentioned really don't bother me. For example, the suggestion that an outsider would be taken in the way Tom Cruise's character was... That is obviously part of what makes the story interesting, not particularly anything historical. We know that William Adams was taken in, as you alluded too, but that hardly would make it a common thing. As far as seppuku is concerned, there was really no end to what type of bladed instrument a samurai might have used. <br/>
<br/>
So, while I agree that it isn't the best source of historical information, I still found it to be acceptable from an entertainment point of view. Film is a much more widely accepted form of media than anime, and I am fairly confident that more English-speaking people were willing to watch Tom Cruise than watch Japanimation. Cruise's character was, afterall, a civil war captain... Not necessarily a samurai. <br/>

restoration but one Taiga drama, Shinsengumi, showed some flashy armor <br/>
being used in battle. I will note that NHK has modified history in the <br/>
past to improve a storyline or a scene. There are some photos from this <br/>
period and tons of ukiyo-e that show armor used in this period.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1096682907">Good day, everyone. I am racking my brain trying to find information about Mibu-dera's Mibuzaka Mound. I figured this might be the best place to ask my question. Which of the Shinsengumi members are buried, interred, etc. on the grounds of Mibu-dera? Obviously, there is a famous bust of Kondo Isami there. Also, I believe Serizawa Kamo and Hirayama Goro are there as well. However, most information seems to say that there are twenty-some monuments/graves here. <br/>

Wow you really have to be kidding... First on the part about the howitzer <br/>
comment... b/c I do have some expertise when it comes to american weapons. <br/>
For the battle... Calvary with swords vs light infantry with actually <br/>
weapons with with rifled barrels and cartridges... i will stand with the <br/>
infantry on that one.<br/>

restoration but one Taiga drama, Shinsengumi, showed some flashy armor <br/>
being used in battle. I will note that NHK has modified history in the <br/>
past to improve a storyline or a scene. There are some photos from this <br/>
period and tons of ukiyo-e that show armor used in this period.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-496815234">I studied kendo for ten years (until my health took me out). I'm not sure that watching films is the best place to learn sword skills or any other martial arts skills. Do you practice in a school with a sensei? If so, you can ask your sensei about "The Last Samurai" and whatever sword tactics might be included within. If you don't practice in a school with a sensei, I would try and find a well-reputed school and sign up. This is a much better place to learn sword techniques rather than try and pick them up from films -- which after all are choreographed. <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1617762403">Hi Nina,<br/>
      I completely understand watching "The Last Samurai" or any other Martial Arts film is NOT the best resources for learning any type of Martial Arts or watching any period movie to learn about history for that matter.  I am curious about that time period in Japanese history but for learning the actual history, I pick up a book.  As for learning Martial Arts, I study Aikido at the Aikido of Virginia Beach Dojo www.aikido-of-virginia-beach.com and my sensei is very outstanding in his weapons training.  During the one sceen where they were training in the field, I noticed a few familar bokken suburi techniques I have learned in the dojo.  It is very important not to rely on movies to learn.  They are for entertainment only and there is two reasons I can think of for not using movies for research regarding Martial Arts, one is you will look like an fool and two, you can do yourself and others serious injury by showing off your "moves" you learned from the Karate Kid.<br/>

Do you practice in a school with a sensei? If so, you can ask your sensei about "The Last Samurai" and whatever sword tactics might be included within. If you don't practice in a school with a sensei, I would try and find a well-reputed school and sign up. This is a much better place to learn sword techniques rather than try and pick them up from films -- which after all are choreographed. <br/>

Well said. People have got to remember that these films are for entertainment purposes only. I for one can not stand Tom Cruse and it took every ounce of concentration to ignore his part in the film because I was only interested in the Martial Arts techniques. If one wants to know the true story of that period, pick up a book (sometimes you can't really rely on the internet for research). As a Civil War reenactor, I picked out several of flaws but that didn't stop me from learning a thing or two about sword techinques. By the way, I waited till that flick came out on AMC. I refuse to waste any of my hard earned money on a Tom Cruse movie ~_^<br/>

	We are talking about the modern period (post 1868) and we are still  <br/>
talking about that silly movie, but I hope the moderators will  <br/>
indulge us a bit longer. The Saga and other earlier rebellions were  <br/>
about the loss of privileges, really the loss of income as the  <br/>
government cut back on the stipends they paid out to disenfranchised  <br/>
bushi. Satsumas rebellion was started by students of the shigakko  <br/>
(most had never had Samurai status) who were convinced the central  <br/>
government meant to assassinate Saigo. They were of course joined by  <br/>
ex-army types that had come home with Saigo and others with a grudge  <br/>
against the new leadership. What I find interesting is that Saigo  <br/>
(and the new Meiji police forces) knew that if he were to reach  <br/>
Honshu he would have of course been joined by all those out of work  <br/>
samurai and would have been an unstoppable force. He could have  <br/>
easily skirted Kumamoto-jo or even taken an Eastern route to Dazaifu  <br/>
but chose not to.<br/>
	This begs the question why did he insist on investing Kumamoto?  <br/>
Tabaru-zaka was not the decisive battle but it was 17 days of hard  <br/>
fighting where he spent much of his force. Was his loyalty to the  <br/>
Emperor, whom he raised from a boy, so strong that he intentionally  <br/>
fought a battle of attrition rather than risk actually threatening  <br/>
him and the government Saigo himself had set up for him to lead?  <br/>
Samurai pigheadedness is hardly an explanation for his siege of the  <br/>
castle.<br/>
	I agree that once they paused at Kumamoto the outcome was inevitable  <br/>
for the very reasons you cite above; Government logistics and  <br/>
communications. I would point out though that the fierce fighting at  <br/>
Tabaru-zaka is where the image of sword versus gun comes from.  <br/>
Because of the heavy weather and the thick bamboo groves there the  <br/>
government guns and numbers were ineffective. So much so that a  <br/>
special Batto-tai was formed of Aizu men who went in to fight sword  <br/>
to sword against the rebels. The weather broke and new artillery was  <br/>
brought to bear on the area breaking the Satsuma hold on the road,  <br/>
but it was only weeks later that the army broke up and all that was  <br/>
left was to chase Saigo and his little band back to Shiroyama.<br/>
	What drives me mad about this film and others is how Hollywood  <br/>
always feeds us entertaining tripe like this even though the real  <br/>
history is so much more interesting. And this story has so many great  <br/>
stories within it it is just amazing that they seem to have missed  <br/>
them all!<br/>
Makes me want to throw my sword at someone...<br/>

of the 47 Loyal Retainers uses a "yari te" in the<br/>
final battle scene.<br/>

The movie is, of course, loosely based on the Satsuma rebellion of <br/>
1877. Although the story in the film is significantly different from <br/>
what actually transpired in 1877, I found a few themes to be common. <br/>
First, the origin of the Satsuma rebellion was in the dissatisfaction <br/>
of the samurai at the ending of their way of life. Secondly, as with <br/>
Ken Watanabe in the movie, Saigo Takamori did indeed have deep <br/>
respect for the emperor. Finally, the failure of Saigo's rebellion <br/>
was partially due to the fact that he was fighting in an old Japanese <br/>
style, while the Meiji government had westernized their methods. <br/>
However, it was not really western weapons versus Japanese weapons on <br/>
the battlefields of the Satsuma rebellion, since both sides used <br/>
guns. Rather, the Meiji government made much better use of western-<br/>
style logistics (reinforcements) and communications (the telegraph). <br/>
The Meiji government was able to get Saigo bogged down in Kumamoto, <br/>
while they sent in reinforcements and eventually overwhelmed him at <br/>
Tabaru-zaka.<br/>
