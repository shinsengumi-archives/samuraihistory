<h3>Yet more genealogy questions</h3>
by <i>kitsuno</i>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1385098171">Looking at the connection between the Tokugawa and the Maeda clans, I <br/>
find that a daughter of Tokugawa Hidetada (Ne- or Nene- hime [1599-<br/>
1622]) married Maeda Toshitsune [1593-1658].  does anyone know if his <br/>
sons Mitsumasa, Toshitsugi, and Toshiharu were sons of Hidetada's <br/>
daughter?<br/>
<br/>
Second question - Hidetada's daughter Senhime married Honda <br/>
Tadatoshi, a nephew of Honda Tadamasa.  Does anyone know who his <br/>
father was (which brother of Honda Tadamasa)?<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Thanks for any assistance!</div>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-2097182271">Isn't she Tama-hime?Ne might be her another name ,but I have never <br/>
heard of.All of the three sons you reffer to are hers.But the name <br/>
Mitsmasa should be Mitsutaka.And Toshitsugi might be Toshitsugu.<br/>
<br/>
Senhime's spouse is Honda Tadatoki.He is the son of Tadamasa,not <br/>
nephew.Tadamasa is the son of Tadakatsu.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-2070476223">The Japanese book I'm looking at has her name in Kanji as "Ko" <br/>
followed by the 'repeat the previous' kanji, and the furigana <br/>

It says she married Maeda Toshitsune: 利常  AKA Toshimitsu: 利光<br/>
It has her as the second daughter of Hidetada.  I'll post this to see <br/>
if the Kanji posts along with it, and then take a look at what I have <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-107442108">Hello<br/>
The author is right.The kanji q can be read as "ne" when it <br/>
means "mouse" as one of the 12 "eto" mascots.And as I searched by the <br/>
word qXP,some webpages says Nenehime is Tamahime's another <br/>
name.She is also called Tentoku-in.<br/>

as 'nephew'(Oi) - not sure how I did that.  But this may be a stupid <br/>
question, but how did Senhime marry both Tadatoki and Hideyori when <br/>
they both died in 1615? (also, was Tadatoki also known as Tadatoshi?  <br/>
A.L. Sadler, in his biography of Ieyasu has it as Tadatoshi.  Not <br/>
that I trust his spelling all that much...)<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-137128275">Oops, disregard that.  There were two Honda Tadatokis, the one who <br/>
died in 1615 was AKA Tadatomo, and was Honda Tadatoki's Uncle.  <br/>
Solves that problem.  The Tadatoki married to Senhime died in 1626.  <br/>
Senhime was actually his half first cousin, once removed, by the <br/>
way.It looks like relations married with some frequency during the <br/>
sengoku period.<br/>
