<br/>
By HIROKO OIKAWA Contributing Writer<br/>
<br/>
Chances are you've heard of ``The Tale of Genji,'' the 1,000-year-<br/>
old tale of romance that's considered the world's first great novel. <br/>
<br/>
But chances are you've never experienced the book, penned by court <br/>
lady Murasaki Shikibu, in quite the way it's being presented by <br/>
Yukiza, a centuries-old marionette theater. <br/>
<br/>
The idea of turning the epic story into a play for puppets was <br/>
unimaginable-until last year. <br/>
<br/>
Produced by the Shizuoka Convention and Arts Center Granship, ``Yume <br/>
no Ukihashi'' (Floating bridge in a dream), a play based on the <br/>
timeless love story, was performed last spring by Yukiza, which <br/>
boasts 370 years of tradition. The production, which has been <br/>
performed only in Shizuoka and a few other prefectures, will finally <br/>
make it to Tokyo in late July. <br/>
<br/>
The project was the brainchild of Hajime Yamamoto, Granship's <br/>
executive director. It was his dream to have the world of Genji <br/>
staged by the marionette troupe. <br/>
<br/>
But at first, Yamamoto's proposal didn't seem feasible to Magosaburo <br/>
Yuki XII, who heads the company. <br/>
<br/>
``I wasn't sure if we'd be able to do it, because a pure love story <br/>
without action scenes was not in our repertoire,'' Yuki said in an <br/>
interview at the company's studio in Tokyo. <br/>
<br/>
Also initially unsure was Makoto Sato, who wrote the script and <br/>
directed the production. Preparing the script took three years and <br/>
required him to pore over the lengthy novel in classical Japanese <br/>
and two modern translations. <br/>
<br/>
The result was ``Yume no Ukihashi,'' an adaptation of the 54-chapter <br/>
story of Genji, an aristocratic playboy, and Kaoru, his wife's <br/>
illegitimate son. Sato's adaptation is narrated by Ukifune, a <br/>
heroine in the novel's final chapter who attempts suicide following <br/>
her involvement with Kaoru in a love triangle. She leads the <br/>
audience to the world of Genji, where key epsodes from the epic <br/>
novel unfold. <br/>
<br/>
Of particular note about this production is the interaction between <br/>
the Yukiza's marionettes and a human actor, which calls for a bit of <br/>
imagination on the part of the audience. <br/>
<br/>
Ukifune, the storyteller, is played by actress Tomoko Mariya. Other <br/>
characters, including Genji, his wife, Aoi, and his lovers, Yugao <br/>
and Rokujo no miyasudokoro-whose malignant spirit leads Aoi to her <br/>
death-are portrayed by marionettes. <br/>
<br/>
Mariya also plays Genji in one scene and Rokujo in another, <br/>
interacting and conversing with marionettes. <br/>
<br/>
Founded in 1635, Yukiza was one of five shogunate-supported theater <br/>
companies in Edo, as Tokyo was known under Tokugawa rule. Of the <br/>
five, only Yukiza still operates as a troupe. <br/>
<br/>
Yuki feels the group's innovative spirit was the key to its <br/>
survival. <br/>
<br/>
``Performers in traditional arts tend to stick with classics, which <br/>
were unproven new works when they were first performed. With that in <br/>
mind, we want to create new works that can become classics later. <br/>
That was the thinking of my father and grandfather,'' he says. <br/>
<br/>
Born in 1943 to Magosaburo Yuki X and Sokyo Takemoto, a samisen-<br/>
playing storyteller in gidayu tradition, Yuki said he was playing <br/>
with marionettes as far back as he can remember. <br/>
<br/>
``Marionettes were just about the only toys I could find around me. <br/>
I taught myself how to manipulate them,'' he recalls. <br/>
<br/>
After his debut at age 4, he continued teaching himself the art <br/>
rather than training under his father. As a teenager, he studied <br/>
other traditional arts, including Kabuki, Noh and kyogen, under <br/>
acknowledged masters. <br/>
<br/>
``Like many other people born into the world of traditional arts, I <br/>
was at the point of no return before I knew it,'' he says. <br/>
<br/>
Meanwhile, Yuki was involved in the underground theater movement of <br/>
the 1960s, which explored new styles of expression. Among the people <br/>
he met in those days was Sato, one of the scene's leading lights. <br/>
<br/>
Yuki and Sato have worked together since their 1975 production of <br/>
``Shojo Kamen,'' written by actor and scriptwriter Juro Kara. Their <br/>
use of marionettes instead of human actors drew large audiences. <br/>
<br/>
That innovative spirit prompted the company to stage a Japanese-<br/>
language production of Shakespeare's ``Macbeth,'' which won a <br/>
special award at the 1986 Belgrade International Theater Festival. <br/>
Their artistic path eventually led them to ``Yume no Ukihashi.'' <br/>
<br/>
But in bringing the world of Genji to the stage, the marionette <br/>
artists had hurdles to clear. <br/>
<br/>
Among them was the use of delicate puppets designed by Sayoko <br/>
Yamaguchi, a top model in the 1970s. For the first time in the <br/>
company's history, the marionettes' faces and costumes were made <br/>
with traditional washi paper. <br/>
<br/>
``Made of paper rather than cloth, the marionettes are light and <br/>
hard to handle,'' Yuki says. <br/>
<br/>
For the audience, the extra effort makes a difference. The <br/>
marionettes, dressed in black or white costumes representing light <br/>
and shadow, make a deep impact. <br/>
<br/>
Another highlight of the production is 91-year-old Takemoto, Yuki's <br/>
samisen-playing mother. <br/>
<br/>
``When she forgets the song and starts improvising, we won't know <br/>
what to do with the marionettes,'' Yuki says with a laugh. <br/>
<br/>
Up next for Yukiza is a planned collaboration with a marionette <br/>
theater in China's Fujian province. <br/>
<br/>
``Maybe we'll do Shakespeare,'' Yuki said. ``The fusion of similar <br/>
yet different cultures will be a challenge.'' <br/>
