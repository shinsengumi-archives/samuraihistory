Well, since a concequence of his actions led to more and more<br/>
territory falling under his control, I think by default Nobunaga is<br/>
a 'unifier'...<br/>

Anyways, would Hideiyoshi and Tokugawa have gotten that far without<br/>
Nobunaga´s incursions? Specially Tokuwaga, who seemed to be at the right<br/>
time, at the right place? Whilst I do not intend to set myself as an expert<br/>
on the field (an enthusiast, rather - please bear this in mind), would it be<br/>
too far from feasible bounds to hold that Tokugawa won by default (lack of<br/>
capable opponents)?<br/>

I believe Oda Nobunaga was a great, if (personally) not likeable person. He<br/>
set himself (through ambition or just sheer consequence), and eventually<br/>
Japan upon the route to unification. His control was far more effectual than<br/>
that imposed four centuries earlier by either Taira no Kiyomori or Minamoto<br/>
no Yoritomo, but like these earlier examples, his control was only over the<br/>
central island of Honshu, not Kyushu, Shikoku, Chugoku (although that was<br/>
under way at the time of his death), Tohoku or Hokkaido. Although more<br/>
significant than Toyotomi Hideyoshi in what he established, it is Hideyoshi<br/>
who brought the bulk of the archipelago under a central administration and<br/>
was e facto unifier, although it was Nobunaga or set the work in motion and<br/>
undertook much of the hard labour (smashing the Ikko ikki, the Enryakuji,<br/>
the Imagawa, the Takeda, &c) that made the work of Toyotomi and the Tokugawa<br/>
considerably easier.<br/>

<br/>
Name someone who did NOT kill women and children in<br/>
16th century Japan. Ieyasu surely did. <br/>
<br/>
As was stated before, the story about Japanese mothers<br/>
using Nobunaga to scare their kids into obeying is<br/>
plain silliness--William's never heard of it, I've<br/>
never heard of it, I doubt Kitsuno, Tony, et al have<br/>
heard of it. I doubt Kitsuno's Japanese wife,<br/>
William's Japanese wife, their Japanese families,<br/>
etc., have heard of it. My Japanese friends haven't<br/>
heard of it, either. <br/>
<br/>
Yesterday I picked up several manga with Nobunaga as<br/>
the HERO. Characterizing him as a terrorist is naive.<br/>
The Japanese surely don't see him that way. Harsh<br/>
sometimes, yes. So was Alexander the Great. So was<br/>
Suleiman. So was Ghengis Khan. That hardly makes any<br/>
of them, including Nobunaga, evil. We went over this<br/>
before when someone compared him to Hitler--which is<br/>
absolutely RIDICULOUS. <br/>
<br/>
Yeah, Nobunaga killed Buddhist priests--the same ones<br/>
that defied his rule, harbored his enemies, attacked<br/>
his supply lines, and openly declared themselves his<br/>
enemies. He destroyed MT Hiei to eliminate it as a<br/>
THREAT, not because he was satan incarnate. Oh my<br/>
gosh, he had women and children killed! So did<br/>
everyone else at the time--nobody then operated under<br/>
the Geneva or Hague conventions. <br/>
<br/>
Nobunaga didn't enact a "final solution" against the<br/>
Iga ninja, aimed at systematically eliminating them as<br/>
a people by destroying anyone born in Iga. They defied<br/>
his control, so he acted to control them. Reality of<br/>
16th century Japan. <br/>
<br/>
Quit thinking in terms of modern media. You can't<br/>
apply modern battlefield ethics to 1945 (could you<br/>
IMAGINE the outcry that wholesale firebombing of<br/>
cities would creat today??), much less 1575. <br/>

Somebody's been watching too much CNN...<br/>
<br/>
Name someone who did NOT kill women and children in<br/>
16th century Japan. Ieyasu surely did.<br/>
<br/>
As was stated before, the story about Japanese mothers<br/>
using Nobunaga to scare their kids into obeying is<br/>
plain silliness--William's never heard of it, I've<br/>
never heard of it, I doubt Kitsuno, Tony, et al have<br/>
heard of it. I doubt Kitsuno's Japanese wife,<br/>
William's Japanese wife, their Japanese families,<br/>
etc., have heard of it. My Japanese friends haven't<br/>
heard of it, either.<br/>
<br/>
Yesterday I picked up several manga with Nobunaga as<br/>
the HERO. Characterizing him as a terrorist is naive.<br/>
The Japanese surely don't see him that way. Harsh<br/>
sometimes, yes. So was Alexander the Great. So was<br/>
Suleiman. So was Ghengis Khan. That hardly makes any<br/>
of them, including Nobunaga, evil. We went over this<br/>
before when someone compared him to Hitler--which is<br/>
absolutely RIDICULOUS.<br/>
<br/>
Yeah, Nobunaga killed Buddhist priests--the same ones<br/>
that defied his rule, harbored his enemies, attacked<br/>
his supply lines, and openly declared themselves his<br/>
enemies. He destroyed MT Hiei to eliminate it as a<br/>
THREAT, not because he was satan incarnate. Oh my<br/>
gosh, he had women and children killed! So did<br/>
everyone else at the time--nobody then operated under<br/>
the Geneva or Hague conventions.<br/>
<br/>
Nobunaga didn't enact a "final solution" against the<br/>
Iga ninja, aimed at systematically eliminating them as<br/>
a people by destroying anyone born in Iga. They defied<br/>
his control, so he acted to control them. Reality of<br/>
16th century Japan.<br/>
<br/>
Quit thinking in terms of modern media. You can't<br/>
apply modern battlefield ethics to 1945 (could you<br/>
IMAGINE the outcry that wholesale firebombing of<br/>
cities would creat today??), much less 1575.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>This I think is overstating it a bit in the opposite direction. Seeing <br/>
Nobunaga as a "demon" and all of that is definitely a modern, and it <br/>
seems to me western, way to interpret what he accomplished. But even <br/>
contemporary and Japanese sources do agree that Nobunaga was <br/>
something fierce. The Hiei-zan incident in particular is pointed to <br/>
as being well over the top, but there are several others.<br/>
<br/>
So I think it is fair to say that Nobunaga's methods were indeed <br/>
fearsome and from time to time were quite out of the norm even <br/>
within the context of the time period in Japan.<br/>
<br/>
My own interpretation of it is that Nobunaga really did go further <br/>
than most people of the time. One the one hand, this could be seen <br/>
as "terrorism" or something similar by those people who can read <br/>
history only in the context of their own personal, modern <br/>
experiences. On the other hand, this willingness to do these kind <br/>
of deeds probably is a symptom of whatever it was that Nobunaga "had" <br/>
that allowed him to play the historical role that he did.<br/>

I agree with what your saying - having reread what i put i didn't explain<br/>
myself properly -<br/>
<br/>
I was trying to say that, like Genghis Khan, he went that bit further than<br/>
his contemporaries because his lowly start to life meant he had to be that<br/>
little bit stronger to be accepted as a leader. Without going that extra<br/>
little bit he could never have hoped to maintain any level of control over<br/>
his fellow Samurai - instead their disdain for his lower status would have<br/>
lead to trouble - it was fear he used rather than terror as he targeted<br/>
those he felt opposed him rather than just indiscrimate killings which would<br/>
have made him a terrorist, instead he was no different to a hundred other<br/>
rulers - and certainly not as bad as some.<br/>

  Another thing about Nobunaga...<br/>
         I agree with those of you who have said he's not a terrorist.  From <br/>
  what I've seen and heard, a terrorist usually works outside the law, working to <br/>
  break it and create chaos.  Oda Nobunaga did no such thing.  He had the <br/>
  sanction of Ogimachi, I believe, from about 1562.  He deposed the last Ashikaga <br/>
  shogun, and was the first of what I've seen called the "three unifiers."  As for <br/>
  working outside the law, he essentially WAS the law, as seen, and noted by <br/>
  others in the group, through his repression of real or perceived threats and the <br/>
  aforementioned deposition of Ashikaga   Yoshiaki.  There was no bigger bully on <br/>
  the Sengoku block than Nobunaga, from Okehazama to Honnoji.  Shingen and <br/>
  Kenshin it seems were little more than a sidenote (even if the largest of them) to <br/>
  the Oda drive and wasn't one in some sort of alliance or another with the Oda <br/>
  anyway?<br/>
