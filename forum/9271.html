Thanks,  Nate for doing what I had no patience to do. Explain a few things. <br/>
 <br/>
As for the  snakes -- just thought of an idea for a new ninjer/chambara <br/>
movie: "Snakes in  the Palanquin" starring Tom Cruise.  :)<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1599779143">Yes the weapon is actually a rope tied around the snake tightly about 10 ft. long and on the other end is a nice big kama you know, the weapon that looks like a farm tool. While the enemy is dealing with the snake entangled around his body by the rope, the shinobi comes in close to deal an awful death with his kama. though there are set backs to this weapon it's a one shot sort of thing. So Tom will have to have a whole bag of them.<br/>
