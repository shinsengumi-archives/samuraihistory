The Japanese Sword�The Yoshihara Tradition of Swordmaking<br/>
Pacific Asian Museum, Pasadena March 19, 2005-June 19, 2005<br/>
<br/>
Press preview-<br/>
<br/>
The Pacific Asia Museum is proud to present Tosho--The Yoshihara tradition <br/>
of swordmaking. The exhibition, the first of its kind in Los Angeles for <br/>
over 30 years, features the work of twelve award winning swordsmiths, four <br/>
of whom have been awarded the rank of mukansa by the Agency of Cultural <br/>
Affairs of Japan. The exhibition highlights the idea that Japanese swords <br/>
are not merely weapons, but also spiritual objects of great artistic value. <br/>
The swords will be exhibited in same manner that they are displayed in <br/>
Japanese museums and shrines, far removed from their practical use, <br/>
illustrating the different styles of workmanship and expression of the <br/>
individual artist. The swords will be borrowed from collections on the West <br/>
coast of the United States, from collectors in Japan and from many of the <br/>
swordsmiths themselves.<br/>
<br/>
The Japanese sword is the most efficient, intrinsically beautiful, <br/>
meticulously handcrafted blade in the world. They are produced by methods of <br/>
manufacture that have remained relatively unchanged for a thousand years. <br/>
Once forged, they undergo a rigorous polishing procedure that involves as <br/>
many as 20 different grades of stones and copious amounts of water. This <br/>
polishing process enhances the wood grain like quality of the steel and the <br/>
hamon: a complex crystalline structure, created by the quenching process, <br/>
that traverses the blade�s edge. The hamon provides the blade with a tough <br/>
resilient edge that remains sharp even with heavy use.<br/>
<br/>
The sword has always been highly revered within Japanese society. It is one <br/>
of the three objects of the Japanese imperial regalia, along with the mirror <br/>
and the jewel. According to Japanese mythology, a sacred sword found in the <br/>
tail of a dragon was brought down from heaven with the ancient gods to begin <br/>
the imperial line of Japan. Swords are often dedicated to shrines and <br/>
temples as gifts for the residing kami (gods) or as vessels for them to <br/>
reside in. The changes in shape and manufacture of Japanese blades reflect <br/>
the periods in which they were produced, and in many cases, it was the sword <br/>
that wrote Japanese history. Later, during the peaceful Edo period <br/>
(1603-1868), the sword was viewed as an instrument of direction for the <br/>
warrior seeking enlightenment, guiding the samurai on ethics of conduct and <br/>
self-improvement.<br/>
<br/>
With the restoration of power from the Shogun (military commander) to the <br/>
Emperor Meiji in the latter part of the 19th century, the samurai became a <br/>
relic of Japan�s ancient past. The Japanese people craved modernisation and <br/>
industrialisation equal to that of the western powers. This caused a decline <br/>
in the call for swords and the art of swordmaking was almost lost. In 1933, <br/>
Kurihara Hikosaburo, a keen sword enthusiast and a member of the National <br/>
diet, in an effort to save the craft, began a project to recruit and train <br/>
swordsmiths from all over Japan. The first member to sign up for this <br/>
project was Yoshihara Katsukichi, a toolmaker. Katsukichi would later to use <br/>
the art name Yoshihara Kuniie and become one of the most famous swordsmiths <br/>
of the Showa period (1926-1989). Swordmaking was once again threatened by <br/>
the allied occupation of Japan following WWII. All swordmaking and related <br/>
activities were banned during this time. Kurihara again spearheaded a <br/>
revival of the craft, but this time many of the smiths did not to return to <br/>
swordmaking, including Kuniie�s brother and son. Kuniie however, became one <br/>
of the pioneers of the post-war rebirth of Japanese swordmaking, leaving us <br/>
several prominent smiths as his legacy.<br/>
<br/>
Kuniie�s descendants continue to this day to produce Japanese swords in the <br/>
traditional manner. The exhibition displays examples of several generations <br/>
of his family and their former apprentices. The current head of the <br/>
Yoshihara school Kuniie�s grandson Yoshihara Yoshindo, (recently appointed <br/>
an Intangible Cultural Property of Tokyo) will be coming from Japan to open <br/>
the exhibition and give a talk on the opening day. Yoshindo�s younger <br/>
brother Shoji (Kuniie III), is the current deputy chairman of The All Japan <br/>
Swordsmiths Association and in 2004 had a cameo role in the Warner Brothers <br/>
movie The Last Samurai. Yoshihara Yoshikazu is Yoshindo�s son and the fourth <br/>
generation of Yoshihara smiths. In 2003 he became the youngest smith ever to <br/>
be elevated to the rank of mukansa (above competition level).<br/>
<br/>
The guest curator for the exhibition is Paul Martin, a former member of the <br/>
Japanese department of the British Museum in London - where he studied and <br/>
cared for the arms and armour collections. The former All England Karate <br/>
Champion currently lives in Japan where practices kendo and is furthering <br/>
his study of Japanese swords at national museums, shrines and at the <br/>
workshops of many of Japan�s top swordsmiths and sword polishers.</div>
