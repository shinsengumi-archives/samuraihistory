 <br/>
nice to see this group and the site, we the nairs of south India are <br/>
a warrior people from pre-colonial world, later subdued. there are <br/>
close parallels in many respects.<br/>
<br/>
we have a site, www.nairs.org which i myself put up, under <br/>
construction. it was Vasco da Gama's 1498 trip from Portugal to <br/>
Malabar, India (what Marco Polo the 12 th century traveler <br/>
called 'the richest and noblest country in the whole world') which <br/>
triggered the era of colonisation. what the western historians call <br/>
the finding of 'sea route to india' columbus ended up by mistake in <br/>
America, how the natives are still called indians, which saw the end <br/>
of the Aztecs, Mayans...<br/>
<br/>
how from a symbiotic culture an anti-nature paradigm took over <br/>
mankind, hope we can rebuild the planet by joining hands once again, <br/>
that the future generations have a better place to be in, for a new <br/>
world order<br/>
<br/>
those of you interested do get in touch<br/>
<br/>
thank you<br/>
