<h3>Shingen&#39;s Gekokujo</h3>
by <i>kitsuno</i>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1918092046">I have been researching exactly how Shingen overthrew his father, and <br/>
actually came up with two different versions of events.  <br/>
<br/>
The first version goes roughly like this:<br/>
<br/>
in the 5th month of 1541, Harunobu (shingen) and his father Nobutora <br/>
attack Unno Munetsuna in Shinano.  By the sixth month, the battle is <br/>
won, and Munetsuna flees the province.  They depart for Kai on 6/4, <br/>
and on the journey back, on 6/14, Shingen, along with his Ashigaru, <br/>
drive Nobutora off, and he was forced to flee to Imagawa Yoshimoto, <br/>
in Suruga (Yoshimoto was married to one of Nobutora's daughters).<br/>
<br/>
The second version goes like this:<br/>
<br/>
In the 6th month of 1541, Nobutora and Harunobu (shingen) went to <br/>
visit Nobutora's daughter, who was married to Imagawa Yoshimoto, in <br/>
Suruga province.  Little did Nobutora know, Yoshimoto and Shingen had <br/>
plotted against him. When they got there, Nobutora was forcibly <br/>
retired in favor of Shingen, and he was put under the "patronage" of <br/>
Yoshimoto.<br/>
<br/>
I am not sure why there are two versions, one seems to come from a <br/>
specific historical record, maybe the other comes from more than one <br/>
sources.  does anyone know which is more likely?</div>

          The second is the true one.I've read about it.Plus,the generals of Nobutora also helped Shingen.(they helped him because the generals saw Shingen was much more capable than his father;the siege against Hiraga Genshin's castle,Nobutora had a big army but Genshin's men drove them back although they were outnumbered.Shingen captured Hiraga Genshin's castle with only 300 men and a very simple method;he split his army into 3 parts and those 3 parts surrounded the castle.Genshin was unable to determine the number and he gave up without a fight.Shingen came back with Genshin's head but Nobutora criticized Shingen because he didn't stay at the castle.All the generals were completely stunned by Shingen's capabilities so that's how he gained they're good grace)<br/>
       Plus,Shingen was quite adopted by Yoshimoto.Nobutora was furious when he heard this.So he decided to get rid of Shingen.Yoshimoto and Shingen knew that he would come.After Nobutora finished his discussion with Yoshimoto,Nobutora was under house arrest.And when Shingen proclaimed himself the leadership of the Takeda clan,the generals(including Itakagi Nobutaka,Takasaka Masanobu,Baba Nobufusa,Yamamoto Kansuke,Takeda Nobushige.....) didn't move a finger.<br/>
       So that's how Shingen got the Takeda clan.<br/>

<h3>Ginkakuji</h3>
by <i>ltdomer98</i>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-408604219">I'd read previously, I believe in Sansom but not sure,<br/>
that the Ginkakuji was NOT ever supposed to be<br/>
actually covered in silver, but was simply referred to<br/>
as the Ginkaku (Silver Pavilion) to distinguish it<br/>
from the similiar Kinkaku (Golden Pavilion), which<br/>
actually IS covered in gold (though the covering of<br/>
the bottom floor is modern). <br/>
<br/>
I just received Turnbull's "War in Japan, 1467-1615",<br/>
and he asserts that the Ginkaku was supposed to be<br/>
covered in silver, but the turmoil of the Onin War<br/>
prevented that. <br/>
<br/>
Anyone have any better resources on this? Being as<br/>
it's Turnbull (and the man needs to get a decent<br/>
editor...criminy...in one photo caption he says that<br/>
Nobunaga's competing heirs were his brothers, when<br/>
they were his second and third son, as we all know.<br/>
I'll grant that he corrects himself in the text) I'm<br/>
inclined to go with Sansom, but I'd heard this alleged<br/>
before. <br/>
<br/>
Anyone?<br/>

was covered in gold--however, the bottom floor was not<br/>
covered in gold until it was rebuilt in the 1950's,<br/>
after burning down. <br/>

<h3>Re: Shingen&#39;s Gekokujo</h3>
by <i>kitsuno</i>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-2022257362">After researching Japanese sources for the past few days, it looks <br/>
like generally speaking, historians believe Yoshimoto had a hand in <br/>
it.  Apparently some Imagawa records mention it.  The Koyogunkan <br/>
basicaly says (and I am getting this from a source that quotes it, <br/>
not from the source itself - my copy of the KoyoGunKan is who knows <br/>
where....) that Nobutora plotted to dispose of Harunobu (shingen) and <br/>
have his second son Nobushige succeed him, however Harunobu found out <br/>
about the plot, and vassals loyal to him assisted in driving Nobutora <br/>
out, causing him to flee to Suruga.  Obviously, it doesnt mention <br/>
Imagawa's hand in the affair, but since the KoyoGunKan was written by <br/>
vassals of Shingen after his death, it makes sense that they would <br/>
want it to look like Shingen did it on his own.  The historical <br/>
records are obviously not very clear, but it seems safe to assume <br/>
that Yoshimoto had a hand in Shingen's succession to head of the <br/>
Takeda clan.<br/>

From the website you give:<br/>
"Plans to cover the pavilion in silver were never<br/>
realized."<br/>
<br/>
Can you confirm or deny? Is this just a commonly<br/>
believed rumor, perpetuated to highlight the poverty<br/>
and so forth of the Yoshimasa shogunate, or did they<br/>
really intend to cover it in silver and not make it?<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Okay, must have been somewhere besides Sansom. The<br/>
official website (linked off of the website Tony gave)<br/>
makes no mention at all of even why it's called the<br/>
Ginkakuji, or why it's not covered with silver. You'd<br/>
think the official website would address this, at<br/>
least the origin of the name. <br/>
<br/>
I know I've read in a reputable sources somewhere that<br/>
the Ginkaku was not actually supposed to be covered in<br/>
silver. The reasoning is that it was built in a<br/>
similiar style to the Kinkaku (it's uncanny how<br/>
similiar the actual pavilions themselves are), and so<br/>
was named such because it was just a contrast between<br/>
the two. <br/>
<br/>
While it seems to make sense that the reason was lack<br/>
of funds, etc., it just for some reason sticks in my<br/>
head as "too easy"...as something that one "expert"<br/>
said, and now everyone echoes them without really<br/>
looking into it. It really bothers me that the<br/>
Ginkakuji itself makes no mention of it. <br/>
<br/>
Oh well. <br/>
<br/>

 </span></blockquote>You might want to read 'Yoshimasa and the silver pavilion' by <br/>
Donald Keene (Columbia University Press). This book is about <br/>
(probably) the worst shogun in Japanese history, Ashikaga Yoshimasa, <br/>
who had a great impact on Japanese culture as it is known today. He <br/>
was a patron for many Japanese artists. Whether No, cha-no-yu, <br/>
calligraphy or Waka (for which Yoshimasa seems to have had a <br/>
talent). The book doesn't mention that the Ginkaku-ji was supposed <br/>
to be decorated (or covered) with silver. The name (according to <br/>
Keene) merely is a 'reference' (not sure about this term) to <br/>
Ashikaga Yoshimitsu's Kinkaku-ji.<br/>

During my last visit to Japan in January, I asked my wife to call <br/>
Ginkakuji and they said that yes, there were plans to cover it in <br/>
silver (and went on to give the standard background). This may be a <br/>

there are two theory which as to why ginkakuji not coating with silver.<br/>

one reason<br/>
<br/>
name of ginkakuji was used to from edo piriod, compre kinkakuji.<br/>
until edo piriod, they had not called it "ginkakuji"<br/>

silver.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>I agree. The ginkaku-ji wasn't meant to be covered in silver. The <br/>
name merely alludes to the Kinkaku-ji, that might explain the <br/>
misconception. Keene writes in his book about the personality of <br/>
Yoshimasa and the way it probably differed from Yoshimitsu's. The <br/>
latter wanted a building, the kinkaku-ji, that would perpetuate his <br/>
legacy through the centuries to come. Yoshimasa on the other hand, <br/>
above all, wanted a building that reflected his personal taste. He <br/>
planned it thoroughly and had special rocks and plants removed from <br/>
temples and palace gardens in order to enhance the beauty of his <br/>
gardens at Higashiyama. He had certain features and even whole <br/>
buildings deconstructed and reconstructed because he didn't like it.<br/>
There is only one known account, according to Keene (sounds like a <br/>
broken record :), that Yoshimasa expressed sadness and wonder about <br/>
the poverty of the commoners or the famines that plagued Japan <br/>
during his reign. In any case, it didn't stop him from building very <br/>
expensive palaces (if I remember correctly the Hana no gosho and <br/>
others) or organising Sakura (cherry tree) viewings. Above all, <br/>
Ginkaku-ji was his retreat to where he retired from his position as <br/>
shogun and only returned to politics (not as shogun but acting as <br/>
one) when his son the ninth Ashikaga shogun, Yoshihisa, died and he <br/>
had no heir. Yoshimasa was very much into 'karamono' (Chinese things <br/>
and objects of art). In my humble opinion this probably was a reason <br/>
that he didn't mind being a vassal of or paying tribute to the <br/>
Chinese emperor. The other reason was (again my opinion) that he <br/>
revered his grandfather Yoshimitsu and his father Yoshinori, who <br/>
both were 'King of Japan' and vassals of the Middle Kingdom. <br/>
<br/>
Maybe off-topic;<br/>
<br/>
A curious event happened in 1863 when: "Hatred of Yoshimitsu was <br/>
especially strong during the years immediately before the Meiji <br/>
restoration of 1868, which had as one of it's professed goals the <br/>
return of secular authority to the emperor. In the second month of <br/>
the third year of Bunkyu (1863), nine men, followers of the Shinto <br/>
zealot Hirata Atsutane, broke into the Toji-in [a temple in Kyoto] <br/>
and removed the heads of the statues of the first three Ashikaga <br/>
shoguns: Takauji, Yoshiakira and Yoshimitsu. They then exposed the <br/>
heads on a bank of the Kamo river, following the common practice at <br/>
this time of 'patriots' exposing for all to see the heads of men <br/>
accused of being traitors. Beside the heads of the three shogun, <br/>
placards were set up enumerating the crimes of each. Yoshimitsu's <br/>
acceptance of the title of King of Japan made him the worst traitor <br/>
of all." <br/>
<br/>

times perpetuate, depending on who you ask. Apparently<br/>
another poster got a different answer than I did. But,<br/>
I still believe it's simply a comparison between the<br/>

eyes of many Japanese, since he essentially<br/>
back-stabbed the imperial attempt to seize power from<br/>
the Kamakura bakufu. I do find it interesting that you<br/>
don't find any reference to Yoritomo's "head" being<br/>
stuck anywhere. <br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I can't quite understand why Takauji is thought of as such a villain. I<br/>
don't feel he ever really "back-stabbed" the imperial restoration. The<br/>
Kamakura Bakufu had grown weak and needed to be replaced, which Takauji<br/>
did, with a good deal of help from the Imperial Court & it's allies to<br/>
be fair... But after it was removed, Tajauji pretty much straight away<br/>
stepped in to the previous Bakufu's shoes and kept things moving much as<br/>
they had been before. It doesn't sound to me like he ever even pretended<br/>
to have any kind of Imperial restoration in mind, and I think most of<br/>
the other warriors around the nation also gave up on that idea pretty<br/>
quickly too, if they ever truly had it in the first place. It's not like<br/>
Go-Daigo proved to be any kind of great ruler or anything. The only<br/>
thing Go-Daigo and his administration seemed to do really well was anger<br/>
the warrior class...<br/>
