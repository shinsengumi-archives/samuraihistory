 </span></blockquote>The tea house in the picture has two doors, which are typical. <br/>
Normally they are both sliding doors, not swiging doors. It is hard to <br/>
tell from the picture but I would guess that there is a very low <br/>
chance that it's a swinging door.<br/>
<br/>
The tiny door that you mention is on the right-hand side of the <br/>
picture. It's knows as the "nijiri-guchi". This door is used by guests <br/>
at the time of the tea itself. You do have to crawl through it, <br/>
although crawl isn't precisely the right word. It's more like "slide <br/>
on one's knees while kneeling". The difference being that the posture <br/>
is kept upright when entering a tea house.<br/>
<br/>
The larger door on the left is called the "sadou-guchi". This is a <br/>
bigger (but still small) door that is used by the host. It's used from <br/>
time to time to carry things into and out of the tea house. It leads <br/>
into a small (as you can imagine) room at the back of the tea house <br/>
that holds all of the tools and materials needed to do tea.<br/>
