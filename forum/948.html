<h3>SAMURAI UNITS</h3>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1926822486">Hello all members on the forum!<br/>
<br/>
Could somebody please indicate where I could get meticulous order of <br/>
battles, if that does not work, how big are your Samurai wargame <br/>
units and how are they distributed?<br/>
<br/>
By the way, I'm as frustrated as Nuno on the use of Sashimono on <br/>
Ashigaru, Turnbull's books continously contradict themselves in this <br/>
respect -er, I know Tony Bryant's on this forum....his books are <br/>
great!;-)<br/>
<br/>
Happy holidays to you all!<br/>
<br/>
regards,<br/>
<br/>

 </span></blockquote>How's your Japanese? Most of the OBs are in Japanese, but there are a<br/>
lot of breakdowns of some of the more important Sengoku battles in the<br/>
various Killer Katana supplements. Worth a look, definitely. <br/>

The thing is, there's no real rule. Different clans operated<br/>
differently. If you believe samurai films, *everyone* wore sashimono<br/>
('cept the generals). My best guess is that nearly everyone did --<br/>
even if they were rather smaller banners.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1236792847">Hello Tony and fellow members,<br/>
<br/>
Ok, thanks Tony, but graphic evidence -Zôhyô Monogatari, amongst other primary sources, clearly indicate that the number of sashimono bearing Ashigaru is limited in comparison to Samurai....as for those Samurai films, I have even seen Ashigaru archers wearing sashimono which most students think impractical for bowmen! Still as I said, there are many books where the use of the afore-mentioned banners is confusing. <br/>
<br/>
Another thing which is unclear in many secondary sources is the use of Samurai cavalry. I have read that cavalry were actually supported by infantry reatiners so the tactical mobility enjoyed by say European cavalry was not an option, as Japanese cavalry units could not and did not want to outpace their foot element. Now I know Kurosawa portrayed some lovely cavalry charges in Ran but is the former assertion correct?<br/>
<br/>
I hope these doubts can be cleared. Thank you all.<br/>
<br/>
Regards,<br/>
Joe<br/>

<h3>Hi!!</h3>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-2119256906">Hi!!<br/>
Reading a biography of baba nobufusa i found that him suggested takeda katsuyori to stay on the other margin of the river at nagashino; I wonder, was this true?, and if it was so, could have this affected the outcome at nagashino?<br/>
Thanks!<br/>
