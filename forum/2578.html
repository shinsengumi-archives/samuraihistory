<h3>Yamada Nagamasa - info, if you can...</h3>
by <i>cepooooo</i>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1116096964">Hi gang. I am beginning a massive paper on Yamada Nagamasa, an <br/>
adventurer-merchant (and warrior) who lived and fought in Siam in the <br/>
early 17th.c. (his dates are ?-1630)<br/>
I found most of my sources in books related to Siamese History, but I <br/>
was wondering if you have any information on him, the Japanese in <br/>
Ayutthaya, and eventually other Japanese who lived in Southeast asia <br/>
(Hue, Manila, etc.) in this period.<br/>
If you can refer to any book or journal, that might really help. <br/>
material in japanese language is ok too.<br/>
Thanks a lot!!<br/>
Cepo, Honolulu</div>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1323957962">Hmmmm. We just had a similar discussion over at the Samurai History Forum;<br/>
so I might have given this info to you before.<br/>
<br/>
In English the only detailed work on Nagamasa and Japanese involvement in<br/>
Thailand/Siam I have found is;<br/>
"Notes on the Intercourse between Japan and Siam in the Seventeenth century"<br/>
by Ernest M Satow, Transactions of the Asiatic Society of Japan, Vol. 13, pt<br/>
II, pages 139-210<br/>
<br/>
In Japanese there are oodles but the only thing I have is volume 140 of the<br/>
Visual Nihon Rekishi Series by DeAgustini on Nagamasa.<br/>
<br/>
I hope this helps.</div>
