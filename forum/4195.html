<h3>Samurai History Journal</h3>
by <i>kitsuno</i>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1077137994">Here is something that people here might be interested in:<br/>
<br/>
Ridgeback Press is pleased to announce the publication of a new <br/>
innovative quarterly -- Samurai History Journal (available in both <br/>
electronic and printed editions). Samurai History Journal, edited by <br/>
Romulus Hillsborough, is the only magazine in English focusing on the <br/>
history and culture of the great men of the Meiji Restoration (1853-<br/>
1868: the last fifteen years of the samurai era). <br/>
<br/>
The Meiji Restoration has often been neglected and/or misrepresented <br/>
by writers of the English language. When this history has been <br/>
represented seriously and accurately, it has generally been in a dry <br/>
academic format. Through articles and essays by distinguished history <br/>
writers and novelists in Japan, it is the purpose of Samurai History <br/>
Journal to present this most fascinating period in Japanese history, <br/>
and the humanity of the men who made this history, accurately and <br/>
realistically, in a vivid literary format which will at once educate <br/>
and entertain.<br/>
<br/>
More information about Samurai History Journal is available at <br/>

cover the whole history of the Samurai.<br/>
<br/>
If you are listening Tony, I know you have had some experience in this<br/>
field, any suggestions?</div>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1074532301">It's an awesome idea, and timing is perfect.<br/>
I'd really love to be involved. I know many graduate students in the <br/>
field, and a bunch of professors, including Varley, Friday, Hurst and <br/>
Farris. Uh, and I know a bit Bryant too :oP<br/>
If it's a serious project, they might be interested, perhaps.<br/>

enthusiasm; then #2 gets a bit harder; and #3... mmmhhhh... sorry I'm <br/>
busy at home recently; #4.... awww I study Chinese history now... :o)<br/>
