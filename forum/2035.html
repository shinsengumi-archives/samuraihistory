<h3>URGENT NOTICE TO AUSTRALIAN COLLECTORS - ALL SWORDS TO BE BANNED</h3>
by <i>Barry Thomas</i>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-162890173">Dear Friends in Nihont么 and Samurai study,<br/>
<br/>
The Victorian Government has given notice that it intends to declare ALL SWORDS<br/>
to be prohibited weapons.  All sorts of nasty consequences flow from this<br/>
including import bans.  A Regulatory Impact Statement (RIS) is available by mail<br/>
or via the Justice Department's website.  I urge all Australian collectors to<br/>
request a hard copy by mail and/or download the documents and read them<br/>
thoroughly.  Submissions close on Monday September 8th.<br/>
<br/>
This is particularly important for ALL Australian collectors.  I believe that<br/>
any law passed in any State jurisdiction can then be immediately written into<br/>
law WITHOUT PUBLIC CONSULTATION by any other State.  As the proposed banning of<br/>
swords arises out of an all-Australian Police Commissioners meeting you may be<br/>
sure that if this gets up in Victoria we will see swords declared prohibited<br/>
weapons without notice all over Australia.<br/>
<br/>
Any lover of swords anywhere in the world is also quite free to download the RIS<br/>
and make a submission to the Victorian Government.  I would be eternally<br/>
grateful to anyone who did so and the cause of Nihont么 as Art swords will surely<br/>
be advanced.  Important swords have been found in Australia and will continue to<br/>
be found - unless they wind up being broken and melted down.<br/>
<br/>
Calling Colonel Cadwell, where are you.<br/>
<br/>
I will try to set something up on a website - Richard Turner??<br/>

Dear Friends in Nihont么 and Samurai study,<br/>
<br/>
The Victorian Government has given notice that it intends to declare ALL<br/>
SWORDS<br/>
to be prohibited weapons.  All sorts of nasty consequences flow from<br/>
this<br/>
including import bans.  A Regulatory Impact Statement (RIS) is available<br/>
by mail<br/>
or via the Justice Department's website.  I urge all Australian<br/>
collectors to<br/>
request a hard copy by mail and/or download the documents and read them<br/>
thoroughly.  Submissions close on Monday September 8th.<br/>
<br/>
This is particularly important for ALL Australian collectors.  I believe<br/>
that<br/>
any law passed in any State jurisdiction can then be immediately written<br/>
into<br/>
law WITHOUT PUBLIC CONSULTATION by any other State.  As the proposed<br/>
banning of<br/>
swords arises out of an all-Australian Police Commissioners meeting you<br/>
may be<br/>
sure that if this gets up in Victoria we will see swords declared<br/>
prohibited<br/>
weapons without notice all over Australia.<br/>
<br/>
Any lover of swords anywhere in the world is also quite free to download<br/>
