<h3>Prelim thought - S-A Japanese History Journal</h3>

<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-193337054">I've already posted this to the forum, but I want to get feedback here<br/>
as well, since there are a lot more members. I am considering<br/>
(seriously considering) publishing a quarterly Japanese history<br/>
journal. The main issue to address, aside from wondering if anyone<br/>
would even want to buy it, is, I would need to gather enough articles<br/>
to constitute a bi-yearly or quarterly journal.  So these are the<br/>
initial questions:<br/>
<br/>
1. If the S-A published a history journal (actual paperback high<br/>
quality books), with 4-6 articles, probably totalling 80-120 pages,<br/>
would you consider buying/subscribing?<br/>
2. Is there anyone who would be interested in actually contributing<br/>
articles? (I would have a set of requirements TBD)<br/>
<br/>
All of the details are TBD (To Be Decided), I'm just testing the<br/>
waters here. I would aim for between 8-16 articles a year (the number<br/>
of articles would determine the number of issues) and would set an<br/>
estimated target of between 25-60 pages per article, and an assortment<br/>
of other requirements. Basically it would be in official book form,<br/>
with issues available to purchase online via amazon.com,<br/>
barnesandnoble.com etc., or if I decide to offer a subscription, it<br/>
would be available for a discount.<br/>
<br/>
So, thoughts?</div>

I would definitely consider subscribing to such a journal. I would be  <br/>
willing to contribute, though I probably don't have appropriate credentials -- I  am <br/>
not a historian, I'm a computer programmer by trade. So my efforts are  <br/>
stricly on the amateur level. My only other possible credentials is that I  studied <br/>
kendo for ten years.<br/>

Whether or not I am qualified to write an article for such a journal, that<br/>
is an entirely different question. Like Nina, and perhaps many others on the<br/>

<br/>

One other question: have you considered how and S-A quarterly might be<br/>
similar or different from Monumenta Nipponica or the Journal of Japanese<br/>
Studies? Have you given any thought to what niche S-A quarterly might occupy<br/>
to differentiate itself from those journals?<br/>

In any case, kudos to you for the idea. <br/>

<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Good points and good questions.  First off - (and I need to make this<br/>
clear) - "Academic Journals" essentially *will not* publish you, no<br/>
matter the level of your scholarship, unless you have some academic<br/>
credentials to back up your name. Which I think you know means that<br/>
neither I, nor F.Seal, nor anyone else associated with the samurai<br/>
archives could ever hope to get published.  I'm subversively<br/>
undercutting that bias by allowing anyone with the theories, ideas,<br/>
and ability to make for a well written, academically sound, and<br/>
interesting research to be published. So above all else, I want it<br/>
understood that I really don't care if someone lacks (or has) a PhD or<br/>
MA after thier name if they can put together a good paper. The best I<br/>
can personally do is put "MBA" after my name, and that surely doesn't<br/>
qualify *me* as a historian.  This would be a journal of independent<br/>
scholarship, and that's my intention.  I do know a couple people<br/>
actually qualified in the academic sense who have shown interest, but<br/>
that most definately *doesn't* exclude anyone who doesn't.<br/>
<br/>
As for "how does this stand apart"? - my aim is to focus more on the<br/>
military history, and the personalities of Japanese history, rather<br/>
than social issues, "intellectual history", and how (for example)<br/>
Daimyo administered thier lands, and all of the other stuff that is<br/>
the vogue of the academic journals. I want to publish the stuff that<br/>
people want to read, not the stuff that you are forced to write if you<br/>
want to get into an academic journal.  I have the business background,<br/>
so I'm already in the process of building the business foundation. <br/>
All that will be left are the articles themselves.<br/>
<br/>
I am giving myself 4 months to organize the business side, as well as<br/>
organize the potential editors and the "checklist", if you will, of<br/>
the formats, expectations, and requirements, and my goal is to have<br/>
the articles ready to go in a minimum of 6 months from now.  I already<br/>
know how to go about publishing and distributing, so that monster is<br/>
already in it's cage. I'll probably create a seperate group or forum<br/>
for people interested in discussing the requirements of publication<br/>
(how to format it correctly, what sources are and are not acceptable,<br/>
etc.), so if/when I do that, I'll let you know, but anyone interested<br/>
in helping out in any capacity, let me know. I'm going to need a basic<br/>
support structure (editors, fact checkers, grammar nazis) on the one<br/>
hand, and writers on the other.  I have no doubts this can work, and I<br/>
already know the costs involved, the main thing again will be "you",<br/>
the writers and researchers.<br/>
<br/>
So, again, don't let something so small as a few letters after your<br/>
name dissuade you - Einstein didn't have a PhD when he came up with<br/>
the theory of relativity.</div>

 </span></blockquote>Also, I am more than willing on a one on one email basis, to discuss<br/>
with each person what they may be interested in tackling - everyone<br/>
has a particular niche of thier own that they have a great deal of<br/>
knowledge about, and I'm interested in tapping that.  I am equipped to<br/>
assist in research, and recomending sources, and I have the insanely<br/>
immense University of Hawaii's Japanese history section at my<br/>
disposal.  And no one should worry about thier writing ability or<br/>
grammar - my punctuation and sentence structure is pretty sub par, but<br/>
that's what editors are for, and I'm sure it won't be a problem to<br/>
find people willing to help out with that side of things. This is a<br/>
pretty grand idea, but it is also doable, provided I can gather 10-20<br/>
articles to comprise the first "year" of issues.</div>
