<h3>Announcement - The Samurai Archives Journal of Japanese History</h3>
by <i>kitsuno</i>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-2100426669">A month or two ago I announced the planned creating of a history<br/>
journal.  It is moving along, and the webpage will be finished within<br/>
the next few weeks.  So, I'm announcing here first that I am now<br/>
accepting submissions.  The format for articles will generally follow<br/>
the Monumenta Nipponica stylesheet:<br/>
<br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://monumenta.cc.sophia.ac.jp/submissions.html">http://monumenta.cc.sophia.ac.jp/submissions.html</a><br/>
<br/>
Although with some minor changes that will be covered in the webpage.<br/>
 Also, as I mentioned before, although we encourage students and<br/>
academic scholars of Japanese history to submit articles for the<br/>
journal, academic affiliation is by no means a requirement.   Here is<br/>
the preliminary (in other words, rough draft) statement on the home<br/>
page of the journal website.  Feel free to post or email me with any<br/>
questions.  We'll also be looking for anyone willing to make donations<br/>
to help fund the journal, but regardless, I'm moving forward with it.<br/>
 Thanks to the people who are helping me along with all this.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
The Samurai Archives Journal of Japanese History is a new journal<br/>
devoted to the critical examination of the events and personalities of<br/>
pre-20th century Japan.<br/>
<br/>
The goals of the Journal are to:<br/>
<br/>
# Encourage new and established scholars to share their research, as<br/>
well as to give independent scholars a forum for their work<br/>
# To introduce readers to the wealth of material available in Japanese<br/>
and English<br/>
# To encourage interest and informed discussion on the topic of<br/>
Japanese history<br/>
<br/>
The journal is tentatively scheduled for publication in early 2008,<br/>
and is currently accepting submissions.<br/>
<br/>
Although the general focus of the journal is on military history and<br/>
biography, articles dealing with all periods and subjects of Japanese<br/>
history are welcomed; we demand only solid scholarship, clear writing<br/>
and original ideas. Writers may approach their subjects from whichever<br/>
field or discipline they wish.<br/>
<br/>
For several years the Samurai Archives has been the most comprehensive<br/>
and widely recognized source of Japanese history in English on the<br/>
internet. This print journal will draw on the resources of the website<br/>
and the talents of its members as well as the scholarship of other<br/>
contributors to present an authoritative and entertaining quarterly on<br/>
this fascinating subject.</div>

<br/>
This sounds like an interesting project, however I have a few questions:<br/>
<br/>
1) Will it be a print publication?<br/>
<br/>
2) Will it be peer-reviewed?<br/>
<br/>
3) Why have a new journal in addition to Monumenta Nipponica?</div>

><br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>1) Yes.<br/>
<br/>
2) Depends on the definition of "peer review" (The technically correct<br/>
answer is probably "no") - I will have a staff of readers, fact<br/>
checkers, and editors, and critical examinations and rebuttals are<br/>
welcome - some of them will have degrees in Japanese history.  I have<br/>
no university affiliation, so I have no "colleagues" to call on. Also,<br/>
I am putting special and hard emphasis on quality sources and<br/>
references.  The sources an article are based on will be evaluated as<br/>
well as the article itself.<br/>
<br/>
3) Covered this in an old post, but only established PhDs can get<br/>
published in Monumenta Nipponica - I can't, and I don't know anyone<br/>
personally who can.  It will be a forum for independent scholars as<br/>
well as academic scholars.  Also, to put it simply (the old post goes<br/>
into greater detail) - this would be purely a "history" journal,<br/>
pre-20th century narrative history, biography, military, events.  Most<br/>
Japan related journals don't cover "just" history.  The goal is to<br/>
develop something interesting, readable, and useful for research.  The<br/>
quality of writing, and veracity of ideas is more important than a PhD<br/>
or lack thereof.  But I am also not disallowing any subjects related<br/>
to Japanese history - anything regarding pre-20th century Japan will<br/>
be evaluated on a case-by-case basis.<br/>
<br/>
I call it a "journal", but the reality is that they will essentially<br/>
be books, more similar to a multi-volume set than a journal as far as<br/>
execution goes.<br/>
<br/>
Not to mention, a print publication is the next logical step for the<br/>
Samurai Archives, which is one of the main reasons I am moving forward<br/>
with this.</div>

 </span></blockquote>Because not all of us are PhD's who can get published<br/>
in MN. That doesn't mean there isn't good work to be<br/>
had out there. <br/>
<br/>
This certainly won't compete with MN. <br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Questions like this are probably best sent directly to<br/>
Kitsuno (<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="mailto:webmaster@...">webmaster@...</a>), but I can<br/>
answer for him that those would likely be fine,<br/>
assuming they haven't been previously published. Your<br/>
submission would be by email, so we could format it<br/>
for the journal.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>As long as it hasn't been published before, that's fine. The website<br/>
covers most of the important details, although I will have to update<br/>
it to say that anything not previously published is fine.</div>
