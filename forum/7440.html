Gentlemen<br/>
I have just received notice of a seminar regarding conservation and <br/>
preservation of Japanese arms and armour to be held on Wednesday 17th <br/>
August at The Royal Armouries in Leeds. Also there will be a talk on <br/>
"Reading Japanese inscriptions". This is again held in conjunction <br/>
with the SHOGUN exhibition in conjunction with the Nikko Toshogu <br/>
Shrine.<br/>
As museums are notoriously bad at the very specialised conservation <br/>
and restoration of Japanese swords, with very few knowledgable <br/>
experts in the field, it may be interesting to hear what they have to <br/>
say, so I am considering attending.<br/>
For further info and to reserve a place, the tel no. is 0113 220 1985 <br/>
from the UK.<br/>
Regards<br/>
Clive Sinclaire</div>

 </span></blockquote>Bearing in mind that the person largely responsible for the exhibition <br/>
is Ian Bottomley, the available knowledge in this case is probably <br/>
quite good. There were one or two factual errors in the main exhibition <br/>
itself, however.</div>
