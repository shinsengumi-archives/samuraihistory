<h3>Re: Samurai sword</h3>
by <i>thomas5403</i>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1461350727">That depends who's showing, who's asking, why and when. As <br/>
someone else as said, I doubt if samurai were in the habit of <br/>
showing swords to each other. In the Civil War era you were <br/>
never sure who you could trust, and in the Edo period you were <br/>
never sure how someone might react from what you say.<br/>
<br/>
To offer a quick paraphrase, one man offered a compliment <br/>
regarding the other's blade, but the other guy took it as a <br/>
veiled jibe, "are you implying that I am not man enough for<br/>
this blade!" The next moment they're killing each other.<br/>
<br/>
There are strict rules of ettiquette with regard to the <br/>
handling of swords taught in the martial ryu, not the least <br/>
because there's always the chance that when you show someone <br/>
your sword he then kills you with it.<br/>
<br/>
An example:<br/>
<br/>
The two men are kneeling opposite each other. The man passing <br/>
the sword holds it horizontally, blade towards himself, one <br/>
hand on the scabbard and one on the hilt.<br/>
<br/>
As he passes it, the receiver also takes a grip of both <br/>
scabbard and hilt, and rolls the blade edge inward towards <br/>
himself as he takes it.<br/>
<br/>
* * *<br/>
<br/>
This is founded on the principle that:<br/>
a - if you hand a sword over holding just the scabbard, the <br/>
receiver can grab the hilt, draw the blade and cut you. You can <br/>
do likewise to him as he receives it.<br/>
<br/>
b - if you hold just the hilt, the scabbard might slip off <br/>
(although the fit should be sufficient to prevent this <br/>
happening - they do wear in time, and worse things have <br/>
happened).<br/>
<br/>
Likewise turning the blade edge towards oneself means it is <br/>
harder to draw (because of the curve), and the blade edge is <br/>
not pointing at the other guy (plain good manners).<br/>
<br/>
Apart from that, it's purely a matter of politeness. It's <br/>
impolite to point a drawn blade at someone, or its edge, in any <br/>
country. Swords are sharp and can cut, and for this reason <br/>
alone should be treated with respect. Imagine someone <br/>
showing you his gun by pointing it at your face!<br/>

<h3>Re: Samurai sword</h3>
by <i>midorinotoradesu</i>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1502703175">Tony,<br/>
I was just thinking about all the samurai swords that are in museums <br/>
and in great condition.  I've heard that european blades are <br/>
difficult to come by in good condition due to oxidation from constant <br/>
handling.  <br/>
I had heard the similar story about the samurai sword only being <br/>
drawn to taste blood... so I'm curious, as this was the explaination <br/>
(albiet misinformed) for the condition of samurai swords.<br/>
I do realize that the samurai regaurded their blades more highly than <br/>
any European blade (even x-caliber).  The famous grass cutter and <br/>
other blades are the holy grails of Samurai Myth & Legend.  I also <br/>
know that if a blade is inspected they have a very special method <br/>
(almost cermonial) to preserve the blade after inspection.  <br/>
Can you tell us exaclty why Samurai blades have survived so long with <br/>
so little oxidation?  Or you can tell me that I'm on crack and <br/>
everything I just said was also misinformed.  You are the expert.  I <br/>
trust anything you would tell us more than any other western souce.  <br/>
Thanks.<br/>

needed if you lived in a coastal city Edo or Kamakura,<br/>
the samurai I think cleaned his blade twice a week to<br/>

Examination of the blade was supposedly performed according to strict<br/>
rules of etiquette whereby the blade was withdrawn from the scabbard<br/>
by degrees. The procedure is described in more detail in Nitobe's famous<br/>
work, "Bushido."<br/>
<br/>
Cleaning the blade required complete removal from the scabbard, followed<br/>
by application of a light powder (uchigo), which was then cleaned away <br/>
with a soft<br/>
rice paper, or sometimes with silk. Finally a very fine coat of oil of <br/>
cloves<br/>
(choji abura) would be applied to the steel with a clean cloth.<br/>

armour and weapons to temples and shrines, who then preserved the offerings.<br/>
Europe had no such tradition that protected things. If things in Europe<br/>

<h3>Re: [samuraihistory] Re: Samurai sword</h3>
by <i>herbertlison</i>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-2081884826">Tony's comments strike me as inaccurate, with regards to both European <br/>
and Japanese<br/>
attitudes toward swords.<br/>
<br/>
Both cultures regarded the sword as the knightly weapon, par excellence. <br/>
 In Japan the<br/>
sword had additional signficance, in part, I suspect, because a sword <br/>
was one of the<br/>
three Imperial regalia, and thus had mystical and semi-religious overtones.<br/>
<br/>
The samurai class in Japan constituted a much greater percentage of the <br/>
population<br/>
than the knightly class did in Europe.  Consequently there were a lot <br/>
more swords<br/>
made and a lot more survived.   The notion that the Europeans had no <br/>
notion of<br/>
"protecting things" is simply not true. There are still fabulous collections<br/>
of medieval weapons all over Europe in museums and private hands.  <br/>
<br/>
The habit of carrying swords in the west, medieval or not, only ended <br/>
about 150<br/>
years ago.   Officers in the Civil War carried swords and used them.   When<br/>
the Queen of Holland gave General Eisenhower a token of her country's <br/>
esteem,<br/>
it was a highly decorated sword, not a machine gun.<br/>
<br/>
Swordmaking in Japan was a major art form, and is still practiced by <br/>
numerous<br/>
individuals, some of whom have been designated "Living National <br/>
Treasures" by<br/>
the Japanese government.  The skill required to forge a samurai sword <br/>
staggers<br/>
one's imagination, and requires many years to master.   The allied art <br/>
of making<br/>
the sword fittings is also astounding in its complexity.    The great <br/>
names of the<br/>
sword art are as important culturally in Japan as Rembrandt and Picasso are<br/>
in the west.  A recent exhibition of the swords of Masamune, perhaps the<br/>
greatest of all swordsmiths, drew record crowds at the Tokugawa Art Museum<br/>
in Nagoya.<br/>
<br/>
There are now numerous books available in English for westerners interested<br/>
in the Japanese sword.   I would be glad to post a bibliography of such <br/>
items<br/>
if there are sufficient requests.   A good book for beginners is John <br/>
Yumoto's<br/>
classic work, "The Samurai Sword, A Handbook" published by Tuttle.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>I've heard that some of the iron used in constructing the swords was <br/>
high in nickel which would certainly help make swords made from it more <br/>
corrosion resistant. However note that even stainless steel rusts if <br/>
it's not cared for, it's just a slower process than pure high carbon <br/>
steels. I wouldn't call this a secret of this period, it wasn't really <br/>
until the late 19th and early 20th century that people understood why <br/>
certain iron ores had superior characteristics for certain applications. <br/>
Being high in nickel is not necessarily a good characteristic, most <br/>
stainless steels are inferior in edge holding characteristics compared <br/>
to pure high carbon steels which is why most good carpenter tools are <br/>
still made from it.<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Again, I'm talking about specifically taking care of swords. How many European swords from the 1300s have a mirror polish on them? There are hundreds of Japanese swords of this age that do. There's a<br/>
difference between stashing them somewhere for safekeeping, and keeping them in a treasure house and cleaning them periodically.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> > There are still fabulous collections<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Yes, I've seen quite a few. But in terms of numbers, they're still lower (percentage, by date) than those in Japan, and in less good condition. How often do swords in Japan get classified from a battlefield<br/>
find? Not too often, but many of the examples that Oakenshott and others use to classify types are dug up out of the ground and need to be conserved, rather than preserved.<br/>

><br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Again, I'm talking "knightly swords" not modern swords. The way we regard them and still use them (e.g., still in today's army and so forth we have officers' dress swords) is irrelevant to a discussion of<br/>
historical knightly swords. Comparing these to Japanese swords is apples and oranges; better to compare those to gunto<br/>
