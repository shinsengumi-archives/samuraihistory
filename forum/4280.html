<div id="ygrps-yiv-914101380">This is probably outside the range this group is interested in, <br/>
however I seem to have run out of steam charging my samurai up and <br/>
down the foam hills and refighting the battles leading up to the <br/>
formation of the shogunate. I'd like to try to do something else for <br/>
a change of pace.<br/>
<br/>
In 1877 Saigö Takamori led his remaining 40 samurai (which once <br/>
numbered over 12,000) against the new Japanese Imperial army and <br/>
into the movies in 2003.<br/>
<br/>
The Japanese Imperial army of that period was dressed in French <br/>
Garde Mobile style uniforms. Japanese infantrymen wore a dark blue <br/>
kepi, a short jacket with French style field pack, and dark blue <br/>
pants. The cavalry wore red kepis with a small white plume in the <br/>
front, dark blue jackets, red pants with a yellow stripe, and black <br/>
boots. Their lance pennants were red over white.<br/>
<br/>
What would you recommend for 28mm figures to represent the Japanese <br/>
Imperial army? I'd like to build this army to fight against my <br/>
existing samurai army. It would be an interesting game.</div>

 </span></blockquote>Useless trivia:<br/>
<br/>
It appears that his real name was not in fact Saigo Takamori. <br/>
Takamori was his father's name; his name was Takanaga.<br/>
<br/>
There are at least 2 versions of the story as to how this came about. <br/>
My preferred version of the story goes that he was going to obtain <br/>
some rank and was to be sent a certificate by the emperor. He was <br/>
unavailable and a friend of his was asked to confirm the name that <br/>
should be used on the certificate. The friend misremembered the name <br/>
and gave the father's name instead: "Saigo Takamori". This was <br/>
probably due to the fact that given names were hardly used. If a <br/>
"name" was used at all (instead of a title) it was probably a <br/>
nickname. Saigo's nickname was "Kichi-no-suke".<br/>
<br/>
When Saigo got the (incorrect) certificate, he apparently just went <br/>
with the flow and from then on used "Takamori" instead of his given <br/>
name, Takanaga.<br/>

<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
--> My first thought would be to suggest some of the foundry ranges, to see<br/>
if anything can be converted but Old Glory would also be well worth checking<br/>
out. I am sure its possible to convert the miniatures if no range is aleady<br/>
available.<br/>
<br/>
There has been "talk" from several companies of them doing a range and there<br/>
may be other companies who have something more suitable availalbe already,<br/>
check the internet or wargames press.<br/>
<br/>
I have a book on the period at home which is excellant and contains a lot of<br/>
detail so the reference material is available if a company decided to do a<br/>
range, and I am sure someone will, movies tend to have that knock on effect!<br/>
<br/>
Apologies that the information is not that helpful but I will do some more<br/>
investigation as I get time during the week, and see if I can find out if a<br/>
specific range is out there.<br/>
<br/>
What manufacturers do you use for your existing Samurai army?<br/>
<br/>
