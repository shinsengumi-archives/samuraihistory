<h3>Saya clashing</h3>
by <i>thomas5403</i>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-443177609">Hi Nate, and everyone:<br/>
<br/>
Clashing saya was a definite no-no and considered a challenge, <br/>
and a challenge could never be refused.<br/>
<br/>
Here's an example:<br/>
<br/>
In 1630 Maeda Higo, grandson of Toshiie, was crossing a bridge <br/>
with some friends when they met two samurai, Murase and Sakabe, <br/>
coming the other way. Higo and Sakabe's saya bumped together <br/>
accidentally as they passed. Higo slapped Sakabe's shoulder <br/>
with his fan, and Sakabe drew his sword 'with a shout'. Higo's <br/>
friends rallied to his cause, and soon Sakabe and Murase were <br/>
killed.<br/>
<br/>
Hearing the news Murase's father rushed to the scene with sword <br/>
in hand and killed two of Higo's retainers and injured a third <br/>
before he was himself cut down. Sakabe's father came armed with <br/>
a spear, but the press of the crowd prevented him from getting <br/>
close enough to get involved.<br/>
<br/>
The incident was reported to Lord Maeda, but no-one was <br/>
punished. Sakabe's father, ashamed of his failure to exact <br/>
revenge, left the city and entered the priesthood.<br/>
<br/>
Higo apparently lived the rest of his life in constant fear of <br/>
revenge.<br/>
(from 'Taming of the Samurai' by Eiko Ikegami)<br/>
<br/>
Another example shows the stupid lengths peacetime samurai <br/>
would go to to protect their pride and prove their courage. <br/>
Unfortunately I can't recall the source, and have forgotten the <br/>
names of those involved, however:<br/>
<br/>
Two samurai passed on a staircase in (I believe) Edo Castle. <br/>
Their sayas clashed as they did so, and each turned angrily on <br/>
the other.<br/>
<br/>
Here's the dilemma: The affront demands instant retribution, <br/>
but the guy going up the stairs is delivering a message to his <br/>
master - if he gets involved in a fight he's placing his own <br/>
interests before his lord's, and that carries the death <br/>
penalty. If the guy coming down cuts down the man going up, he <br/>
is then preventing someone carrying out his master's business, <br/>
so both men are caught on the same point.<br/>
<br/>
The simple solution was to arrange a duel at a time convenient <br/>
to both - but that's not what happened.<br/>
<br/>
What actually happened is that the guy coming down, determined <br/>
to show he was not afraid to die, 'right here, right now,' as <br/>
it were, drew his sword and killed himself.<br/>
<br/>
The guy going up, not to be outdone, continued up, delivered <br/>
his message, then came back down and he too killed himself on <br/>
the same spot!<br/>
<br/>
The Tokugawa problem was how to maintain the 'spirit of the <br/>
samurai' as an ideal, which demands instant response to any <br/>
quarrel (kenka), no matter its cause, whilst keeping the peace <br/>
by a law called kenka ryoseibai, which demanded equally severe <br/>
punishment for both parties.<br/>
<br/>
It was a real mess, never fully resolved, and aggravated by the <br/>
fact that the Tokugawa bureaucracy was notoriously uneven and <br/>
indecisive when making decisions with regard to duels and <br/>
vendettas. Sometimes men were beheaded for NOT getting involed <br/>
in fights, which was seen as dishonouring their status as <br/>
samurai, other times men were beheaded for getting involved <br/>
when they should have practiced restraint.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1251468097">yeah, samurai in peace time were what we would call<br/>
"hot heads" <br/>
<br/>
They simply were not prepared for peaceful life, they<br/>
and there ancestors had been fighting wars for almost<br/>
their entire lives. But suddenly, along comes the<br/>
Tokugawa and theirs no one left to fight anymore.<br/>
<br/>
Compared to western civilisation in the 16th century,<br/>
Japan was immensly "civilised", but how civilised is<br/>
it to massacare a group of people for bumping into<br/>
you, or being rude.<br/>
<br/>
In a world like that, you can imagine how importan<br/>
"manners" were.<br/>
