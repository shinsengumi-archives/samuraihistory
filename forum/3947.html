><br/>
 </span></blockquote>I agree that's a tough question, it wouldn't be irrational to claim that <br/>
Japan wasn't a nation until Meiji forced it to become one. It had no <br/>
national army or many of the other characteristics of the nations of <br/>
Europe or later on of the Americas You could look at the Edo jidai as <br/>
one long occupation by an invading force for half of the country.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>I think the Korean navy might disagree with that. The Japanese did great <br/>
on land, but failed horribly at sea against Korean naval forces. I <br/>
suspect the Korean peasants and commoners didn't welcome them either.     <br/>

 </span></blockquote>Why sadly? He was definitely an interesting character and he left some <br/>
good paintings behind! I have to ask my freshly arrived who the most <br/>
famous American historic character in Japan, I think the answer will be <br/>
a bit scary. Of course some of my favorite Americans are among the <br/>
founding fathers, the wierdest group ever assembled I think in part <br/>
because America was the first place in the West that ordinary people <br/>
could rise to the top without any form of nobility baggage. So all the <br/>
nuts and flakes came and then continued west ;)<br/>

 </span></blockquote>I'm grateful that it's published as that in English since it means cheap <br/>
copies everywhere, but I always laugh at the though of it as a business <br/>
manual. Prabably better than anything coming out of Harvard though.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>What's more important, it was translated into English!  You can't say is <br/>
unpopular in Japan, so he appeals to a wide range of people. Besides do <br/>
fanboys read ^_^ Though in some ways he's more like Billy the Kid or <br/>
some Hollywood cowboy hero in some ways.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>       Never heard of him.  I've only been a fan of ozumo for about a year <br/>
and a half (since Kyushu 2k2, when Asashoryu began the final stage of his run to <br/>
the top).  My favourites became, and remain, Ozeki Kaio, Georgian Maegashira <br/>
Kokkai, Russian Juryo Roho and (now) the Yokozuna, the aforementioned <br/>
Asashoryu.  And yeah, I'm having a whole lot of fun with this basho!  :-D  Take care.  <br/>
