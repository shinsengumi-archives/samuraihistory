"Mythical Medieval Japan never seemed so attractive as in this breezy <br/>
epic... a rousingly muscular piece of romantic adventure, replete with <br/>
shadowy assassins, fluttering battle flags, and doomed love." <br/>
                   --Kirkus Reviews<br/>

   Greetings from Penguin Putnam, <br/>
<br/>
   We at Riverhead Books and Penguin Putnam are proud to announce the <br/>
publication of Lian Hearn's Across the Nightingale Floor on August <br/>
26th.<br/>
<br/>
   This critically acclaimed first book of The Otori Trilogy is a <br/>
fantasy novel set in ancient Japan.  Lian Hearn is a pseudonym.  She <br/>
studied at Oxford University and has had a lifelong interest in <br/>
Japanese culture and history.<br/>
<br/>
   Hearn's exhilarating epic is alive with sorcery, sword fights, <br/>
samurai, rival clans and martial arts as well as the passion of first <br/>
love.  It appeals to a wide variety of readers and has been <br/>
enthusiastically received worldwide, with publishing rights sold in 25 <br/>
foreign markets and film rights optioned to Kathleen Kennedy and Frank <br/>
Marshall for Universal.  <br/>
<br/>
   We invite you to read about this book and to share it with your <br/>
readership. We plan to launch a website at www.theotori.com that will <br/>
include information about the book and its characters."</div>
