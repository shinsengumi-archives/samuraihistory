Thanks a lot for taking the time to respond.  The comment was intended to be <br/>
in general.  My own research interests have been largely in the later Age of <br/>
the Country at War, and therefore my knowledge of weaponry specifically relates <br/>
to that era.  I will certainly look more deeply into Kamakura weaponry,  and <br/>
I look forward to any further thoughts you share on this topic.  Thanks, <br/>
Professor Murphy<br/>
