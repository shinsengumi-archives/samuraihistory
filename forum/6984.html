<br/>
This guy has been around for several years--every so<br/>
often he comes back and tries his luck again. HE'S A<br/>
SCAM ARTIST. DO NOT WASTE YOUR TIME EMAILING HIM! As<br/>
CEPO said, he's baaack....when someone posts that, it<br/>
should be a clue to you that we've dealt with him<br/>
before. Anyone stop to think why he emailed you<br/>
individually? It's because he CANNOT post on the<br/>
list--us moderator types will immediately delete his<br/>
email and ban him, AGAIN. <br/>
<br/>
Quit wasting your time with him. <br/>
<br/>
