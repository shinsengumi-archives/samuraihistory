<br/>
Samurai films are on a hot streak at the movies, on TV and on DVD. <br/>
<br/>
A DVD invasion arrives this week in the Rebel Samurai Sixties <br/>
Swordplay Classics box set (Criterion, $100, or $30 sold <br/>
separately), which includes Samurai Spy (1965), Sword of the Beast <br/>
(1965), Samurai Rebellion (1967) and Kill! (1968).<br/>
<br/>
Some new prints of the samurai films that were struck to produce the <br/>
DVDs have been shown at film festivals in New York and Washington, <br/>
D.C., and are scheduled for Cambridge, Mass., (Nov. 4-10) and San <br/>
Francisco (Dec. 2-22).<br/>
<br/>
Several also are being broadcast on the Independent Film Channel as <br/>
part of its Samurai Saturdays series (Kill! airs Saturday at 8 a.m. <br/>
ET/5 a.m. PT). In March, IFC will air the Japanese-produced Samurai <br/>
7 series, a sci-fi animé takeoff on Akira Kurosawa's Seven Samurai.<br/>
<br/>
A subset of the martial arts genre, samurai films have been made <br/>
since the early 1930s in Japan. They gained international status <br/>
when renowned directors such as Kurosawa (Rashomon) explored the <br/>
genre.<br/>
<br/>
Interest in Japanese pop culture and easy access to the films on DVD <br/>
is driving the resurgence. <br/>
<br/>
"It seems they're just now, at the dawn of the 21st century, finally <br/>
receiving the mainstream appreciation in the U.S. that is their <br/>
due," says Patrick Galloway, author of Stray Dogs & Lone Wolves: The <br/>
Samurai Film Handbook.<br/>
<br/>
"The popularity has always been there, and when (samurai films) have <br/>
properly been revived, they have always done well," says Michael <br/>
Jeck, an expert on Japanese films who coordinated the American Film <br/>
Institute's samurai cinema series, now in Silver Spring, Md. <br/>
<br/>
Seven Samurai remains a top-requested DVD in Criterion's 300-plus <br/>
library and sells steadily on Amazon.com. "I have to think that <br/>
(Quentin Tarantino's) Kill Bill films spotlighted the genre for many <br/>
of the uninitiated," says Amazon.com's DVD editor Doug Thomas. <br/>
<br/>
Swordplay is only part of the attraction of samurai films. "What you <br/>
have in a samurai battle is close-in, bladed warfare, the good guy <br/>
going against the bad guy face to face," Jeck says. "You have <br/>
kinetic energy, balletic grace and brutal force, all conjoined."<br/>
<br/>
A foreign cousin of the American Western, samurai films "have struck <br/>
a chord with U.S. audiences," IFC's George Lentz says. <br/>
<br/>
Director John Sturges adapted Seven Samurai to make The Magnificent <br/>
Seven; Sergio Leone adopted Kurosawa's Yojimbo to create Clint <br/>
Eastwood's "The Man with No Name" in three films; and George Lucas <br/>
says The Hidden Fortress (1958) inspired Star Wars. <br/>
<br/>
More recently, Tarantino has cited the movies starring the blind <br/>
swordsman Zatoichi as an influence for his Kill Bill films. And Tom <br/>
Cruise took up his sword in 2003's The Last Samurai.<br/>
<br/>
These films owe a debt to the counterculture anti-heroes in <br/>
Criterion's Rebel Samurai box set. "They are asking themselves 'Is <br/>
there a time when how I'm supposed to act conflicts with what I know <br/>
is right?' It's not just a guy with a sword," says co-producer Marc <br/>
Walkow. "Life and death are at stake."<br/>
<br/>
A new class of filmmakers is carrying on the tradition:<br/>
<br/>
Shinobi, a special-effects-infused samurai/ninja flick by director <br/>
Ten Shimoyama, is playing well in Japanese theaters.<br/>
<br/>
 Yoji Yamada, nominated by the Japanese Film Academy as best <br/>
director for The Hidden Blade (2004, due on DVD in January), begins <br/>
work on a new film, One-Line Samurai, early next year.<br/>
<br/>
When the Last Sword Is Drawn, the winner of last year's Japanese <br/>
Academy Award for best picture, arrives on DVD Dec. 27.<br/>
<br/>
These directors "are revitalizing samurai cinema by making lyrical <br/>
films divorced from mythology, presenting the samurai as <br/>
realistically as possible," Galloway says. "We're witnessing a new <br/>
chapter in the genre."</div>
