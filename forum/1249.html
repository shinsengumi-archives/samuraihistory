<h3>Question...</h3>
by <i>holydemon13</i>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-960013336">Hey!<br/>
       Those of you who live in, have been to, or have a great deal more <br/>
knowledge than I do of Japan (which is probably most of you): I was reading <br/>
something on Nobunaga, Asai and the likes from Shizugatake at the sho-shin site, and <br/>
I saw a picture of the spot where Asai (supposedly) took his seppuku.  The <br/>
caption reads "Scene of Nagamasa's seppuku, directly outside Odani's Apartment." <br/>
 Two questions: is it the site of Asai's seppuku and what exactly IS "Odani's <br/>
Apartment"?  The picture is here...<br/>
<br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.sho-shin.com/oda1.htm">http://www.sho-shin.com/oda1.htm</a><br/>
<br/>
       It requires some scrolling to get to, though.  Thanx in advance for <br/>
any info.  8-D<br/>

<br/>
Though I will say that the whole Japanese housing<br/>
system is a pain in the ass. I'm coming out $590 short<br/>
on the conversions from what the government pays me<br/>
for key money, deposit, agent fee, and first month's<br/>
rent and what my bank then reconverts it to in yen to<br/>
send to the Japanse bank. The difference between 106<br/>
yen per dollar and 104 yen, over $30,000, adds up to a<br/>
lot. <br/>
<br/>
That being said, I'm still living in Tokyo! It's not<br/>
Nagoya, but it will do!<br/>
<br/>
And did I mention my office is in Nish Azabu, about 5<br/>
min from Roppongi??<br/>

I am taking it easy--no harm no foul. Don't read in<br/>
meanness or sarcasm where there isn't any, okay?<br/>
Basically, whoever translated that was most likely<br/>
Japanese, was looking for the right word, and whatever<br/>
they wanted to translate (I doubt it was "apaato", but<br/>
maybe it was whatever the word "quarters" would<br/>
be--that I'm not so sure of...) didn't quite match up<br/>
with what WE would understand in English. Personally,<br/>
it made me laugh--I'm not tense about nothing, except<br/>
getting my key money paid to my landlord so I don't<br/>
lose my house...in Tokyo, just in case Tony is paying<br/>
attention...<br/>

The term "apartment" is exactly correct. Any suite of rooms in a palace set <br/>

Okay, for those of us not in academia, an apartment is<br/>

I've heard it used in that context before, but it's<br/>
HARDLY common. <br/>
