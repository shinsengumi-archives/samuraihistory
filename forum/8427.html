<h3>Insult from tea</h3>
by <i>capt_bochan</i>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1352105296">I am told that during the tea ceremony turning the chawan clockwise <br/>
when returning it to the host was an indication of hostilities to come. <br/>
Since samurai held the ceremony under such high regard they would never <br/>
outwardly show anything but respect to thier host and instead used this <br/>
simple gesture to display thier true feelings.<br/>
<br/>
I was wondering if anyone else has heard of this and can purhaps shed <br/>
light on it's origin.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Sounds like someone trying to read too much into<br/>
things, or something an author made up (Clavell, for<br/>
instance) to further his image of the "inscrutable"<br/>
Japanese. In my Sado experience, when you receive the<br/>
tea bowl, you turn in clockwise to get to the drinking<br/>
side (each bowl has a "face", which the host presents<br/>
to you, and you drink from the side opposite the face,<br/>
so you have to turn it). Once done, you turn it back<br/>
counterclockwise. Some schools make a big deal of<br/>
turning it 3 times (not completely around, but using 3<br/>
motions to turn it halfway around), some don't--it<br/>
just depends. B ut no, I've never ever ehard of the<br/>
direction indicating your hostile intentions--sounds<br/>
like complete bunk to me. <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1607288609">Matcha tea is the highest grade used for the tea ceremony. During <br/>
harvesting only the small stems called tencha are used. Everyday <br/>
table tea is called bancha. The lowest grade generally harvested <br/>
from the second or third cutting season. The first cutting in April <br/>
is the best and brings the majority of the farmer's annual income. A <br/>
step up from Bancha is Sencha harvested from the top two leaves of <br/>
the tea bush. Here in Shizuoka Japan we grow gyokuro tea which is <br/>
another fine grade of tea. Also using only the first cutting the <br/>
leaves are shaded two to three weeks before harvesting. This process <br/>
locks in the flavor. Inbetween these types are many mixes to produce <br/>
unique flavors. If you are interested I could explain each in <br/>
detail. <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1643246970">Hi.<br/>
<br/>
I just noticed the tea discussion. It sounds like your farmer was <br/>
pulling your leg. The whole story sounds pretty much wrong. The way to <br/>
really get on someone's nerves is to be excessively polite, not turning <br/>
a tea bowl backwards. The really big problem with turning a tea bowl <br/>
backwards is it makes yourself look bad. Not an all an acceptable <br/>
approach for displaying pique. Incidentally, tea bowls are descended <br/>
from Chinese herbal medicine bowls as are several other tea implements. <br/>
In theory, and occasionally in practice, every bowl has a spout for <br/>
administering medicine. Since you are not ill, you turn the bowl so <br/>
that spout points away from you. Also, Urasenke is one of the tea <br/>
schools which is into threes.</div>

 </span></blockquote>Tea is an extremely messy subject. There are several different plants <br/>
used to make one sort of tea or another. There are several different <br/>
tea ceremonies before you even start talking about tea schools. The <br/>
earliest type of tea introduced to Japan was called dancha and is <br/>
practically undrinkable. Or at least, it never became particularly <br/>
popular. I suggest that you read one of the introductory tea books. For <br/>
example, there is one in English by Sen Shoshitsu. I believe that <br/>
Herbert Plutschow has also written a book about tea.<br/>
