<div id="ygrps-yiv-612812024">Daimyo of the Tohoku region, made his capital in<br/>
Sendai. Had one eye, was nominally allied to Tokugawa<br/>
Ieyasu, though he was primarily out for himself. A<br/>
very able daimyo. That's all off the top of my head,<br/>
if you check Turnbull's Samurai Sourcebook, it<br/>
probably has a blurb on him, or the website associated<br/>
with this discussion board. <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1316213218">Masamune was a daimyo in northern Japan and was a friend and ally of<br/>
Tokugawa Ieyasu.   When the dust settled after the final Tokugawa triumph<br/>
he ended up with substantial holdings around Sendai.   He is a very colorful<br/>
figure partly because of he wore eye-patch and truly flamboyant helmets. <br/>
  He<br/>
sponsored a mission to Europe to visit the Pope and showed some partiality<br/>
towards Christianity and Christians until it was clear which way the <br/>
political<br/>
winds were blowing.<br/>
<br/>
NHK, the Japanese national broadcasting company, devoted a long mini-series<br/>
to his life, called Masamune, the One-Eyed Dragon (Dokuganryu, I think), and<br/>
released this mini-series on VHS and DVD some time ago.   I've seen it <br/>
listed<br/>
for sale on various Asian media web-sites.  <br/>
