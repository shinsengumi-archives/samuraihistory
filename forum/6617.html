<div id="ygrps-yiv-1287030551">Hello, I'm new here. Nice to meet you all. =)<br/>
<br/>
I have a question. I'm wondering if wasn't permitted for a foreigner <br/>
(like a Westerner, or a someone else from another part of Asian)to <br/>
become a Samurai? I have nothing against bias issues, but I heard a <br/>
rumor that you have to be pure bred Japanese to become a Samurai, <br/>
dispite what is portray in Hollywood movies.<br/>
<br/>
Thank you.</div>

 </span></blockquote>Well, if you're talking about now, then it doesn't<br/>
matter if you're Japanese, European, or Martian--the<br/>
samurai class was legislated out of existence in the<br/>
late 1800's, so no, not even Japanese can be samurai<br/>
anymore. The samurai class doesn't exist.<br/>
<br/>
If you mean back then, then that's a debatable issue.<br/>
Many will allege that William Adams, an English ship<br/>
pilot, became samurai when he was awarded the title of<br/>
hatamoto by Tokugawa Ieyasu. Since technically only<br/>
samurai could hold the title, it stands to reason that<br/>
he was therefore also made samurai. So there's one<br/>
instance. Not many others exist, if at all. <br/>

 </span></blockquote>No need to apologize--you do better than many native<br/>
English speakers who make no attempt to communicate<br/>
like adults. <br/>
<br/>
I should have mentioned in my previous answer that<br/>
there was no list of "Requirements to be a Samurai"<br/>
that specified Japanese ethinicity. Post-1590's, The<br/>
only requirement to be a samurai was to be born a<br/>
member of the samurai class. Very rarely, if ever, was<br/>
someone granted "samurai status" as a reward for<br/>
service, etc, in the Edo period. Will Adams is an<br/>
extremely rare case, even if you ignore the fact that<br/>
he wasn't Japanese. <br/>
<br/>
Prior to the Edo period, the line between Samurai and<br/>
other classes was much less clear. Samurai could farm,<br/>
and peasants could go to war, and some individuals did<br/>
both and could have been considered both samurai and<br/>
well-to-do peasant. <br/>

The only other case I know of concerns one of Adam's shipmates-he was <br/>
also granted the same status as Will, and in fact was given a larger <br/>
estate by Ieyasu. I don't recall his name and since most of my <br/>
English language books are at home can't check on it.<br/>
There is much debate on whether either of these gents were actually <br/>
of samurai status-one of the best treatments on the subject is one of <br/>
the essays in "Learning from Shogun:Japanese History And Western <br/>
Fantasy" by the University Of California's Department Of Asian <br/>
Studies (1980).<br/>
But "Samurai Will" was as close as any non-Japanese got to being one!</div>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1687405350">One of my Japanese sources shows the second European advisor's name <br/>
to be the Dutchman Jan Joosten Van Lodensteijn-the present day Yaesu-<br/>
cho in Tokyo in named in honor of its Dutch resident.<br/>
It also states that there is no documented evidence of either <br/>
Lodensteijn or Adams having ever been granted hatamoto stauts-rather, <br/>
like other non-military advisors to a daimyo (doctors, priests, etc), <br/>
they were classified as hogaimono. Doctors were extended the <br/>
privelege of wearing the two swords so I assume Adams was as well.</div>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-944466914">Excuse me, but I have to praise your work, Randy. I'm totally <br/>
impressed with your research and activities. It's people like you <br/>
that give historical studies a good name. You're truly diverse, <br/>
adverse, intellegent, and articulate. I'm utterly impressed. If I <br/>
were Japanese, I'd be proud of what you are doing. I'm learning so <br/>
much so far. I can understand why it's a rule here to be serious and <br/>
mature. You the samurai really seriously. Forgive me for not showing <br/>
enough respect to you.</div>
