<div id="ygrps-yiv-111127107">Hi Tony.<br/>
       Just a question on your pre-Sekigahara comment.  Do you think it would <br/>
be possible to do, and is there enough information out there to make <br/>
credible, an ALTERNATE-HISTORY romance from the Sengoku period involving Oda's sister <br/>
that was married to Shibata and Asai?  Thanks for the info on Toyotomi, Oda <br/>
and Tokugawa, too!!!!!!  8-D  Take care.<br/>

I don't see why not. Given the theory of the "butterfly effect" you can take off <br/>
history at almost any given point and see where you can go. That one certainly <br/>
would work.<br/>
<br/>
I used to toy with writing an alternate history wherein Perry's flagship sank on <br/>
the way to Japan, and it was a few decades before a formal opening. By then, the <br/>
shogunate was in a different place (structurally) and not as weak, thus it never <br/>
fell; and since Japan opened to the west later, it developed armies and navies <br/>
later and thus never fought the Russo Japanese war (thus Nikolas II's position <br/>
wasn't as weakened, and the Bolshevik revolution failed) and...<br/>

 </span></blockquote>It's part of chaos theory (and also, conveniently, the title of a new film).<br/>
<br/>
The idea is that the flapping of a butterfly's wings on one side of the globe <br/>
might be the triggering breeze that creates a hurricane on the other side.<br/>
<br/>
The guts of it are that the smallest of things can have incredible outcomes.<br/>
