<h3>The Last Samurai</h3>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-682775140">From the people who have already seen "the last samurai" - any <br/>
opinions?<br/>
<br/>
I give it a 6 or 7 out of 10 -- I thought it was pretty well done, <br/>
and the 'historical accuracy' didn't really bother me one way or the <br/>
other because my knowledge of 1870's Japan is almost nil, but also <br/>
because it seemed more like a fantasy with Japanese samurai in a <br/>
country similar to Japan rather than a movie that is supposed to be <br/>
based in Japan and historically accurate.  Probably because to me it <br/>
didn't really 'look' like Japan - the mountains and scenery didn't <br/>
look right (probably because it was filmed in New Zealand) and the <br/>
plot treated the 'samurai' almost like a backwards indian tribe <br/>
rather than any sort of politically or socially viable group - <br/>
taking the 'dances with wolves' bit a little too far.<br/>
<br/>
It was good pop fiction, but I dread to think how many people will <br/>
take it as pure history...</div>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1278827097">I found it extremely entertaining, in my opinion it is a very good<br/>
movie. It is loosely based on historic events and you have to remember<br/>
that it is only a movie, fiction. Some people will say it is crap since<br/>
it is not 100% historically accurate. I don't agree with that point of<br/>
view. It should be judged as a movie and a movie only.<br/>

<h3>Re: [samuraihistory] The Last Samurai</h3>

<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1216821299">Historically it was as accurate as... Gladiator: not much. The setting <br/>
is historically sound, the events are pure Hollywood fiction, but why <br/>
not? People loved it!! I think all over it was a good movie, even with <br/>
all its inconsistencies. I especially enjoyed the part when Algren is <br/>
"prisoner' in the Japanese village, and "learns" to be Japanese. The <br/>
first battle (in the forest) was EXCELLENT as well. The scene with the <br/>
samurai coming out of the mist... Kurosawa himself would have loved <br/>
that.<br/>
<br/>
*** SPOILER DOWN HERE ***<br/>
<br/>
The lamest part was at the end, when the Emperor refused to sign a deal <br/>
with the Americans just because of Algren bringing back Katsumoto's <br/>
sword. That was a bit like... mmmmhhhh... I was happy thou that Algren <br/>
went back to his girlfriend (Ok, ok, I know I'm cheesy...)<br/>
<br/>
Anyway, good movie, and I'll buy the DVD as soon as it comes out.<br/>

  Cutting through a rifle is not an unknown event. As for the movie, if the blade impacted just behind the action of the rifle, I would say that it's almost easy. Maybe we can see that on the DVD.

<h3>Re: The Last Samurai</h3>

<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-2093852098">I thought the movie was very entertaining. I throughly enjoyed it. <br/>
The movie is loosely based on the samurai revolt during the Meiji <br/>
Restoration. During the 1860's three samurai lead efforts to restore <br/>
imperial rule. However, one of the samurai wanted to modernize the <br/>
country while the other two did not. The two samurai lead <br/>
approximately 10,000 followers in revolt which lasted aproximately <br/>
seven months. The revolt wasn't so much against modernization but <br/>
aginast the loss of status, power, food and wealth of the samurai.<br/>

Cutting through a rifle is not an unknown event. As for the movie, if the blade impacted just behind the action of the rifle, I would say that it's almost easy. Maybe we can see that on the DVD. The sword that Algren carried was freshly forged and probably had the sharpest and strongest blade on the field of battle that day. <br/>

<h3>Re: [samuraihistory] The Last Samurai</h3>
by <i>OlasNah</i>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-318657550">The real battle of Shinoyama (That the final battle in this movie is loosely based on) didn't end much different than the one in the film. The samurai were gunned down nearly to the last man, and Saigo (Katsumoto) died early in the battle after being injured in the groin by a bullet and his aide assited him with committing hara-kiri, and then charged off into the battle only to be killed himself later on. <br/>
 <br/>
The battle in the forest was almost 'scary' to me. The sight of the armoured Samurai was awe inspiring. I would have run myself if I were one of those conscript soldiers. <br/>
 <br/>
Algren's integration with the Japanese was interesting. Here is a guy who apparently cannot be killed in battle (this kind of thing has been written about before) who wants terribly to die and be rid of his guilt over killing innocents. He finds comfort in the religious lifestyle of the samurai and finds that he can redeem himself by fighting for them. The end was perfect to me. The battle could have been better (I agree with others that it was too similar to Braveheart's battle of Falkirk, although it did not detract from the film at all). Algren's appearance before Emperor Meiji (nice touch with him struggling to walk from all his injuries) and begging the Emperor to hear Katsumoto's voice in the form of the rebellion and slow down the modernization of Japan was great. (Look at what it got them into later on)<br/>

Historically it was as accurate as... Gladiator: not much. The setting <br/>
is historically sound, the events are pure Hollywood fiction, but why <br/>
not? People loved it!! I think all over it was a good movie, even with <br/>
all its inconsistencies. I especially enjoyed the part when Algren is <br/>
"prisoner' in the Japanese village, and "learns" to be Japanese. The <br/>
first battle (in the forest) was EXCELLENT as well. The scene with the <br/>
samurai coming out of the mist... Kurosawa himself would have loved <br/>
that.<br/>
<br/>
*** SPOILER DOWN HERE ***<br/>
<br/>
The lamest part was at the end, when the Emperor refused to sign a deal <br/>
with the Americans just because of Algren bringing back Katsumoto's <br/>
sword. That was a bit like... mmmmhhhh... I was happy thou that Algren <br/>
went back to his girlfriend (Ok, ok, I know I'm cheesy...)<br/>
<br/>
Anyway, good movie, and I'll buy the DVD as soon as it comes out.<br/>

might include discussing movies.<br/>
I find interesting how you ask not to judge a movie, but you judge  <br/>
PEOPLE - people you don't know.<br/>
<br/>
Regarding the last part of your mail, first of all I do not have a back  <br/>

is, as I can't find it on any dictionary.<br/>

Exactly. The people expected it, and so it was done. But the blade would<br/>
have suffered too many damages or even bending after such an<br/>
unbelievable cut. Even in before WWII are reported some complete cuts of<br/>
gun barrels or heavy blades or even maces, in Axis propaganda (even<br/>
Italian) but I think it was fiction. I don't know which way the cutted<br/>
old gun barrel was made, but the only reference about a damage to a<br/>
machine gun barrel I once had, referred to a partial cut and little<br/>
bending of the barrel (Bren gun in Malaya campaign). No information<br/>
about the blade's damages.     <br/>

Cutting through a rifle is not an unknown event. As for the movie, if<br/>
the blade impacted just behind the action of the rifle, I would say that<br/>
it's almost easy. Maybe we can see that on the DVD. The sword that<br/>
Algren carried was freshly forged and probably had the sharpest and<br/>
strongest blade on the field of battle that day. <br/>

I do not think "The Last Samurai" is historically accurate, but I think<br/>
the <br/>
battle at the very end of the movie actually did take place, something<br/>
like the <br/>
gun powder rebellion. Well, anyway I also thought it was a good movie.<br/>
It was <br/>
quit touching. I went to go see it with my friends when it first came<br/>
out, <br/>
they try to act as if they are tough, but when we walked out of the<br/>
theater they <br/>
were balling their eyes out. We dont talk about that to this day though.<br/>
Yeah <br/>
it was a good movie.<br/>

In one of my books, there is an old drawing of a katana slicing through a steel helmet. This is a different situation, but not terribly so. I have also seen video demonstrations of custom made Katanas being used to break clean through rapiers/broadswords of top quality European manufacture. It's not above such a sword's capability to do something like that given enough force, like you said. (The rifles these guys were carrying could also have been cheaply made)<br/>
<br/>
I think that from the film's perspective, and for that of the public viewing it, this was almost a necessary scene. The Samurai sword has always had a reputation for hardness and cutting power, but most of the Western world doesn't know about it, no matter how many episodes of 'Highlander' they might have watched. It was a nice example of one of Japan's main contributions to military technology. <br/>

I still dont think it could happen, it looked to me as if it sliced thru the action.. true, it probably was the best on the field that day (well except for after about the first 15 minutes that Tom had been fighting), but how hard Tom could swing that sword, momentum and downward force and strength have a lot to do w/ that as well..<br/>

I do not think "The Last Samurai" is historically accurate, but I think the <br/>
battle at the very end of the movie actually did take place, something like the <br/>
gun powder rebellion. Well, anyway I also thought it was a good movie. It was <br/>
quit touching. I went to go see it with my friends when it first came out, <br/>
they try to act as if they are tough, but when we walked out of the theater they <br/>
were balling their eyes out. We dont talk about that to this day though. Yeah <br/>
it was a good movie.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1870962954">At the begining of the movie they were shooting what looked like springfield precussion rifles, during the battle, they looked to be bolt actions.. I asked about shooting rifles to make sure I wasnt the only one, and to get someone elses opinion who had a little bit of experience.. but it is jsut a movie.. so whadda I care??<br/>

What does shooting a rifle have to do with getting it broken in half by a sword? Most rifles I fired were all metal. The military doesn't issue muskets anymore. <br/>

In one of my books, there is an old drawing of a katana slicing through a steel helmet. This is a different situation, but not terribly so. I have also seen video demonstrations of custom made Katanas being used to break clean through rapiers/broadswords of top quality European manufacture. It's not above such a sword's capability to do something like that given enough force, like you said. (The rifles these guys were carrying could also have been cheaply made)<br/>
<br/>
I think that from the film's perspective, and for that of the public viewing it, this was almost a necessary scene. The Samurai sword has always had a reputation for hardness and cutting power, but most of the Western world doesn't know about it, no matter how many episodes of 'Highlander' they might have watched. It was a nice example of one of Japan's main contributions to military technology. <br/>

I still dont think it could happen, it looked to me as if it sliced thru the action.. true, it probably was the best on the field that day (well except for after about the first 15 minutes that Tom had been fighting), but how hard Tom could swing that sword, momentum and downward force and strength have a lot to do w/ that as well..<br/>

Cutting through a rifle is not an unknown event. As for the movie, if the blade impacted just behind the action of the rifle, I would say that it's almost easy. Maybe we can see that on the DVD. The sword that Algren carried was freshly forged and probably had the sharpest and strongest blade on the field of battle that day. <br/>

higher ranking members, like saigo takamori, may have been mounted), <br/>
and they fought with rifles. there was a final suicide charge, but <br/>
only after months of rather successful resistance.<br/>

<br/>
Well, coming from Hollywood poor minds... <br/>
<br/>
I am just very happy that <br/>
the japanese civilization folks was not portrayed as <br/>
monkeylish almost-human with asiatic charicatural eyes and yellow toothes... <br/>
<br/>
as well as happened with the Gladiator that showed a positive although <br/>
historically innacurate image of Rome before christianism <br/>
<br/>
and in the XIII Warrior, an more accurate expression of the vikings instead <br/>
of their usual B...S... of weird mental insane dirty bearded barbarian <br/>
people. <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Seems at least that the ignorantic extremism in Hollywood is dimminishing <br/>
gradually... They just need to research more on history even to make their <br/>
fiction movies. <br/>
<br/>
Want something really worse? <br/>
There is some babbling about another movie with a bride holding an bad <br/>
replica of an japanese katana.. Unfortunatelly I didn�t remember the <br/>
title... <br/>
<br/>
Be well <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-799519080">I thought the movie was absolutly wonderful.  The story was great, the <br/>
acting was great, the music was great (Hans Zimmer you know), the scenery <br/>
was breathtaking, the attention to detail was great (i.e. costumes), the <br/>
fight scenes were great.  And Shin Koyamada was both talented and HOT.  I <br/>
saw it twice.  The only thing was I made the mistake of sitting by my friend <br/>
the second time and he made me realize that the part with the gattling gun <br/>
was unrealistic.  Still, all things considered I give it and 8 out of 5.  <br/>
One of the all time greatest movies.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-916365037">They didn't say it except for just before that final charge, but Algren's character had a curse of not being able to be killed in battle. He said it himself that he should have died so many times before. He obviously was shot up pretty good. He could barely walk or bow while in the Emperor's prescence. Imagine how hard it must have been for him to climb those steps to the palace with those injuries. . <br/>

<br/>
I think there is a missunderstanding here. <br/>
I DID NOT called asiatics as monkeys. <br/>
I said that Hollywood old movied did. <br/>
<br/>
And for your information, I have also japanese ancestry as well, and never <br/>
called my ancestors as "monkeys"!!! <br/>
<br/>
Besides, where is the moderation? <br/>
Such an insult is allowed  in this list? <br/>
If such incivilized act like him is fully allowed, I think I am outplaced <br/>
and the moderation is very well allowed to unsubscribe me. <br/>
<br/>
And yes, although I do not advocate any nationalistic feelings, there is <br/>
some things Brazil have to be proud, but have NOTHING to do with samurai <br/>
history topics. <br/>
<br/>
Again, if  ye read carefully my previous message, ye would see that I din�t <br/>
said the asiatics are monkeys or something like that, but I said that I AM <br/>
VERY HAPPY that at least in this movie, Hollywood DID NOT portrayed them <br/>
like that!!! <br/>
<br/>
Do they have read/write english discipline at yer school? <br/>
<br/>
If ye have a minnimun of education, I think ye should apologize. <br/>
