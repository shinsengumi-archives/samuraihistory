<br/>
Heh, I don't think that most people dislike him. It's just the few elitists<br/>
getting their say. On one hand, I can't blame them, because they're<br/>
constantly having to deal with misconceptions about samurai and feudal Japan<br/>
that pop culture has taught people, especially *outside* of Japan. I don't<br/>
know all that much about Musashi, but I do know that my boyfriend is greatly<br/>
inspired by The Book of Five Rings, and I find there's nothing wrong with<br/>
that. That book has inspired many people and I think it's healthy, to be<br/>
honest.<br/>
<br/>
I do, however, get annoyed when people make assumptions about history or<br/>
historical figures without doing their own research by looking at more<br/>
reliable sources. I can't believe how many people have come by here asking<br/>
whether Himura Kenshin really existed and whether the events of the anime<br/>
are real. Geez. >_> A lot of the "common" information about Musashi  is most<br/>
likely legends embellished by time (and perhaps by himself and/or his own<br/>
admirers), too. I'm no expert on Japanese history, but I'm assuming the<br/>
annoyance is coming from people interpreting legends as fact. Nonetheless,<br/>
Miyamoto Musashi's Book of Five Rings has inspired a wide range of people,<br/>
and I think that's a wonderful thing. The words themselves, I think, are<br/>
timeless and don't necessarily have to relate to a particular period of<br/>
history.<br/>
<br/>
I must say, though, that the reaction of certain individuals on this list to<br/>
newbies asking uninformed questions is quite childish and unbecoming to my<br/>
eyes. Perhaps the admin(s) of this list should consider splitting Samurai<br/>
History up into two lists, one more pop culture oriented and another more<br/>
history oriented. That way, the elitist historian types are less likely to<br/>
be faced with questions that make them roll their eyes and act so rudely.<br/>
After all, it seems they've pretty much given up on trying to educate people<br/>
by correcting their mistakes... so why not just seperate the historians from<br/>
the casual fans?<br/>

I don't care about Musashi one way or the other, but I do think he's vastly <br/>

 </span></blockquote>I believe the idea has been considered. Problem is,<br/>
some people don't know the difference between history<br/>
and pop-culture. <br/>
<br/>
I think most of us don't particularly care if someone<br/>
has a legitimate question. It's that too many times<br/>
we've seen a legitimate answer get the response "but<br/>
that's not true--my sensei told me so" or "but I saw<br/>
it on Rurouni Kenshin" or something. Nothing against<br/>
those who practice martial arts or watch anime, but<br/>
come on, people, if you don't like the answers you<br/>
get, do a little research yourself. Books aren't that<br/>
scary, trust me. (Well, okay, maybe Totman's "The<br/>
Collapse of the Tokugawa Bakufu"...I'll admit I<br/>
couldn't take it anymore after renewing it 3 times at<br/>
the library...I had to stop...I'll go slit my stomach<br/>
now). <br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>The give-up is because too many of those people either<br/>
a. don't want correction, only validation or b. don't<br/>
realize that the people they are talking to really<br/>
KNOW what they are talking about. I'm not saying I'm<br/>
an expert, by any means--I'm always open to<br/>
correction. But when you've got Tony, Evalerio, Will<br/>
Letham, Kitsuno, Carlo/Tsubame, who are all experts in<br/>
some area, and someone still persists in telling them<br/>
they don't know what they are talking about, because<br/>
they read it online somewhere else, it's very<br/>
frustrating.<br/>
<br/>
I applaud your optimism and your response...I really<br/>
do agree with it. But it'd be easier if we weren't<br/>
besieged almost daily with someone who either still<br/>
thinks the Japanese walk around with swords and that<br/>
ninjas exist, or someone who wants to be one, or<br/>
thinks that anime is a legitimate historical source,<br/>
or...one of a hundred different things. <br/>

In a technical sense, (here's where I make people angry) there aren't <br/>
any schools that teach "true" Niten Ichi Ryu.  This was the martial <br/>
art that Musashi "invented" but it died with him.  On all the <br/>
historical counts that I've read, none of his students could master <br/>
the style.  That's where it ended.  What is practiced today is based <br/>
on specualtion of what Niten Ichi Ryu might have been.  Since none of <br/>
the techniques of the original art weren't learned by Musashi's <br/>
disciples, "Modern Niten Ichi Ryu" is not even derivitive in nature.  <br/>
It is a new martial art in itself that pays homage to a man who <br/>
mastered fighting with 2 swords.<br/>
