<br/>
Also  worth reading, "Hagakure: The Book of the Samurai." By Yamamoto<br/>
Tsunetomo.<br/>
----------------------<br/>
Aha, I get to go into my full-fledged rant against "Hagekure." Don't get me<br/>
wrong, there are a few worthwhile things in the book. But as a Manual of<br/>
Bushido (whatever that is) it falls far short. I'm not sure how this book<br/>
got into the general public -- as far as I know, Yamamoto intended this to<br/>
be a private correspondance with members of his clan.<br/>
<br/>
That being said: Yamamoto never fought in any battles in his life. He knew<br/>
nothing at all about what it was like to actually face the concept of death;<br/>
he had never experienced this, never fought in a battle, never faced<br/>
grinding poverty or hunger. It was relatively easy for him to rant and rave<br/>
about how samurai "act like women" (what did he know about being a woman?<br/>
Nothing at all  >:  ) from the comfort of his peaceful quarters. <br/>
<br/>
Why did he excortiate the 47 Ako Ronin who avenged their lord? He claimed<br/>
that the Ako ronin should have commited mass seppuku rather than wait and<br/>
plan to actually avenge their lord. It's quite easy to advocate mass seppuku<br/>
when it is someone else -- never yourself -- facing such a situation. When<br/>
you have never have faced watching your lord be sentenced to seppuku, never<br/>
faced the prospects of being forced to leave your castle and fief behind to<br/>
be "tossed by the waves" (the literal meaning of "ronin").<br/>
<br/>
The world has been filled with various politicians and philosophers who talk<br/>
about facing death and being brave in battle -- when they have never faced<br/>
the situation themselves. HAGAKURE is one of the most over-rated,<br/>
over-wrought works of alleged philosophy that exists. I'd much rather read<br/>
the accounts of common soldiers or activists who actually know about what it<br/>
is truly like to face death.<br/>
<br/>
Just my two mon here about this. <br/>
