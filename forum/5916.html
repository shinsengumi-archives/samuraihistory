would essentially be impossible to pronounce in the<br/>
Japanese language, I sincerely doubt it. <br/>

 </span></blockquote>I see. So you are asking if a fictional fantasy<br/>
character is a samurai, then, right? Being as he uses<br/>
what I assume to be a samurai sword based on the name,<br/>
then he could very well be a character based loosely<br/>
on samurai, yes. However, he's a fictional fantasy<br/>
character--it would seem to me that it's irrelevant. <br/>

Oh, from what I've seen, Sephiroth is indeed a samurai, if you see Masamune is a Katana as well, not light the sword wielded by Cloud. So, in my opinion, Sephiroth is the real samurai, even he is a fictional.<br/>

hi, well i think that Sephiroth is a samurai to those<br/>
who love him & call him "One Winged Angel " but there<br/>
are people think that he isnt a samurai because he's<br/>
evil, so it depends on the person are asking, if you<br/>
remove he's evil side he will be a true samurai, to<br/>
me, he's a samurai no need to argue about it, there<br/>
are evil samurais around the world, aren't there ???<br/>
 <br/>
Hopes This Helps.<br/>

Hey sorry to say but no sephiroth is not a samurai yet<br/>
acts like one in more than one way.  So I guess you<br/>
could say he is a samurai but not a samurai at the<br/>
same time......  if that helps at all. lol<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Yes, he's perfectly free to say that. There was<br/>
nothing derogatory or insulting. And he's got a<br/>
point--this isn't a video game message board. I'm<br/>
surprised no one has stormed on to give the definition<br/>
of samurai yet: the warrior social class of Japan from<br/>
the 11th through 19th centuries. The entire question<br/>
is ill-suited for this board. If the creator of the<br/>
game/anime/whatever says he's a "samurai", then in the<br/>
context of the game/anime/whatever, he is. However,<br/>
notions of evil or good, what sword he carries, etc.,<br/>
have no bearing whatsoever on anything. In the real<br/>
world, there were "good" samurai and "evil" samurai.<br/>
Not everyone who carried a sword was a samurai. Point<br/>
of fact, for most of the history of the samurai the<br/>
sword wasn't his most important weapon--the bow and<br/>
then the spear were. The sword only became supremely<br/>
prominent post 1600 when the majority of wars ceased. <br/>
<br/>
As to "interfering with grown ups' talk", are you<br/>
serious? The "samurainess" of an anime character would<br/>
seem to me to be a rather childish subject, to be<br/>
dismissed by most adults. That's why I think very<br/>
little response has been generated to the question.<br/>
Again, try an anime/video game list. <br/>
<br/>
Thanks again,<br/>

Mods don't 'interfere', they merely enforce the rules of the forum.<br/>
 <br/>
If you go badly off the agreed content, then the mods are well within their rights to either ask you to get back on track or to delete the thread.<br/>

hi, well i think that Sephiroth is a samurai to those<br/>
who love him & call him "One Winged Angel " but there<br/>
are people think that he isnt a samurai because he's<br/>
evil, so it depends on the person are asking, if you<br/>
remove he's evil side he will be a true samurai, to<br/>
me, he's a samurai no need to argue about it, there<br/>
are evil samurais around the world, aren't there ???<br/>

 </span></blockquote>I know exactly what you're discussing--I've had to<br/>
approve or disapprove every single message regarding<br/>
this subject. And the discussion is okay, depending on<br/>
how you go with it--if you wanted to list<br/>
characteristics of a fictional character and ask if<br/>
they were consistent with him being a samurai in the<br/>
historical sense of the word, then that's fine. As I<br/>
said, having a samurai sword does not a samurai make.<br/>
And the answers I've seen to the question are leading<br/>
it quickly into the realm of gaming and anime, and out<br/>
of any historical context or value. The fact that the<br/>
original question failed to explain what the heck a<br/>
"sephiroth" is was a clue to me that it came from a<br/>
gamer, but I let it go because it could have led to<br/>
some interesting discussion, if done right, and I<br/>
didn't have a reason NOT to let it go. <br/>
<br/>
Please bring it back to the historical side, or we'll<br/>
end it. <br/>

 </span></blockquote>Yes, he's perfectly free to say that. There was<br/>
nothing derogatory or insulting. And he's got a<br/>
point--this isn't a video game message board. I'm<br/>
surprised no one has stormed on to give the definition<br/>
of samurai yet: the warrior social class of Japan from<br/>
the 11th through 19th centuries. The entire question<br/>
is ill-suited for this board. If the creator of the<br/>
game/anime/whatever says he's a "samurai", then in the<br/>
context of the game/anime/whatever, he is. However,<br/>
notions of evil or good, what sword he carries, etc.,<br/>
have no bearing whatsoever on anything. In the real<br/>
world, there were "good" samurai and "evil" samurai.<br/>
Not everyone who carried a sword was a samurai. Point<br/>
of fact, for most of the history of the samurai the<br/>
sword wasn't his most important weapon--the bow and<br/>
then the spear were. The sword only became supremely<br/>
prominent post 1600 when the majority of wars ceased. <br/>
<br/>
As to "interfering with grown ups' talk", are you<br/>
serious? The "samurainess" of an anime character would<br/>
seem to me to be a rather childish subject, to be<br/>
dismissed by most adults. That's why I think very<br/>
little response has been generated to the question.<br/>
Again, try an anime/video game list. <br/>
<br/>
Thanks again,<br/>
<br/>
The assistant management (bucking for promotion...)<br/>

 </span></blockquote>I know exactly what you're discussing--I've had to<br/>
approve or disapprove every single message regarding<br/>
this subject. And the discussion is okay, depending on<br/>
how you go with it--if you wanted to list<br/>
characteristics of a fictional character and ask if<br/>
they were consistent with him being a samurai in the<br/>
historical sense of the word, then that's fine. As I<br/>
said, having a samurai sword does not a samurai make.<br/>
And the answers I've seen to the question are leading<br/>
it quickly into the realm of gaming and anime, and out<br/>
of any historical context or value. The fact that the<br/>
original question failed to explain what the heck a<br/>
"sephiroth" is was a clue to me that it came from a<br/>
gamer, but I let it go because it could have led to<br/>
some interesting discussion, if done right, and I<br/>
didn't have a reason NOT to let it go. <br/>
<br/>
Please bring it back to the historical side, or we'll<br/>
end it. <br/>

 </span></blockquote>Believe it or not, this isn't the nicest of net<br/>
neighborhoods. I've been accused of being the<br/>
neighborhood bully once or twice. You've got to be<br/>
tough in this business--many people on this email list<br/>
are serious historians, published authors, people who<br/>
read Japanese history in the original Japanese--not<br/>
the anime Shibuya-speak, mind you, but good old<br/>
fashioned 12th century stuff. These people don't<br/>
consider gaming questions worthy of their bandwidth.<br/>
There have been heated issues when gaming types come<br/>
on here and think they know everything about samurai<br/>
simply because they beat the 17th level of "Samurai<br/>
Showdown" or "Tenchu" or they watched Rurouni Kenshin<br/>
("Samurai X") 25 times. If you want to learn about<br/>
samurai, start at the website www.samuraiarchives.com<br/>
and find the "Top 10 misconceptions of the samurai".<br/>
When people come here asking gaming or anime<br/>
questions, often the assumption is that they are<br/>
deluded by one or two or all 10 of those. Things can<br/>
get painful. <br/>
<br/>
Grow a thick skin, and be willing to learn, and this<br/>
is a nice place. If that bothers you, then I dare you<br/>
to say something like "Anthony Bryant couldn't tell a<br/>
sugake odoshi from a obon odori" and see what happens.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
*note to everyone on the board--why am I continuing to<br/>
fill your in box? Because if I answered his emails<br/>
singly instead of on the list, all the others who<br/>
answered/asked the question wouldn't get the benefit.<br/>
Sorry, and thanks for the patience.<br/>

loyalty to a lord?  Is it just the ability to use a bow and/or sword?  <br/>
Or is it the following of the code in all things in life?  Do any of <br/>
those who come from a samurai lineage deserve the title samurai?<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Tony, I think the problem is your use of the word<br/>
"deserve". While in the sense I think you mean it's<br/>
used as "applicable to", as in the word "samurai"<br/>
applies to a member of that particular social class<br/>
from that time period, some people are going to think<br/>
of deserve as meeting some set of behavior criteria.<br/>
This plays right into the hands of the "all samurai<br/>
are noble, live by bushido, blah blah" crowd, and<br/>
hence the confusion. <br/>
<br/>
In that sense, there's no "deserve" or "don't<br/>
deserve". You either simply "were" a samurai, or you<br/>
weren't, regardless of what you did, good or bad. <br/>
<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Good point. I meant it as "should be called" -- in essence, the only <br/>
people who deserve to have the title -- rightly or wrongly -- are those <br/>
entitled to it. No commentary on worthiness or so forth; it's strictly a <br/>
legalistic position.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Believe it or not, this isn't the nicest of net<br/>
neighborhoods. I've been accused of being the<br/>
neighborhood bully once or twice. You've got to be<br/>
tough in this business--many people on this email list<br/>
are serious historians, published authors, people who<br/>
read Japanese history in the original Japanese--not<br/>
the anime Shibuya-speak, mind you, but good old<br/>
fashioned 12th century stuff. These people don't<br/>
consider gaming questions worthy of their bandwidth.<br/>
There have been heated issues when gaming types come<br/>
on here and think they know everything about samurai<br/>
simply because they beat the 17th level of "Samurai<br/>
Showdown" or "Tenchu" or they watched Rurouni Kenshin<br/>
("Samurai X") 25 times. If you want to learn about<br/>
samurai, start at the website www.samuraiarchives.com<br/>
and find the "Top 10 misconceptions of the samurai".<br/>
When people come here asking gaming or anime<br/>
questions, often the assumption is that they are<br/>
deluded by one or two or all 10 of those. Things can<br/>
get painful. <br/>
<br/>
Grow a thick skin, and be willing to learn, and this<br/>
is a nice place. If that bothers you, then I dare you<br/>
to say something like "Anthony Bryant couldn't tell a<br/>
sugake odoshi from a obon odori" and see what happens.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
*note to everyone on the board--why am I continuing to<br/>
fill your in box? Because if I answered his emails<br/>
singly instead of on the list, all the others who<br/>
answered/asked the question wouldn't get the benefit.<br/>
Sorry, and thanks for the patience.<br/>

utensils, or other items, were often given names. Yes,<br/>
according to tradition Musashi's famous opponent<br/>
Sasaki Kojiro named his sword "drying pole", I believe<br/>
due to it's length. I'm not a Musashi afficionado, so<br/>
I can't provide anything further. <br/>

Of course you aren't a samurai. It's impossible to be<br/>
one, since the samurai class was abolished in the<br/>
1870's. Legally none exist anymore. But, on to the<br/>
rest of your post.<br/>

"Sabarashiï¿½h, eh? What meaning are you going for? I<br/>
can think of multiple kanji combinations, but can't<br/>
identify immediately which you might be using to give<br/>
meaning. <br/>
<br/>
As for a name for a short sword, I'm not a sword<br/>
expert, so I'll leave that to them. <br/>

Im very curious on whom your fencing coach is? As you know as a scholer of kendo, that modesty is a notable value in swordplay , calling your sword wonderfull (or a oily fish lol kitsuno hehe funniest thing all day)<br/>
is, if you dont mind me saying slightly vain. Im curious at which fencing school you attended, and under whom you studied i will happily give you all my kendo details in a fair trade hehe, although i did speak to a guy whom named his sword kageonimusha, shadow demon warrior i think please correct me if im wrong, bloody awful name.

defense were developed as general defensive techniques against all comers.<br/>
<br/>
I realize it is fairly easy to take pot-shots at those who seem --- less literate---  than ourselves. I also grow impatient with <br/>
people who wish to declare themselves, or seek, to be, samurai.  However,  it is possible to develop within ourselves the best of <br/>
the samurai traits. It is far easier to be critical, but a challenge to our character to be educators and compassionate.<br/>
<br/>
Lastly, I find myself curious as to Mr. Wilson's age and educational level,  whether he is dyslexic, and if English is a second or <br/>
third language.<br/>
<br/>
Just for the h-e-double-hockey-sticks of it..... how many of you 'play' in the Society for Creative Anachronism......  if you do, do <br/>
you pursue 'European' or 'Asian/Japanese personas? (No, lol, I don't mean as in 'chase' them...)<br/>

Many martial arts and traditions have the same values.<br/>
You can find that all over the world.<br/>

Not to be picky, but its "Aikido", not "Akaido".<br/>

 </span></blockquote>As simple as what? You haven't clarified what you are<br/>
talking about. What do you think we were picking on?<br/>
Do you think we were picking on you? I certainly<br/>
didn't think so--generally when I pick on someone,<br/>
they know it. <br/>

 </span></blockquote>Look, I'm not exactly sure why you're upset, but you<br/>
shouldn't take anything personally. As far as I can<br/>
tell nothing was directly aimed at you--unless you are<br/>
upset about comments about spelling and grammar. And<br/>
being as you still refuse to spell out the word "u" or<br/>
use capital letters, that can't be bothering you too<br/>
much. <br/>
<br/>

someone, to point them in a direction that will engender respect rather than <br/>
derision *IS* compassion. It would be far easier to assume that someone is <br/>
an ignorant uneducated lout not worth the bandwidth to reply to. It's called <br/>
positive peer pressure.<br/>

Peasants weren't allowed to have weapons. Well, that's<br/>
the simple version, anyways. <br/>

You can find that all over the world. <br/>

 </span></blockquote>I studied Shotokan for a while, and have a tremendous<br/>
respect for it and Master Funakoshi. And I'm aware of<br/>
his samurai heritage. However, he didn't "INVENT"<br/>
Karate. He adapted it from Okinawan open-hand<br/>
fighting. He DEVELOPED it, but didn't create it. <br/>
<br/>
I belong to the JKAE (japan<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Of course it does. It's going to say it has no ethical<br/>
value system, or mode of behavior? Of course not--it's<br/>
going to use the one it can most easily associate<br/>
with. I'm sure they do their best to incorporate the<br/>
values in Bushido that they feel are worthy. Nothing<br/>
wrong with that. However, that doesn't make karate a<br/>
samurai art based in bushido anymore than my living in<br/>
Shibuya makes me an Edokko.<br/>
<br/>
This is the difference I talked about when I said<br/>
karate became and art, and not simply breaking the<br/>
limbs of an attacker. I hardly think the Okinawan<br/>
peasants who first started putting together techniques<br/>
cared much about bushido--they probably cared a whole<br/>
lot more about other people beating them up and taking<br/>
their crops, etc. If you want to focus on history,<br/>
then take a look at when Master Funakoshi lived--1868<br/>
to 1957. He was born in the same year the Meiji<br/>
Restoration took place, and was a youth when the<br/>
Samurai were abolished. <br/>
<br/>
I suggest YOU study a little bit more about bushido.<br/>
Hardly a pervasive ethical value system through much<br/>
of Japanese history. Fine ideals if you care, but much<br/>
of bushido post-dates the beginning of the Tokugawa<br/>
period, and was hardly the concern of the<br/>
aforementioned Okinawan peasants. <br/>
