<h3>A correction about Daikoku</h3>
by <i>mahamayuri</i>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1562027421">Sorry folks<br/>
<br/>
I was a little upset about statements concerning Japan Classical Schools of<br/>
Buddhism, and din't sent the exactly correct information of Daikoku-Ten<br/>
<br/>
Daikoku-Ten is the japanese translation of the sanskrit Mahâkâla, and is a<br/>
fierce wrathful deity who inhabits cemeteries, an War God called to bestow<br/>
victory over evil and unfair enemies, fight evil spirits, and in some few<br/>
aspects, to ensure prosperity, destroying obstacles.<br/>
<br/>
In Japan, due to the Shinbutsu Shugo phenomena, it was associated with the<br/>
Shinto God Okuninushi no Mikoto (that is my correction), and there is<br/>
worshiped with a shinto image that is not in anyway wrathful, but all<br/>
smilling and happy.<br/>
<br/>
The god of wealth and farmers, Daikoku usually wears a hood and stands on<br/>
bales of rice, carrying a large sack of treasure slung over his shoulder and<br/>
holding a small magic mallet. Daikoku is also the deity of the kitchen and<br/>
provider of food.<br/>
<br/>
In the original wrathful form (away from the Shimbutsu Shugo phenomena and<br/>
its respecive association), he was worshiped in India as a fierce aspect of<br/>
Shiva, but in Buddhism, as one of the Eleven faces of Avalokites'vâra<br/>
Bodhisattva (jap. Juichi-men Kanjizai Bosatsu)<br/>
<br/>
As an warrior's deity, probable it as subject of dedication of some samurais<br/>
who practiced study and austerity on tantric buddhism, like Miyamoto Musashi<br/>
did, dedicating himself to Fudô Myo Ou (Sansk. Acâlanatha Vidyarâja).<br/>
<br/>
As in association with the Shinto Deity Okuninushi no Mikoto, he is one of<br/>
the Seven Gods of Good Fortune (Shichi Fuku-Jin), but I am not able to find<br/>
out if such associated practice of the Seven Gods was just a Japanese<br/>
phenomena derivated from the Shimbutsu Shugo, or if it was in some other<br/>
way, in other countries's vajrayana buddhism (Mahâ Kala is not (under my<br/>
knowledge) present in any other form of devotional buddhism, Sutra Buddhism<br/>
or Dhyana Buddhism or in any of the other schools of Mahayana Buddhism, but<br/>
surelly not in any of theravadim schools)<br/>
<br/>
Sorry for the mistake<br/>
