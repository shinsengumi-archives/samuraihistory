<h3>Taiga Drama</h3>
by <i>lordofkoriyama04</i>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-798050823">Hiya<br/>
<br/>
My name's Neil. I'm new to the group. I've got a favour to ask <br/>
everyone. As most of you will probably know in Japan they produce or <br/>
did produce the historical tv dramas called taiga dramas. <br/>
Unfortunately, being in the UK we don't get them here. Nor do they <br/>
sell copies of them. There are 5 that I'm after in particular. They <br/>
are: <br/>
<br/>
Oda Nobunaga - King of Zipangu<br/>
Hideyoshi<br/>
Tokugawa Ieyasu<br/>
Mori Motonari<br/>
Taiko-ki (which was made in the 60s I think)<br/>
<br/>
I'd also be interested in Takeda Shingen, or there was one about <br/>
Date Masamune but the title isn't Date Masamune. It's something else <br/>
I think. My question is has anyone got copies of any of these and if <br/>
so would they be prepared to sell them to me. <br/>
<br/>
They'd need to be subtitled of course (if subtitled copies exist). <br/>
Regrettably my Japanese is pretty dire!!<br/>
<br/>
If anyone can help me out that'd be great.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks<br/>
<br/>
Neil<br/>
<br/>
PS - dvd or vhs is cool.</div>

<br/>
Of course. They have been making them for the past 41 years. This year is<br/>
the 44th one and its Shinsengumi.<br/>
<br/>
<<There are 5 that I'm after in particular. They<br/>

<br/>

<br/>
Currently being repeated on the Family Channel on Cable here in Japan<br/>
<br/>
<<Tokugawa Ieyasu>><br/>
<br/>
Will be reshown starting in March on the Jidai Geki Channel<br/>
<br/>
Another channel will start showing "Onna Taiko-ki" from 1981 next month.<br/>
These will the first these shows have been repeated. It seems NHK has<br/>
unleashed its archives. What else may be show we will have to wait and see.<br/>
Hideyoshi, Takeda Shingen, and Dokuganryu Masamune (the Date Masamune<br/>
series) were very popular series, so I think there may be agood chance they<br/>
also will be shown soon.<br/>
<br/>
I have the complete Hideyoshi, Mori Motonari and Takeda Shingen series on<br/>
tape. I could copy them but the copies don't come out very well.<br/>
<br/>
You might try and contact a friend in Japan who could tape them. I would but<br/>
I've already got a deal with someone else so my VCR is already doing<br/>
overtime.<br/>
<br/>
They are also available in condensed form (down to 4-10hrs depending on the<br/>
series) on VHS but they are very pricey running up to several hundred<br/>
American Dollars. There have also been some complete series done on DVD. Do<br/>
some searches for NHK and the series titles to see what you can find.<br/>
However these are not subtitled.<br/>
<br/>
<<Taiko-ki (which was made in the 60s I think)>><br/>
<br/>
1965 to be exact.</div>
