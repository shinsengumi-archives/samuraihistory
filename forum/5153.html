 </span></blockquote>Not a dumb question, but it had JUST been discussed.<br/>
It was like a scene out of some teen movie:<br/>
<br/>
Board:<br/>
"Hara Kiri and Seppuku are different. Here's why:..."<br/>
<br/>
You:<br/>
"Hey, are hara-kiri and seppuku different? how?"<br/>
<br/>
99% of questions aren't dumb--if you don't know, how<br/>
are you going to find out if you don't ask? But next<br/>
time, please just go to the message list in the Yahoo<br/>
group and read what's been posted, so we don't repeat<br/>
the same messages 3 times. <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Thanks,<br/>
