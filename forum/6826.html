<h3>Scholarship in Italian on Japanese History</h3>
by <i>cepooooo</i>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1667968261">I am trying to find out what is the status of contemporary scholarship <br/>
about Japanese history in Italy. If there is any Italian in this list <br/>
(I guess there are two or three) would you please update me?<br/>
I am basically done with my MA in Japanese history, and I would like to <br/>
try to publish something in my native language (even thou I haven't <br/>
been living in Italy for more than 15 years...)<br/>
Perhaps, since this discussion might be non-interesting for most <br/>
subscribers, it is better if you write to me in private (in Italian is <br/>
ok).<br/>
Thanks, ciao<br/>
