<h3>2003 Taiga Drama</h3>
by <i>William Letham</i>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1784758871">I heard from a friend that next years NHK Taiga drama will be about Tokugawa Ieyasu. She wasn't sure exactly. I thought it odd because they had already done Tokugawa Ieyasu in 1983 as well as 2000s Aoi Tokugawa Sandai. Has anybody heard anything about this?<br/>

 </span></blockquote>It was on the news a week or two ago.  It's not on Ieyasu, I forget the<br/>
name off the top of my head, but it is about one of the legendary<br/>
swordsmen...<br/>
