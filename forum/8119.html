 </span></blockquote>That's true, it's how it is edited and reviewed that makes the <br/>
difference, not the electrons or paper that make up the substance. One <br/>
advantage of books from reputable academic publishers is they usually <br/>
try to keep the real garbage from getting out since it can damage their <br/>
name. They use real reviewers that check the book out before its <br/>
published as well as having a professional editor take a crack at it. <br/>
With self published books, its a crap shoot if you get anything decent <br/>
or not. I have some great books on various craft subjects that are self <br/>
published but I've also seen some incredible vanity press dribble as <br/>
well. Also even the best authors benefit from at least a little editing.<br/>
<br/>
If you have access to a college library, many of them now allow you to <br/>
read academic journals online, even if its not one that they subscribe <br/>
to. In my case the City of San Jose and Cal State San Jose library are a <br/>
combined library so I can access the databases at the library. I'm not a <br/>
student, otherwise I could access them from home!<br/>
<br/>
In California and parts of Nevada, LINK+ gets you almost overnight <br/>
access to many library's collections.<br/>
<br/>
Having checked out other states library sites, many other states have <br/>
similar setups. If your serious, it makes a nice day trip to hit your <br/>
somewhat local large library!<br/>

-------------------------------------<br/>
I know we're getting a tad ot here but to clarify epublished does not mean self-published though mine are. Believe me it's not just the best authors that need the editing. My spelling ld causes me fits of corrections even after sending out announcements<br/>
