In order to redeem oneself, technically, I believe one must first commit an<br/>
offense requiring redemption - and if you have done so, it was certainly not<br/>
in my presence (literal or cyber-).  And indeed, my fondness for my Chen<br/>
blades may leave me in a position calling for redemption all my own, among<br/>
some of the greater purists on the list.  I'll check that site, in truth,<br/>
when I have my brain back.  I'm coming down with the flu, and at present I<br/>
feel as though I've been randomly fined about half my wits.<br/>
I appreciate the suggestion, as I'm always glad to find sources for decent<br/>
blades.  A month does not go by without some student asking me for a good<br/>
source.<br/>
Blessings and good faring,<br/>

P.S.  And I too have a little familiarity with Eliade's work, by the by.<br/>
Not a name I was expecting to come across here.<br/>

  Hello Gereg,<br/>
<br/>
  I'm sorry I rushed to write about that site, because on further<br/>
examination, I have discovered that it is a fake. My mistake...Thank<br/>
you for helping me and tell me what do you think of this site:<br/>
www.jidai.jp, although I'm having difficulties at this time buying a<br/>
300 Euros sword...So the site is just a dream, besides, since I don't<br/>
take any Kendo or any alike, I wouldn't know what to do with a sword,<br/>
but to admire its beauty.<br/>
<br/>
  Sorry again, and I hope I have redeemed myself in your eyes :)<br/>
<br/>
  Respectfully,<br/>
<br/>

 </span></blockquote>  Why not? A connection can be made between the History of Religions <br/>
and Beliefs and the Ancient Japan, at least regarding the Buddhism, <br/>
don't you think? I have also mentioned it because, ever since I have <br/>
read my first book by him (his "Shortsided Teenager Diary" - <br/>
approximated translation), he has become a "role-model" for me. It <br/>
was the concept of "encyclopedic knowledge" that he promoted I found <br/>
most appealing.<br/>
<br/>
  And about swords, I have sooooo infinite more to learn about them <br/>
until I can even begin to grasp the possibility of acquiring one. For <br/>
the time being, I just dream...<br/>
