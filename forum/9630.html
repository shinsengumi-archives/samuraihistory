<h3>Iyeysu Tokugawa and the Europeans - Classroom Simulation</h3>
by <i>peterruhan</i>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-2115135982">Hello, I am a history teacher in California, and I am attempting to<br/>
create a historical simulation regarding Iyeysu and the closing off of<br/>
Japan to Europeans.  I am attempting to find out some histories or<br/>
records of the events.  I would particularly like to know some of the<br/>
prominent families/personas of the Tokugawa period alive in the early<br/>
1600's.  <br/>
<br/>
I have the following list<br/>
<br/>
Iyeysu Tokugawa<br/>
Mori Terumoto<br/>
Uyesugi<br/>
Date Masamune<br/>
Yamnanouchi<br/>
Ukita<br/>
Satake<br/>
<br/>
I need 2 more and/or comments on the families listed.  I already have<br/>
hit the Samurai Archives for family history.  More help and direction<br/>
would be, well....helpful.<br/>
<br/>
Many thanks,<br/>

 </span></blockquote>There is just one fundamental problem with all of this, although your <br/>
idea sounds like a lot of fun. Ieyasu did not close-off Japan. It was <br/>
his grandson, the third Tokugawa Shogun, Iemitsu, who ultimately <br/>
closed Japan to all but the Dutch, Chinese and Koreans.<br/>
<br/>
There are numerous books that touch upon this subject. I would <br/>
recommend one of the general survey-type history books that George <br/>
Sansom wrote on Japan for starters. Volume 3 of his trilogy should do <br/>
the trick.</div>

I am hoping to set the simulation during the 1614 edict occasion rather than the later ban on all nationals which as you said is by the 3rd shogun of the Tokugawa.  I realize the meeting never really took place where European officials would be allowed to "make their case", but the simulation should be an excellent occasion to see some key cultural and economic issues come to a head.<br/>

I suppose my most difficult task is to find basically about 8 prominent daimyo that the students can represent as Iyeysu's "court"<br/>
