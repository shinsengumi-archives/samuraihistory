forgot the name of the author, it will give you a good feeling for the <br/>
evolution of Japanese politics in this period. Also why being a peasant <br/>
sucks!<br/>

<h3>History Channel Samurai Special</h3>

<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-698461110">I do not know if this has been discussed on this list before (I am new!)<br/>
But the History Channel is airing a special on the Samurai.  <br/>
<br/>

<br/>
The Samurai<br/>
<br/>
     <br/>
<br/>
     <br/>
<br/>
      Monday, December 8 @ 9pm ET/PT  <br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
The knights of medieval Japan, the Samurai held power for over 700 years.<br/>
Ferocious in combat, these masters of sword and bow were bound by an<br/>
unforgiving code of ethics. Their legacy of martial artistry, ceremony,<br/>
self-discipline, and tenacity persists. Explore the history and mystery of<br/>
this elite warrior class as present-day Samurai demonstrate their ancient<br/>
skills in this 2-hour special, and historians and experts examine the<br/>
meaning and ritual of Bushido--the way of the warrior.  TV PG<br/>
