<h3>Japan and Her People NOW AVAILABLE</h3>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-675428207">At long last, "Japan and Her People" is now available.  You can find<br/>
it here:<br/>

<br/>
This is what I've been working on for the last 5 months or so.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks to everyone who helped out - I think the printer put it up<br/>
before we had an "acknowledgements" section, so Nagaeyari might want<br/>
to hold off for a couple weeks before buying it :P<br/>
<br/>
So, anyway, help support the samurai archives and the future Journal<br/>
by picking up a copy.  It should be worth your time.  You can either<br/>
pick it up online at amazon.com, barnesandnoble.com, or you can order<br/>
it at a barnes and noble store - just be sure you are picking up the<br/>
correct book, there seem to be a few out there with the same title.</div>
