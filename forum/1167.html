         My friend is taking an intro to Japan course at UT Austin and he <br/>
missed a lecture because he was sick that day.  We found out all the info <br/>
that he missed except one vocabulary word.  If anyone one call tell us who or <br/>
what a Meisho is from the feudal era of Japanese history ASAP, it would be <br/>
greatly appreciated.<br/>

From what I've seen, and you can check this website out for yourself... at <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.scaruffi.com/politics/japanese.html">http://www.scaruffi.com/politics/japanese.html</a>  it is a timeline of Japan.<br/>
It says that Meshio was an emperor between 1630-1643.  I believe that might be the answer you are looking for.<br/>

<h3>Re: Meisho</h3>

<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1935789268">Hi.<br/>
You will have to show the context which includes that word.But If it <br/>
reffers to the Emperor Meisho,She was a daughter of the Emperor <br/>
Gomizunoo and Tokugawa Masako,who was the daughter of Tokugawa <br/>
Hidetada(the 2nd shogun of Edo Shogunate).<br/>
<br/>
Another possibility is that it means "famous generals" as Tony said.<br/>
<br/>
Hope this helps<br/>
