<h3>Article: Many faces of Takeshi</h3>

<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-850216591">Many faces of Takeshi<br/>
September 3, 2004<br/>
<br/>
Actor, film maker, lunatic? Deborah Cameron reports on a Japanese <br/>
chameleon.<br/>
<br/>
Suicide blond or raven-haired. Hyperactive comic or serious actor. <br/>
Flim-flam television lunatic or master movie maker. Even in Japan, <br/>
his home, there is confusion about the real Takeshi.<br/>
<br/>
It doesn't help that he goes by two names: Beat Takeshi for the daft <br/>
incarnation and Takeshi Kitano for the lofty other. As Beat, he was <br/>
one half of a television comedy duo. As Kitano, the director and <br/>
eponymous star of the samurai movie, Zatoichi, he was last year <br/>
awarded the Silver Lion at the Venice Film Festival. <br/>
<br/>
Zatoichi is a samurai period drama involving two geisha with <br/>
murderous intent. The central character, Zatoichi, is a masseur, <br/>
master swordsman and so cold that the temperature shifts whenever the <br/>
camera catches him. As if being blind were not enough, his peroxided <br/>
hair and blood-red cane (concealing a long blade) ensure that he is <br/>
the most memorable player in the fight scenes. <br/>
<br/>
"I get questions about influence from other films," Takeshi told <br/>
Midnight Eye, a Japanese magazine. "But I really don't watch enough <br/>
films to be influenced by them. I've been asked whether the tap-dance <br/>
scene was influenced by Bollywood movies, but I've never seen any <br/>
Bollywood films in my life." The tap dancing was more influenced by <br/>
the Japanese dance form in kabuki, in which dancers wear wooden <br/>
sandals, he said. And as for the violence, he claims the only ones <br/>
who ask about it are foreign media.<br/>
<br/>
"When I show it (violence), it hurts," he told Midnight Eye. "I don't <br/>
want people to think it's just a game. If you compare my films to <br/>
something like Die Hard, the death toll in my films is pretty low. <br/>
But in a swordplay film, violence and deaths are unavoidable."<br/>
<br/>
In the Japanese film industry, Takeshi is a major force and listed <br/>
alongside the legendary director Akira Kurosawa (whose daughter, <br/>
Kazuko, designed the costumes for Zatoichi). Some suggest that <br/>
Takeshi is Kurosawa's heir, citing a letter that Takeshi got from the <br/>
late Kurosawa the year before his death. "I leave the Japanese film <br/>
industry to you," Kurosawa wrote. Takeshi, now 58, had many escapades <br/>
as a younger man when drinking, strife with his wife and other women <br/>
and a near-fatal scooter crash in 1994 made him fodder for gossip <br/>
magazines.<br/>
<br/>
The accident seems to have tamed him - though not enough to win <br/>
admirers at the Japan Film Academy, which, despite his skill and <br/>
fame, has never honoured him. Why?<br/>
<br/>
The most likely explanation is that some cannot stomach his other <br/>
life as Beat Takeshi, the vulgarian. During this phase, especially in <br/>
the '80s, he was a TV bad boy. He swore, flashed his genitals, made <br/>
lewd jokes, was cruel, parodied the establishment, showed up to the <br/>
studio drunk and threw convention out like stale fish. His role <br/>
opposite David Bowie as the sadistic camp official, Hara, in the 1983 <br/>
film Merry Christmas, Mr Lawrence did not alter their opinion. <br/>
<br/>
Zatoichi is now screening.<br/>

<h3>Sword Suppliers</h3>
by <i>deanwayland</i>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1615983682">Hi Folks,<br/>
<br/>
I'm in need of some advice on iaito sword suppliers. Until now I've been<br/>
getting mine for my group from a UK dealer, <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.ninecircles.co.uk">http://www.ninecircles.co.uk</a><br/>
who, recently found it necessary to switch his Japanese suppliers, which<br/>
has made getting custom fittings impossible. <br/>
<br/>
So, I've been trolling my way across the web looking for alternative<br/>
suppliers, and I'd like to know people's opinions about any of the ones<br/>
that I've found so far, see below.<br/>
<br/>
I'm not interested in the iaito blades themselves, just the fittings, as<br/>
for our purposes the blades of these weapons are too soft. I get custom<br/>
made steel ones manufactured here in the UK by local smiths using the<br/>
standard iaito blade as a pattern, they then mount the new blade with<br/>
the imported fittings. I'm looking for everything else: habaki, seppa,<br/>
tsuba, tsuka, fuchi-kashira, menuki, saya and sageo.<br/>
<br/>
I'm also looking for anyone dealing in tanto, yari, tachi and even no-<br/>
dachi (if such exist), or someone who would be able to produce extra<br/>
long tsuka and saya for such big weapons, ideally with tachi style<br/>
fittings. Man this is a tall order:-)<br/>
<br/>
Anyway, my list so far:<br/>
<br/>
1 "Sword Store" <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.swordstore.com">http://www.swordstore.com</a><br/>
<br/>
2 "Minosaka" <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.jidai.jp">http://www.jidai.jp</a><br/>
<br/>
3 "Nishijin" <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://japanesesword.net/eng/index.html">http://japanesesword.net/eng/index.html</a><br/>
<br/>
4 "Meirin" <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.nipponto.co.jp/english/iai_e.htm">http://www.nipponto.co.jp/english/iai_e.htm</a><br/>
<br/>
5 "Tozando" <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.tozando.com">http://www.tozando.com</a><br/>
<br/>
As I do not speak any Japanese, having a heads-up on the above, before I<br/>
go throwing other people's money at them would be really appreciated.<br/>

<br/>
  Half a dozen of the members of my dojo (including myself) have dealt with <br/>
Tozando.  Their quality and options are rather nice, especially since you <br/>
can get the fittings from the Nishijin Sword site (their sister company).  <br/>
However, the language barrier does cause issues.  Every one of us had a <br/>
problem with our final product.  Some of us had the wrong tsuba.  Some had <br/>
the wrong sam�.  All minor things, for sure, but sill issues nonetheless.  I <br/>
was the only one who was determined enough to get what I had ordered so I <br/>
had to mail the tsuka back to Japan for the proper menuki to be attached.<br/>
  In general they are a good company.  You just have to be prepared to deal <br/>
with minor problems and to not be surprised if you have to send something <br/>
back.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Peace,<br/>
<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-2088735101">Hi Matt,<br/>
<br/>
Cheers, that's really useful info. In terms of having to send stuff back<br/>
to Japan, I'm familiar with the situation, we ordered a wakizashi last<br/>
year, we got the wrong habaki and like you the wrong menuki, so back it<br/>
went. Its still got the wrong habaki, but the menuki got fixed! Oh well,<br/>
at least this is something we can correct further down the road.<br/>
<br/>
With much thanks<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-937061500">Hi Carlo, <br/>
<br/>
Thanks again for the advice, I went and had a look at the site you<br/>
suggested but sadly, my computer can't handle the forum format. My<br/>
eyesight being very (very) poor, means that I use some special text<br/>
enlargement and speech-out packages, which read everything on the page,<br/>
which as I recently told someone else, means absolutely "everything",<br/>
which is a bit of a problem, hence I tend to stick with email format<br/>
groups like this one.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks again to everyone who chipped in to answer my query.<br/>
<br/>
Yours<br/>
<br/>
Dean<br/>

<h3>R: [samuraihistory] Sword Suppliers</h3>
by <i>Carlo Tacchini</i>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1528306221">That Forum is a part of another, huge Forum, Swordforum International.<br/>
<br/>
I quote from their introduction :<br/>
<br/>
"At the heart of SFI is a volunteer effort, a labor of love. We<br/>
originally funded SFI's operational expenses out of our own incomes from<br/>
the technology sector outside of our volunteer work with SFI."<br/>
<br/>
Many of them have as main job the World Wide Web and its applications.<br/>
I belive an E-mail to the administrator ( <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="mailto:sfiadmin@...">sfiadmin@...</a> )<br/>
could give you the solution. Might be a little, may feeware, application<br/>
could solve the matter.  <br/>
Is one of the hugest and better frequented Forum about swords you can<br/>
find.<br/>
<br/>
This is the link to the main page :<br/>
<br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://swordforum.com/">http://swordforum.com/</a><br/>
<br/>
Again the link to the administrator, that you should contact to try to<br/>
find a solution :<br/>
<br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="mailto:sfiadmin@...">sfiadmin@...</a><br/>
 <br/>
Hope to be of some help.<br/>
Take care,<br/>
<br/>
Carlo <br/>
