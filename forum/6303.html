	I think you've expressed Nate's essential philosophical view here, in fact, and rather better than he's done so far.  And you make a very good case for it.  But I truly don't think it's projection.  (For that matter, I tend to think the same of feline and canine emotions:  they're not the same as human emotions, to be sure, but as far as I can tell, they're not as far removed from it as a lot of folks seem to think, either.)  I could be mistaken, to be sure, but I've experimented with the possibility of projection - it is, after all, the most culturally obvious one - and it simply doesn't feel right.  It doesn't seem to accurately describe the sensations that take place in a sword's proximity, let alone in the handling.  More close to the mark might be - note I say "might" - the idea that we are capable of endowing objects technically regarded as inanimate with a certain degree of self and spirit, under certain circumstances.  That's one I'm not quite prepared to swallow, myself, but I acknowledge that it could be the case.  If this is projection, however, it's a lasting variety well beyond the ordinary usage of the term.<br/>
However, I appreciate the voice of moderation.<br/>

  A little strong I'd say. Let's take a different approach. You pick up<br/>
*something* that you are trained to handle. The weight, balance and feel are<br/>
perfect for *you*, not in any way you can express. Something subliminal.<br/>
Then that object *speaks* to you. I know I felt that way the first time I<br/>
picked up a Glock 19 (and proceeded to put an extended clip in a silver<br/>
dollar sized circle at 30 yards. Some of my best shooting ever). Sure a<br/>
standard issue M1911A1 will do the job, but it doesn't feel the same. For<br/>
the same reason I haven't bought a takeyumi at Asahi. Nothing there *spoke*<br/>
to me. As a craftsman, lots of things *speak* to me on some level. I expect<br/>
it's projection, like people ascribing human emotions to thier pets.<br/>
<br/>
  I wouldn't worry about it unless the gollum conversations begin. ;)<br/>

Subject: Re: The Last Samurai, the movie. To: Tony Bryant<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
hello tony,<br/>
  com'on man,...it was pretty good.?? I've seen a handful "samurai" movies in the past, (and yes, they might portray samurai a little better) but this is the 2000's, not the 1900's (lol). People like to see cool stuff like the Last Samurai even if it isn't all that accurate. You can't tell me you've seen any better Samurai "battle" scenes in another movies from the past?? (if so, please let me know so i can watch them). I think it was a great movie to boost the Samurai history for people of today. It taught a lot of people to respect them for who they were/are. I know my friends,(who hate history stuff & think i'm a dork for liking it) thought it was an awesome movie. They were like...."Wow, those guys could really kick butt" I don't know,....maybe i'm wrong??? All i know is that the movie gave me even more insentive to practice kendo and TRY to make my own samurai armour(still in the making,....delayed temp. b/c of my newborn  2 weeks old). Tony, just watch it again and tell me that<br/>
 those battle scenes don't want to make you get up, build a time machine, go back to yrs.1300-1600, join a samurai clan(hopefully a good one), and fight in a huge battle!!!!!!!!!! Plus, Japanese back then were only like 4ft. tall so you already got a huge hieght advantage(lol). Well, my times up. Have a good one.<br/>
                                                             Yours,<br/>
                                                                Mark<br/>

 </span></blockquote>They lie. There is so much that's wrong with it historically that I almost<br/>
cried. Yeah, the armour's pretty. Yeah, the battles are fancy. But historically<br/>
it was totally crapola.<br/>
<br/>
Frankly, I'd think that Watanabe Ken and Sanada Hiroyuki ought to be<br/>
embarrassed. They've each made dozens of films -- some crappy, some really good<br/>
-- and the one they get international reputations for is this American "Dances<br/>
With Samurai" piece of steaming, fetid poop.<br/>
<br/>
I finally caught it on HBO last night, after months and months of refusing to go<br/>
pay to see it, rent it, or buy it.<br/>
<br/>
It made me sick.<br/>

I have hardly earned the right to address this forum.  However, I would<br/>
like to point out a book entitled "The Last Samurai" by Professor Mark<br/>
Ravina(sp?).  I believe that this book gives an albeit abbreviated<br/>
synopsis of the actual events.<br/>
<br/>
Sincerely,<br/>
James Hisatake<br/>
