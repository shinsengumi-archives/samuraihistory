<h3>question: dishonorable samurais</h3>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1113596941">I was simply saying province or daimyo controlling the province depending on how you wished to say it.  I did not intend to make them appear to be the same.<br/>

~~~~hi! ^_^ i am completely aware that you were knowledgeable at that matter. <br/>
actually, i am a newbie at this and i am on research.if you know the answer to my question below, i would really be grateful. ^_^<br/>
<br/>
question:<br/>
~~~i have read that a daimyo gives a samurai benefits for fighting and protecting his land. in case the daimyo becomes injured, paralyzed or sick, can a powerful and strong samurai sort-of rebel, in such a way that he would demand more benefits from the disabled daimyo? i know that he could be severely punished for this but what if his fellow samurais support him? is that possible? i know that they have their code but what if there are some dishonorable samurais out there. can they do that?<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-808400515">The best answer to your questions is "yes but..."<br/>
<br/>
    There are many examples of retainers usurping power from their lords, depending on the period, the circumstance and the result we view them as honorable or dishonorable. It isn't cut and dried. The "but" is a big one and what is needed is a good deal of study, a simple answer really isn't possible.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-619840769">I agree.  The answer to that question is not clear cut.  Depending on the time period it did happen but the owners of land were not really warriors persay, but aristocrats who put the care of their land in the hands of warrior families.  This period is known as "the low overcoming the high" this did not happen to all families as some took care of their land themselves or had very loyal "retainers" (Iknow its not the best word for the period but its simple).  This was early on in samurai history and like Tom said would take alot of study to understand and to much space to explain but it is possible, depending.  I know this is simplified but hopefully it will help you to get a simple picture.<br/>

    You most likely want to look at the Sengoku period of Japanese History, roughly 1400 to 1600. I would do an online search or visit a library, there is a wealth of information out there. I am sure that no one here would<br/>
wish to rob you of the pleasure of dicovering it yourself.<br/>
