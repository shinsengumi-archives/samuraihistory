<h3>Takeda Cavalry &quot;Retainers&quot;</h3>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-853536974">Hi,<br/>
<br/>
Most sources in English indicate that, at least until 1575, each of <br/>
the Takeda mounted samurai had two dismounted "retainers."  Does <br/>
anyone know how the "retainters" were utilized?  Did the two follow <br/>
directly on the heels of the mounted man, or were they formed in <br/>
separate units?  Did they wear the typical ashigaru armor or the <br/>
better armor typically associated with what one theinks of <br/>
a "samurai?"  How were they armed?  <br/>
Thanks</div>
