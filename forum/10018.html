 I am currently making a suit of tatami/karutakane armor (my first suit of armor), and I was wondering if I could get any tips or cool photos of various sengoku armor pieces.

<br/>

the finishing is very high.<br/>
<br/>
For a practical fighting armour I'd recommend going with 1.6mm plate if <br/>
you can. When properly shaped they stand up well even if not hardened <br/>
and tempered. Note that the edge of each plate on an iron or steel <br/>
example is turned out a tiny amount so it lays flat(ish) against the <br/>
textile foundation, and the plates are arranged in a series of curved <br/>
lines so that when worn it follows the contours of the body in <br/>
horizontal rows.<br/>

If the armour is of hardened and lacqerred rawhide leather, then <br/>
typically you are looking at using circa 3mm thick hide. Don't forget to <br/>
coat the outer shell with a very thin layer of car body filler before <br/>
lacquering. Okay the Japanese didn't use car body filler, but it's the <br/>
closest thing you can get to the compound of stone and other stuff that <br/>
they did use:-) This will give you a fine smooth surface to paint.<br/>

<h3>Re: [samuraihistory] Tatami-dou Tosei Gusoku</h3>
by <i>deanwayland</i>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-161168191">Hi Takezo-san,<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> >Thanks for the tips.  You have no idea how much that helps.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>My pleasure, knowledge is for sharing.<br/>
<br/>
And yes I think I have a rough idea of how much it helps, as having <br/>
someone tell me this information when I started would have saved an <br/>
awful lot of frustration!<br/>
<br/>
I was thinking about the last time I was involved in making some armour <br/>
similar to this, a Kote (sleeve), and thought I'd pass on what we <br/>
learned that would be of benefit to you (and anyone else reading this <br/>
post).<br/>
<br/>
So, here's one more tip:<br/>
<br/>
When making the foundation layer of fabric, you'll need three layers, <br/>
ideally two of hemp or linen and one of hessian (sack cloth).<br/>
<br/>
1.  Sew the outer shell to the hessian.<br/>
<br/>
2. Make up a wooden frame, like that for a picture, pin the sewn panel <br/>
to it, to keep it taught while you sew the finished metalwork to it. <br/>
That way you don't get any wrinkles or folds accidentally permanently <br/>
under the armour. They would drive you nuts when you wear it!.<br/>
<br/>
BTW use a simple running stitch through the flat round rings of the <br/>
armour. Otherwise you will be sewing forever! See #5<br/>
<br/>
3. Remove from the frame and cut it to shape.<br/>
<br/>
4. Sew a narrow leather or textile edging about 20-25m wide around the <br/>
edge of the foundation, so that the edging fabric and the foundation's <br/>
edges match up. This will mean that the edging lays over the top of the <br/>
armour at this stage.<br/>
<br/>
5. Now "paint" the back of the hessian with a thin layer of PVA glue <br/>
(they would have used rice or fish glue, but you don't want to go <br/>
there). This glues the threads holding the armour in position, so that <br/>
when one breaks the whole thing won't unravel. This is why you don't <br/>
have to sew each plate individually. Seeing how the Japanese had done <br/>
this was a real revelation, as we had originally thought the sewing <br/>
would take forever. Back then labour was cheap, so we thought it wasn't <br/>
a problem - for them. This short cut really saves a tremendous amount of <br/>
time, and for the Japanese it would have enabled them to make these <br/>
armours by the tens of thousands.<br/>
<br/>
6. Now cut out and lay the inner lining on the back of the armour.<br/>
<br/>
7. Fold the edging leather or fabric back on itself and sew through it <br/>
and all the fabric. This means that from the outside of the armour you <br/>
won't see any stitching on the edging material, as it is covered by the <br/>
folded back leather. The stitches that close the whole thing up are <br/>
ideally running parallel to the edging fabric, but not through it on the <br/>
front face.  Again use a simple running stitch to in effect tack it <br/>
closed.<br/>
<br/>
The idea is three fold, to protect the stitching holding the armour in <br/>
place from abrasion, by firstly having the entire back free of exposed <br/>
threads, and secondly by having the thickened edge of leather or what <br/>
ever you use to shield the edge thread from harm. Finally, and so <br/>
typically Japanese, to permit the lining to be easily removed for <br/>
washing:-)<br/>
<br/>
BTW if you need to access the inside to do repairs, all you have to do <br/>
is unpick the closest edge and move the lining aside.<br/>
<br/>
This knowledge was acquired with the help of Ian Bottomley formally of <br/>
the Royal Armouries, and Mike Jessop, former keeper of the Wade <br/>
Collection at Snowshill Manor, who over several year's arranged access <br/>
for myself and Dave Gavin, to closely study various Tatami Do and other <br/>
pieces. The least I can do is pass the information around, otherwise <br/>
it's just a self-indulgent waste.<br/>
<br/>
Anyway, hope this helps, and all the best with your project.<br/>
<br/>
Dean<br/>
