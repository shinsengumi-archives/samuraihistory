At Egyptian Theatre<br/>
<br/>
Friday, September 9, 2005: Egyptian Theatre The Friday, September <br/>
9th program begins at 7:30 PM with a Double Feature.<br/>
<br/>
First up is a new 35 mm. print of THREE OUTLAW SAMURAI (SANBIKI NO <br/>
SAMURAI), (1964, Janus Films, 95 min.). Director Hideo Gosha's first <br/>
feature film is not only one of the most-assured directorial debuts <br/>
ever, it is also something of a holy-grail for samurai movie <br/>
aficionados, as it's been notoriously hard-to-see outside of Japan <br/>
since its initial release - until now. Janus Films just made a <br/>
glorious new 35 mm. print of this treasure, in time for our series!  <br/>
Wandering samurai Tetsuro Tanba is swayed into helping those who <br/>
can't fend for themselves, in this case starving farmers who have <br/>
kidnapped a local lord's daughter in protest over unfair taxes. In <br/>
the process, much blood is shed, and two other swords-for-hire <br/>
(Mikijiro Hira, Isamu Nagato) become reluctant draftees into Tanba's <br/>
band of rebels. Gosha's use of the B&W Cinemascope frame is <br/>
astonishing, with a down-to-earth, hardboiled ambience rarely seen <br/>
in early 1960s samurai pictures. Add to that Toshiaki Tsushima's <br/>
atmospheric score and you have a certifiable classic.<br/>
<br/>
Next on the same bill is GOYOKIN (aka OFFICIAL GOLD aka STEEL EDGE <br/>
OF REVENGE), (1969, Toho, 121 min.). Director Hideo Gosha's samurai <br/>
masterpiece is an unrelenting vision of snow and fire, ravens <br/>
screeching and swords flashing in the darkness. Tatsuya Nakadai <br/>
stars as a conscience-stricken samurai tortured by his involvement <br/>
in a past massacre and determined to prevent another. Gosha was <br/>
forced to reshoot half the film when original co-star Toshiro Mifune <br/>
walked out (apparently because of the fierce cold!) - and the cold <br/>
in GOYOKIN is, in truth, all-consuming, freezing hands to swords. A <br/>
bold, beautifully-shot film.  With Tetsuro Tanba, Ruriko Asaoka.<br/>
