 </span></blockquote>Where do you get "batsu"? I can think of a number of<br/>
meanings for "batsu" (X being one of them) but clan<br/>
isn't one of them. Most places I've seen "uji" ��.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>   My guess is that he's thinking of 閥 (batsu; meaning clique, clan, <br/>
faction).<br/>
<br/>
   I'm not sure about specific Sengoku-era usage, but my Japanese books <br/>
on Sengoku history tend to favour "-shi" (氏: uji, shi) as a suffix <br/>
appended to the family name of the head of the clan. I also see "-ke" <br/>
(家: ie, ya, uchi, ka, ke) and occasionally "ichizoku" (一族) or the <br/>
"-zoku" part thereof used as a suffix, and even more rarely "ichimon" <br/>
(一門), but I'd be hard pressed to identify the subtle distinctions <br/>
those might have carried during the relevant time period.<br/>
<br/>
   The question, however, doesn't provide sufficient context to provide <br/>
an accurate answer.<br/>

I apologize if you didn't see it. By itself, it can be<br/>
used to mean "the clan". <br/>

you've got Japanese fonts installed, mine should have<br/>
shown up fine under Shift-JIS or Japanese<br/>
(Auto-Select). Unicode is completely impractical if<br/>
you actually type in Japanese, which I frequently do<br/>
(not all that WELL, mind you). Try adjusting your<br/>
encoding and you'll see it fine. There was no "tried"<br/>
there--I did. <br/>
<br/>
Of course, I can also see your entries--I have to go<br/>
to Unicode to do so, though. And it completely messes<br/>
up every single webpage for a while. But to answer<br/>
your question, yes the link you provided is the one I<br/>
typed. <br/>

why you would.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>I did indeed see the kanji as you typed it after switching to shift-jis <br/>
encoding. The problem there was that I have three possible japanese <br/>
encodings, only one of which displays correctly, plus unicode. 4 checks <br/>
just to get one character... I haven't been getting enough sleep lately, <br/>
so I'll just blame it on that.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>I copy/pasted my entries from the website. Apparently Thunderbird <br/>
automatically turned my entire message into utf-8 after that, probably <br/>
because the site was in unicode. I have next to no experience typing <br/>
japanese, so I don't really know what would have happened had I typed it.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>   The wonders of online dictionaries like EDICT is that it allows <br/>
anyone with even rudimentary surfing skills to stumble upon out of <br/>
context obscure terms in languages they know little to nothing about. <br/>
They then usually proceed to use those as is in an extraordinary display <br/>
of linguistic butchery instead of checking, so I think the original <br/>
poster here deserves credit for not just assuming his search yielded the <br/>
correct term.<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>   I really like Thunderbird, but it does seem to be a bit hit or miss <br/>
when it comes to interpreting the correct encoding correctly, so I <br/>
didn't see it at first. (I knew which kanji you meant anyway, I simply <br/>
re-listed it in my reply for the sake of completeness.)<br/>
<br/>
   However, the only times I remember coming across "uji" by itself is <br/>
in texts about the Ritsuryō system or earlier periods, which precede <br/>
samurai history proper by a few centuries.<br/>
<br/>
   As for the choice of UTF-8, since you asked about it so nicely in <br/>
another reply, my main reason for that is that in addition to English, I <br/>
also use French and Japanese, and the letters with macrons from the <br/>
extended character set, fairly regularly, and Unicode handles the <br/>
combined use of both better than other encoding schemes. My second <br/>
choice, if I'm not using macrons or other accented characters but am <br/>
including both English and Japanese, is ISO-2022-JP rather than <br/>
Shift-JIS; that last I use only for reading what other people send in <br/>
that encoding. :)</div>
