<h3>My BBC show finally airs Stateside</h3>

<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1675333815">Apologies if you are getting this multiple times, but I am mass- <br/>
sending this as I wanted to get the news out as widely as possible.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Some of you may have heard about the BBC TV show I did the research  <br/>
for -- on Tokugawa Ieyasu and the Battle of Sekigahara.<br/>
<br/>
If you didn't know, the Readers' Digest version is that some time ago,  <br/>
the Beeb contacted me asking me if I'd like to be their researcher for  <br/>
a docudrama on the Battle of Sekigahara (for which I literally wrote  <br/>
the book), as part of a series on historical military commanders.  <br/>
After .004 seconds of hesitation (just to be polite), I said yes.<br/>
<br/>
The series was broadcast in the UK in February, and finally has made  <br/>
its way Stateside, so I thought my fellow SCAdians might like to see  <br/>
it. It is on the Military History channel.<br/>
<br/>
There's a brief review I did of the final production and some  <br/>
screenshots of it on the Tosando board. It might whet your appetite  <br/>
for it:  <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://military.discovery.com/tv/warriors/episode-guide/episode-guide.html">http://military.discovery.com/tv/warriors/episode-guide/episode-guide.html</a> <br/>
  )<br/>
<br/>
The series itself is about several great historical military leaders  <br/>
at their crossroads: Attila, Cortes, Napoleon, Richard the  <br/>
Lionhearted, Spartacus, and Ieyasu. It's showing this week (starting  <br/>
Friday night with Attila), and my ep on Tokugawa Ieyasu is on this  <br/>
Sunday. (Ironically, the Japanese drama is on Sunday, Dec. 7. Gotta  <br/>
love it.)<br/>
<br/>
About this episode (from their webpage): "Tokugawa Leyasu is a  <br/>
towering figure in Japanese history. He is Oliver Cromwell, Richard  <br/>
The Lionheart and Alfred The Great combined - the man who overthrew  <br/>
the governing dynasty of Japan and established a regime that would  <br/>
last for centuries."<br/>
<br/>
It'll be shown several times.<br/>

<br/>
Historically speaking, it's not perfect -- we had to conflate months  <br/>
of political machinations and maneuvering and conflict into one hour,  <br/>
so some historical personages got rolled into one, and others just  <br/>
aren't there, and there's more reliance on the "bushido" thing than I  <br/>
would have preferred (and there's even a ninja attack that I BEGGED  <br/>
them not to do) but it's still a stunning production, and all things  <br/>
considered I'm pleased and proud to have been attached to it. I don't  <br/>
know what is going to have to be cut out for the US release to make  <br/>
room for commercials, and I really worry about that -- there is NO fat  <br/>
in the show that can easily be trimmed. The UK version was 59 minutes  <br/>
long, and that was barely enough to do some semblance of justice to  <br/>
the story.<br/>
<br/>
Watch the episode, and then tell yourself "they did this with only 75  <br/>
extras and 25 horses" and be amazed. Even Japanese TV had spots about  <br/>
it on their news programs expressing surprise and admiration for the  <br/>
quality and scale of the production given what the budget was. (Heck,  <br/>
just look at the screen shots!)<br/>
<br/>
Check out the show, and let me know you what you think.<br/>
