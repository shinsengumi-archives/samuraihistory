	I should like to help you but first perhaps you could introduce <br/>
yourself. Who are you, who do you work for or where are you studying <br/>
that you need this kind of info? What is it you hope to learn about the <br/>
Buke (Samurai) as a class? What period of history are you interested <br/>
in, most Japanese Grandfathers (of those living) were born after the <br/>
Samurai as a class were abolished. I am sure there is a world of info <br/>
available to you without need for interviews.<br/>
-tom<br/>
<br/>
P.S. surely there are Japanese banks operating in Singapore, walk in to <br/>
any of those and you are likely to meet a descendant of a samurai...<br/>

	Welcome to this list. I think if you will follow the discussion of <br/>
just what is a samurai and what has become of the samurai class going <br/>
on now in other threads here many of your questions will be answered. <br/>
There are no true samurai left, there are many descendants of samurai <br/>
still around and many good tales from the period before the samurai <br/>
class was abolished. Unfortunately there is no one left alive from that <br/>
period, for most people alive today they would have been their Great <br/>
Great Grandparents.<br/>
	Since you work in Radio and need a live body for your work I would <br/>
suggest looking for a Kendo or Iaido dojo in your area. Look for <br/>
Japanese instructors or students born before the war and approach them <br/>
for an interview. Were we in Japan, I could introduce you to many <br/>
interesting characters but alas I am no longer there. Not having met <br/>
you myself I wouldn't feel right sending you to my friends homes and <br/>
not be present myself. I am sure you can find persons of interest right <br/>
there in Singapore...<br/>
