'Emperor of Japan': A Scholar Pieces Together a Life of the Enigmatic <br/>
Meiji<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
To understand contemporary Japan one first has to grasp the<br/>
sweeping social changes of the last half of the 19th<br/>
century. What appeared at the time to set them off was the<br/>
arrival of Commodore Perry's American naval squadron in<br/>
1853. After many attempts by several Western powers to open<br/>
up Japan to trade, Perry finally succeeded in ending<br/>
centuries of Japan's self-imposed isolation. His success<br/>
triggered a crisis of legitimacy. For more than six<br/>
centuries the chief military leaders of Japan, the shoguns,<br/>
had ruled the nation. Since 1603 the hereditary shoguns<br/>
were members of the powerful Tokugawa family, who, while<br/>
they claimed authority in the name of the emperors in<br/>
Kyoto, in fact ran the government as they wanted, from<br/>
their capital in Edo (Tokyo). The regime had become<br/>
ossified through the years, and its inability to resist the<br/>
Western incursion exposed its weakness. Eventually a civil<br/>
war broke out, the feudal shogun system collapsed, and<br/>
imperial rule was restored in 1868. <br/>
<br/>
In 1852, a year before Perry's arrival, a new crown prince,<br/>
Mutsuhito, was born. No one could have foreseen the<br/>
significance this child would assume as a symbol of Japan's<br/>
modernization. As Donald Keene, with muted amusement,<br/>
reveals in ''Emperor of Japan,'' Mutsuhito's upbringing was<br/>
sheltered from the turmoil overtaking his country; it was<br/>
traditional, steeped in the ancient protocol and customs of<br/>
the court. Yet by the time he ascended the throne at 15 he<br/>
was the focus of national aspirations. Traditionally an<br/>
emperor might have several names during his reign and a<br/>
different one after death. This emperor was called Meiji<br/>
(Enlightened Rule) from the beginning, and he, and the<br/>
entire historical era he embodied, have been called Meiji<br/>
ever since. <br/>
<br/>
In practical terms the Meiji Restoration of 1868 did not<br/>
bring about direct rule by the emperor. The new government<br/>
was an oligarchy made up of the senior members of the<br/>
loyalist faction that had overthrown the shogunate. Even<br/>
though the loyalists gained support for their cause by<br/>
promising to expel all foreigners, pragmatism quickly<br/>
displaced impractical idealism. A total makeover of the<br/>
government began promptly, on the model of a modern<br/>
constitutional monarchy. As his first major act, the Meiji<br/>
emperor promulgated the Charter Oath -- five promises to<br/>
the people of Japan to bring fundamental change to the<br/>
political system. Although the promises were general and<br/>
vague, the Charter Oath became the foundational document<br/>
that effectively set the government's course for the rest<br/>
of the Meiji period (1868-1912). <br/>
<br/>
In those 44 years the Meiji state instituted radical<br/>
economic, military and legal reforms. With the tacit<br/>
support of the emperor, the oligarchy ruthlessly swept<br/>
aside old bureaucratic institutions and the feudal class<br/>
structure. It set up new banking and educational systems,<br/>
brought the legal code into line with Western standards and<br/>
established a constitution in 1889 that created a<br/>
parliamentary form of government. Perhaps most important,<br/>
the Meiji oligarchy initiated a march to great-power status<br/>
through policies that encouraged rapid industrialization at<br/>
home and colonialist expansion abroad -- expansion that led<br/>
Japan into war with China in 1894 and with Russia a decade<br/>
later. <br/>
<br/>
The decision to resist the power and hegemony of the West<br/>
by consciously emulating Western cultural forms lies at the<br/>
heart of all of these changes. Some members of the original<br/>
oligarchy, among them Takamori Saigo, once commander of the<br/>
imperial army, disagreed vehemently with this policy, and<br/>
in the early years of the Meiji period the government<br/>
experienced some resistance, most notably in what is known<br/>
as the Satsuma Rebellion of 1877. <br/>
<br/>
Once the young Meiji state had weathered its early crisis<br/>
of legitimacy, however, it did not limit Japan's embrace of<br/>
modernity to the importation of Western institutions and<br/>
material culture. The oligarchy extended its mandate by<br/>
beginning to build an empire in Asia. This mission demanded<br/>
acquiescence in the racial ideologies that sustained<br/>
colonial power, and only the construction of a myth of<br/>
Japanese cultural uniqueness made this situation palatable.<br/>
The result was a strange cultural synthesis, a hybrid of<br/>
Western modernity and a newly created imperial ideology<br/>
that promoted the concept of an essential Japanese culture<br/>
rendered timeless by the unbroken succession of the royal<br/>
line. The fundamental legacy of the Meiji period is thus<br/>
the very idea of a modern Japanese state possessing a<br/>
nationally shared cultural tradition. <br/>
<br/>
Given the eventful nature of his reign, the lack of<br/>
English-language scholarship on this emperor's life is<br/>
surprising. There are many fine books on aspects of the<br/>
history and culture of the Meiji period; and in recent<br/>
years distinguished studies by John Dower and Herbert Bix<br/>
have explored the workings of the modern imperial system<br/>
through an examination of the life of Meiji's grandson,<br/>
Hirohito. The Meiji emperor, however, remains an aloof and<br/>
enigmatic presence whose personal life is largely<br/>
inaccessible even to most modern-day Japanese. <br/>
<br/>
Donald Keene attempts to address this gap in the record --<br/>
''to find Emperor Meiji,'' as he puts it. Few scholars are<br/>
as well qualified to undertake this tremendous project. He<br/>
began his scholarly career in Japanese studies a few years<br/>
after World War II, and he continues to be one of the<br/>
foremost critics and translators of Japanese culture.<br/>
Although he is best known for his extensive writings on<br/>
literature, he is a cultural historian with an encyclopedic<br/>
knowledge of Japan. His special gifts are on display in<br/>
''Emperor of Japan,'' which approaches Meiji's life by<br/>
interweaving two separate but related narratives. Drawing<br/>
on a wide range of sources, including the huge compilation,<br/>
''Records of the Meiji Emperor'' (Meiji tenno ki), Keene<br/>
constructs a year-by-year biography of Meiji's life. A<br/>
second narrative outlining the significant events of the<br/>
Meiji period frames the daily details of the emperor's<br/>
personal affairs. The result is a biography that serves as<br/>
political history. <br/>
<br/>
The appeal of this work lies in the skill with which these<br/>
two narratives are tied together. Although Keene's<br/>
interpretation of the period does not depart radically from<br/>
standard histories, he constantly puts Meiji's life in a<br/>
rich context, and his account is informed by a literary<br/>
sensibility that lets us see major events in a new light.<br/>
Keene maintains a critical balance between his role as a<br/>
historian and his intimate engagement with his subject. His<br/>
book is a history that revels in detail but remains<br/>
accessible, leading us through the complex intricacies of<br/>
court life, political intrigue and international affairs. <br/>
<br/>
It brings us as close to the inner life of the Meiji<br/>
emperor as we are ever likely to get. Does it succeed in<br/>
helping us to find Meiji? Yes and no. And the reservation<br/>
here should remind us of how difficult it is even now for<br/>
us to fit Hirohito into the history of World War II. There<br/>
are personal reasons for what seems to be a mystery about<br/>
the emperors, but cultural reasons as well. Keene's book<br/>
gives a fuller picture of the man Meiji, but a sense of<br/>
distance stubbornly remains. Perhaps this is due to the<br/>
lack of direct commentary on his life by the emperor<br/>
himself. There is a huge archive in Japan about him, but<br/>
scant documentation that reveals how he regarded even the<br/>
most crucial events of his time. Keene provides helpful<br/>
speculations about Meiji's feelings and opinions at<br/>
important moments; but, being a meticulous scholar, he also<br/>
draws attention to the maddening gaps in the record. <br/>
<br/>
In the end, he concludes that perhaps Meiji's greatest<br/>
achievement was the longevity of his reign. But to put the<br/>
stress on that brings the reader back to the problem that<br/>
motivated this study in the first place. Meiji is<br/>
remembered more as a representative figure of an era than<br/>
as an individual because his personal identity largely<br/>
derives from the symbolic nature of emperorship in Japan.<br/>
For the better part of the millennium preceding Meiji's<br/>
reign the primary functions of the emperor were ritual, or<br/>
priestly. By the the middle of the 19th century the<br/>
political ground of imperial legitimacy had become<br/>
routinely symbolic -- a situation in which power flowed<br/>
from the charisma of an institution rather than an<br/>
individual. Meiji remains just beyond the biographer's<br/>
grasp because his life was lived at that vanishing point<br/>
where the public image of the emperor and the private life<br/>
of the man become indistinguishable. <br/>
