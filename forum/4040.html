Mikatagahara, after suffering a serious defeat, Tokugawa Ieyasu had <br/>
the gates of his castle left open, bonfires lit, and drums sounded <br/>
so that his army could easily retreat. The Takeda general Baba <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-434120891">In both Japanese and Chinese cases, it was the<br/>
reputation of both generals that made their<br/>
psychological deception work.<br/>
For Ieyasu, I guess that there is no objection from<br/>
the group memeber here about this point.<br/>
<br/>
As for the Chinese general, his name was Je-Gal<br/>
Gong-Myung. He was a child prodigy who was considered<br/>
mastering in ancient strategy, astrology, mathematics,<br/>
law structure, Taoism, Confucianism, music and<br/>
literature by the time he was recruited by his boss,<br/>
Yu-Bang, the descendent of the royal family of the Han<br/>
empire. He did not even have an actual field<br/>
experience before his first command.<br/>
He fought with most famouse stratetists including Cho<br/>
Cho, the founder of the Wei empire, the great<br/>
strategist and tactician at that time on numerous<br/>
occassions often in scales of over 400,000 force size,<br/>
never lost the war and battles.<br/>

I would feel trembled by the roaring of a lion, but<br/>
probabiliy not by that of a jackal.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1223224368">You were talking about 2 japanese guys getting together and negotiating a surrender without fighting. That IS what Lee and Grant did!!!  Sure, they fought before, but not at this particular time. The part being disagreed with is your statement that one couldn't imagine Lee and Grant getting together for a confab, b/c it was such a different culture or time in history or something to that effect. One can easily "imagine" it (bla-bla-bla, how's that for being overliteral?), especially if they did in fact meet in person to negotiate surrender.<br/>
<br/>
Say, is Robert E. Lee in Nobility of Failure? <snicker><br/>
<br/>
Oh, and Brandon, about the advertising and the military budget, yes, they're connected in a "round about way". Certainly not directly. Don't take my statements as an attack on the us military; they're not. But, I think maybe I'll call my congressman next time I see military commercial... ha-ha.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-173092882">During the Falklands campaign the Parachute Regiment <br/>
overstretched itself and launched an unsupported frontal attack <br/>
from a hilltop upon a heavily defended Argentinian position.<br/>
<br/>
(The account I heard was given by a survivor now running a <br/>
rehab charity for trauma victims.)<br/>
<br/>
The Brits spent a cold, wet, hungry and terrifying night on a <br/>
bare hillside, knowing they would be going in again at first <br/>
light, and knowing they didn't pack enough men nor enough <br/>
firepower to carry the position without a desperate and bloody <br/>
fight. The survivor in question had lost both his best mates, <br/>
(and was sticky with the gore of one of them, who was blown up <br/>
at his side) and held little chance of either their success or <br/>
his own survival.<br/>
<br/>
At first light their major walked down the hillside under a <br/>
white flag. He explained to the Argentinian officer that they <br/>
were Brit Paratroops and his men were champing at the bit to <br/>
'get stuck in'. He further explained that they were going to <br/>
attack within the hour, and that once they did he would not be <br/>
held responsible for the conduct of his men, and quite frankly <br/>
it was likely they would be taking no prisoners. <br/>
<br/>
His best advice to his opposite number was to surrender.<br/>
<br/>
Which is precisely what happened.<br/>
<br/>
The survivor's voice changed audibly when talking of the <br/>
courage and sheer bravura of his officer, he was in awe of the <br/>
man's nerve. No doubt the reputation of the Red Devils went <br/>
before them.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-468130685">I guess that the British Empire and American Republics<br/>
did not earn their fames from nothing. As many other<br/>
powerful peoples who left historic marks(excluding<br/>
MAAAAD Al Queda or equivalently INSAANE terrorists), I<br/>
think that there are many things we can learn from<br/>
each other, especially between the West and the East.<br/>
<br/>
One more thing,(excuse me for my digression, Ahem..)<br/>
though. During World War Two, the power of China had<br/>
been overestimated by the American politicians. Now, I<br/>
have observed the opposite. Her power has been<br/>
underestimated by the comtemporary American<br/>
Politicians and Westerners.<br/>
<br/>
For a bright future for a mankind, I think that<br/>
Westerner should give a proper respect to them.<br/>
I think that this Samurai 'networks' is one of<br/>
channels of communication we can use for better<br/>
understanding each other. <br/>

ps. I am very impressed with what British did in the<br/>
Falklands.<br/>
