(Sengoku Jieitai 1549)<br/>
<br/>
Mark Schilling in Tokyo 06 July 2005 <br/>
  <br/>
Dir: Masaaki Tezuka. Japan. 2005. 119mins.<br/>
<br/>
A remake of Kosei Saito's 1979 film about a military Self Defence <br/>
Forces (SDF) unit that time travels back to the days of the samurai, <br/>
Samurai Commando: Mission 1549 has already attracted a flood of <br/>
foreign rights offers for producer Kadokawa Pictures. Concluded <br/>
deals totalled 31 at last count - a new record for a live-action <br/>
Japanese film.<br/>
<br/>
What director Masaaki Tezuka (Godzilla: Tokyo S.O.S.) delivers on <br/>
the screen is not the camp-fest implied in the title, but a Japanese <br/>
equivalent of Independence Day: full-bore, straight-ahead SF action <br/>
with a nationalistic slant. Also, much of the $15m budget has gone <br/>
to effects that may be more 1996 than 2005 but are still of-the-line <br/>
for a Japanese release.<br/>
<br/>
Samurai Commando has become a solid hit in Japan following its June <br/>
1 release, and internationally looks likely to draw the same teenage <br/>
males who thrilled to The Last Samurai (if not the women who <br/>
thrilled to Tom Cruise). Success, though, will depend on how much <br/>
the international version also commissioned by Kadokawa, with its <br/>
pumped-up effects and soundtrack, can reduce the original film's <br/>
cheese factor.<br/>
<br/>
The action starts with a top-secret test of a new magnetic shield - <br/>
and a blunder by the second lieutenant in charge, one Rei Kanzaki <br/>
(Kyoka Suzuki) that sends an SDF unit reeling back in time.<br/>
<br/>
The SDF brass covers up the incident, but two years later the space-<br/>
time continuum begins to warp - and they decide to dispatch a squad, <br/>
coded named Romeo, into the year 1549. Their mission: rescue the <br/>
missing soldiers - and save Japan (not to mention the Solar System) <br/>
from being sucked into the void.<br/>
<br/>
Squad leader Kashima (Yosuke Eguchi) is a reluctant warrior, as is <br/>
his second in command, the stern-visaged Kanzaki. But when they <br/>
finally travel back to 1549 they discover that the unit leader, <br/>
Colonel Matoba (Takeshi Kaga), has assumed the identity of a famous <br/>
warlord - and is planning to fast-forward Japan to world power <br/>
status with the aid of a city-obliterating secret weapon.<br/>
<br/>
Made with the co-operation of the SDF, Samurai Commando offers all <br/>
the money shots of helicopters, tanks, and other hardware that <br/>
military buffs, not to mention SDF recruiters, could desire.<br/>
<br/>
It also skips boring exposition, plunging immediately into the <br/>
action. Wave after wave of samurai are blasted to writhing <br/>
smithereens by modern firepower - but the survivors charge on <br/>
regardless. Meanwhile, the SDF troops take their share of deadly, <br/>
realistically rendered CG arrows.<br/>
<br/>
There are other neat effects, such as the SDF unit and all its <br/>
hardware being whirled into the past like Dorothy's house in The <br/>
Wizard Of Oz. But they cannot disguise Tezuka's pedestrian direction <br/>
and the lack of emotional range, beyond grim determination.<br/>
<br/>
Instead of expressing awe and astonishment at the sudden appearance <br/>
of 21st century technology in their midst, Tezuka's samurai <br/>
immediately and mindlessly go on the attack, like bad guys in a <br/>
computer game.<br/>
<br/>
Meanwhile, the SDF heroes barely notice their feudal-era <br/>
surroundings; they are like Japanese salarymen sent on business to a <br/>
dangerous Third World country, whose only thought is to make it back <br/>
to the airport intact and on time.<br/>
<br/>
Among the standouts in the main cast is Kazuki Kitamura, playing a <br/>
samurai who time travels in the opposite direction and becomes a <br/>
Romeo ally. After a long slog through the straight-to-video <br/>
underworld, Kitamura finally has a mainstream platform for his <br/>
Brando-ish looks, presence and acting chops. And his sword-fighting <br/>
skills are superb. Watch your back Ken Watanabe - you may not be the <br/>
last samurai after all.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-83378259">I saw the movie last month.<br/>
I thought the 70's version was much better.<br/>
But Kazuki Kitamura and Takeshi Kaga were awesome.<br/>
The lead actor Yosuke Eguchi sucked.<br/>
I will buy DVD anyway.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
This movie "Semi Shigure" looks good.<br/>

If you liked "Tasogare Seibei", you will like this movie too.</div>

 </span></blockquote>You DID read the article, right? It says directly in<br/>
there that it's based on the movie you have (also<br/>
titled GI Samurai in the US). It's fairly obvious if<br/>
you read the article that they are talking about a new<br/>
movie.<br/>
<br/>
For the record, it came out 1 June, and I saw it on 7<br/>
June. It's darn good--not going to win any Oscars, but<br/>
much better than the cheesiness of the 1970's version. <br/>
