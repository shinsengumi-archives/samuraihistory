I'm new to this group and to Samurai history in general and have <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1083913937">Hi.<br/>
 Any of Stephen Turnbulls books are a good place to start;<br/>
 Try "Samurai armies", "The Samurai Sourcebook", and "The Samurai- a military <br/>
history" and others for some of the best basic information on the Samurai out <br/>
at the moment.<br/>
 From there I would suggest "The tales of the Heike" (Translated) By Helen <br/>
McCullough (Or Heike Monogatari) for a history of the events leading up to <br/>
the first Shogunate in Japan under the Minamoto family in 1190a.d.<br/>
 Other good reads are "The Bakufu" by J. Maas, "Hired Swords" By Dr. Karl F. <br/>
Friday, and "Legacies of the sword" also by Dr. Friday.<br/>
 Amazon.com should have all of these books, or other online bookstores will <br/>
but I would start with Stephen Turnbulls books as they are concise, easy to <br/>
read and well illustrated with photos and drawings. A good start.<br/>
 Good luck.<br/>
 Abayo.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1754716320">Thanx Ben,<br/>
<br/>
I think I'll start with Turbull's books more related to the warfare <br/>
aspect. I've found some very nice sites on the subject but Samurai <br/>
Archives is "the cream of the crop". Very nicely done and a great <br/>
introduction on this period.<br/>
<br/>
Any info on the use of christian Samurai by the Portuguese?<br/>
<br/>
Cheers,<br/>
<br/>

is needed to forfill thier duty to thier Dyimo (sorry<br/>
I don't remember the correct spelling). Although mabye<br/>
if one was a ronin then they might, and the contry at<br/>
war period wasn't the best time to live thier. <br/>
<br/>
Who knows, mabye I shouldn't be speaking on this<br/>
subject.<br/>
<br/>
On the book subject I have read Book of Five Rings,<br/>
and most of Art of War. Though I may have to re read<br/>
both to better understand them.<br/>

If your interested in this period of japanese history,<br/>
one of the best books you can read is probably<br/>
"Bushido" It basically details the samurais way of<br/>
life back then.<br/>
<br/>
As for the samurai mercenaries, the answer is I think<br/>
so. I don't know for sure, but there are definatley<br/>
hints that the Inquisition used christian samurai. I<br/>
don'r think they used them alongside there<br/>
conquistadores though.<br/>
<br/>
This was a very controversial subject back then. For a<br/>
samurai to be controlled by a "gaijin" a foreigner,<br/>
sent alot of samurai up in flames. The Gaijin were<br/>
below the "eta" in japanese society, this meant that<br/>
anyone who came from outside of japan was SUB-human,<br/>
and to be treated as such.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>   There were Japanese overseas in the sixteenth century, and I did <br/>
see references to Japanese in Macao (or maybe Goa) when I was writing <br/>
my masters thesis, but I didn't keep the reference (I was looking at <br/>
Japanese trade and piracy at the time). <br/>
   The shortish answer -- there were Japanese warriors overseas during <br/>
the sixteenth and early seventeenth century, who gradually died off or <br/>
intermarried with the locals after the Tokugawa Shogunate enacted <br/>
their Ban on overseas travel. They were active in the Phillipines and <br/>
siam for sure, often as mercenaries. Whether they were Christian I'd <br/>
have to re-research, but some of them WERE Christians who left when <br/>
Christianity was forbidden by the Tokugawa. My favorite Christian <br/>
daimyo, Konishi Yukinaga (one of the 3 lead generals in Hideyoshi's <br/>
invasion of Korea) picked the wrong side at the battle of Sekigahara <br/>
in 1600 (he fought against the Tokugawa) and was killed.<br/>
   I can look through my notes if you want more details.<br/>
