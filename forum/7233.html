Roningai (1990)<br/>
<br/>
AKA: Street of the Ronin; Street of the Masterless Samurai<br/>
<br/>
Premise: A restaurant outside of Edo in the early 19th century is a <br/>
hangout for whores, lechers and unemployed samurai known as ronin. A <br/>
group of dissatisfied samurai begin murdering prostitutes and even <br/>
the restaurant's owner. When a prostitute named Oshin tries to fight <br/>
back and is captured, three swordsmen come to her defense. <br/>
<br/>
Review: The Japanese are true masters of cinema and Roningai is <br/>
proof positive. Director Kazuo Kuroki paints a rich and detailed <br/>
tapestry of flawed characters and brutal violence nearing the end of <br/>
the age of samurai that carefully builds up to an eruption of <br/>
intense swordplay in the final act. <br/>
<br/>
It is a period on Japanese history marked by transition from the <br/>
feudal era where samurai were near the top of the social ladder to <br/>
an era of relative stability leading into the Meiji Restoration. <br/>
Roningai follows the pitiful lives of a number of people who <br/>
converge on a restaurant just outside of Edo and must contend with <br/>
murderous samurai. Aramaki Gennai, a wild ronin reminiscent of <br/>
Toshiro Mifune's Kikuchiyo from Seven Samurai arrives to resume a <br/>
bawdy relationship with a high-priced prostitute named Oshin. She's <br/>
also the object of desire for a more reserved ronin named Horo <br/>
Gombei. A third warrior known as "Bull" has become the self <br/>
proclaimed protector of Oshin and all of the prostitutes who <br/>
frequent the eatery. Another frustrated warrior named Doi lives with <br/>
his sister and has become a breeder of smelly birds. Trouble begins <br/>
as one by one; the prostitutes begin to turn up dead. Growing fear <br/>
and uncertainty reaches a fever pitch when the restaurant's owner is <br/>
also killed. The killers themselves, a group of samurai and their <br/>
retainers crash the funeral and declare both their distaste for the <br/>
world's oldest profession and their intention to kill any more who <br/>
continue the practice. Incensed, Oshin and Doi's sister plot their <br/>
revenge by setting a trap in order to shoot the first samurai who <br/>
attacks with a pistol. Bull, who has sold himself to the samurai <br/>
foils the attempt and the two girls are captured. After <br/>
incriminating evidence of the samurais' illicit activities come into <br/>
the hands of Doi, his sister is released and Oshin comes in danger <br/>
of being torn apart by real bulls unless the ronin turn up with the <br/>
evidence. Still in a drunken stupor, Gennai shows up first to <br/>
challenge over 100 men single-handedly. Learning of Oshin's plight, <br/>
Gombei then plows into the fray. Finally, Doi in full armor rides in <br/>
on horseback and the three warriors fight furiously to save Oshin. <br/>
<br/>
Kazuo apparently chose filmmaking over a career in the ministry <br/>
after becoming inspired by the films of Akira Kurosawa. This film <br/>
clearly displays those influences and perhaps most noticeable are <br/>
the details. Everything from the sets and costumes to the story <br/>
structure and camera work is meticulously recreated and used. Also <br/>
like Kurosawa's films, the characters are dark and tragic. One <br/>
difference is that instead of watching them descend into darkness, <br/>
they begin there and rise out to become noble. It's hard to describe <br/>
just how well this is done. Initially, Oshin is frivolous and Gennai <br/>
is a drunkard seemingly uncaring about the murders or anything else. <br/>
Gombei is cowardly in his secret affections for Oshin and later <br/>
endures humiliation as a result. Bull is both a coward and an <br/>
opportunist who sells himself to the samurai. Even Doi, who has <br/>
actually managed to earn a living, browbeats his supportive sister <br/>
while dreaming of being a samurai again. All of these characters are <br/>
fairly unlikable. But as they become challenged by the murderous <br/>
samurai, they all eventually rise to the challenge and prove to be <br/>
better than the samurai who scorn them. <br/>
<br/>
As a chambara film, the swordplay action is fairly sparse until the <br/>
final scene, but it more than makes up for it. Holding back on the <br/>
action actually has the positive effect of making the finale fight <br/>
seem all the more startling. You've almost come to expect nothing <br/>
from these swordsmen and when they leap into action, the result is <br/>
incredible. The actor who plays Gennai gives a wonderfully <br/>
expressive physical performance as he stumbles around flinging <br/>
bloodied swords about. His hair which is out of control reminded me <br/>
of Max Mok in The Assassin and although that is no compliment, his <br/>
frenzied role is definitely a highlight. <br/>
<br/>
Roningai is a terrific chambara film and also a fine example of how <br/>
character and depth need not be sacrificed for action and <br/>
excitement. With excellent production values, acting and a simmering <br/>
plot topped off with an incredible finale, you are strongly advised <br/>
to seek this film out.<br/>
