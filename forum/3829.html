<div id="ygrps-yiv-674594414">I have been turning something over in my mind this last few bedridden <br/>
days and it's in reguards to the wearing of the Daisho. Now i know <br/>
that one was not to wear both into a house or in the presence of a <br/>
superior, and they would often be kept on a rack togather.<br/>
<br/>
Yet in my recent viewings of non historical mediums,televison, movies<br/>
(many post Kurasawa era films), and even some computer and console <br/>
games. it is often seen that the Samurai is moving about in daily <br/>
life with his katana only. (yes i am aware that the fittings or even <br/>
the entire sword would be diffrent favoring the longer curved blade <br/>
of the tachi.) Just wondering if anyone else had noticed this and if <br/>
it had any real historical backing or just the prop people not <br/>
knowing how to do the knots.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-304498567">In the Edo period the rule was to wear both swords. Don't know if<br/>
Samurai that has sold their short sword was allowed to walk without<br/>
Wakizashi.<br/>
I know that wood replicas of both sheath and blade actually exists. <br/>
Being the Edo jidai life of almost all people strictly ruled by laws<br/>
covering even the little details, I think that even this was in some<br/>
manner codified, but can't say anything for sure.<br/>
