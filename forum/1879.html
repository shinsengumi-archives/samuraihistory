<h3>Proper Care of Japanese Swords</h3>

<br/>
They will have been asked in Japan to show that the<br/>
sword was not an imprortant balde they were removing<br/>
from Japan, also in Japan all sharp swords require a<br/>
license the same way firearms require them.<br/>
<br/>
If the blade is blunt then it is called an Iaito, I am<br/>
asumming then that the blade will me made of an allow.<br/>
If this is so you will not need to oild th blae etc. <br/>
<br/>
Just dust it and care for it as a very nice ornamaent.<br/>
<br/>
If the blade is made from steel then you will require<br/>
a cleaning kit. If that is the case let us know and we<br/>
will provide links where to get one from.<br/>

<br/>
Got a question: in 1603 Tokugawa Ieyasu was appointed as Shogun, and in 1616 he fougth against the last remains of the Toyotomi; was this the year when all the Daimyo submitted to his authority?, if not when this occured?<br/>

	You are very lucky to have such a friend. Anyone who would go <br/>
to such trouble should be cherished. You need aks him if it is a <br/>
"shinsakuto"or a "Iaito" (mogito). If it is an Iaito then you need <br/>
only keep it clean, if it is a shinsakuto you'll need a cleaning kit.<br/>
	For a traditionally made Japanese sword a cleaning kit is <br/>
tissue or better yet rice paper, a ball of uchiko and choji oil. <br/>
Uchiko is a mild abrasive used to clean off the old coating of oil <br/>
before an application of a new one. the Choji oil is usually a <br/>
mineral oil with a hint of choji (clove) for fragrance, this is most <br/>
assuredly NOT the same oil used for toothache so be careful. There is <br/>
also Tsubaki abura, or camellia oil which some prefer because it has <br/>
little or no odor. Uchiko is made from the "sludge" or by product of <br/>
the uchigomori stone used in polishing. Literally "child of the <br/>
Uchigomori". There are several grades but for Shinsakuto it matters <br/>
little.<br/>
	If your saya is new, remember that it was likely not made for <br/>
your climate but that of Japan. If the fit of the habaki or collar on <br/>
your sword/saya is tight do not force it but leave a 1/4 inch of it <br/>
out of the saya. It is expected that in a new saya the opening will <br/>
be very tight, in a dryer climate it may contract and crack. There is <br/>
little maintence for a well made saya...<br/>

<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-773399471">Hi Bud, <br/>
<br/>
     First off, is there any reason that you would need a sharp <br/>
sword? Unless you are training, or will be training in a style of <br/>
Japanese swordsmanship that performs tameshigiri(test cutting),it <br/>
would be a big expense for no practical reason. This should be done <br/>
by a professional sword polisher to be done properly (to preserve the <br/>
integrity and value of the blade), and that is costly.    <br/>
     If you are or will be taking up such training, your instructor <br/>
is who you should talk to. If he is not comfortable with his <br/>
knowledge of assessing swords they should know someone that can help. <br/>
Many a good blade has been ruined or destroyed by the untrained or <br/>
the inexperienced in attempts at sharpening.  <br/>
  Second, even if this sword is suitible for sharpening and you see a <br/>
need for a sharp sword, you may want to to leave it dull while you <br/>
learn the basics of handling it properly. People have lost fingers <br/>
just drawing a sword out improperly.<br/>
   On mataining the sword, if it if steel, there is a good article on <br/>
the JSSUS (Japanese Sword Society of the US) website--here is their <br/>
link: <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.jssus.org/.">http://www.jssus.org/.</a><br/>
<br/>
Good Luck, and whatever you do, be safe!<br/>

<h3>Re: Proper Care of Japanese Swords</h3>
by <i>cebrann</i>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-204880375">Thank you Tom. I appreciate your comments.<br/>
<br/>
Yes I am honored and privileged to have a friend such as Yasuhiro, <br/>
(Ken) Komatsu. I have known Komatsu-San for 20 years, first as <br/>
business associates then as friends. Ken was employed by a company <br/>
which was the Japanese distributor for my company's products.<br/>
<br/>
Ken was the best English speaker with his company and as such was <br/>
sent to the U.S. for 6 months to learn better English and our company <br/>
products. As Manager Far East I spent much time with him. My company <br/>
also spent $ 7000 on Japanese language lessons for me, so we could <br/>
converse pretty well.<br/>
<br/>
I have been greatly honored by being invited several times to visit <br/>
his home, not common in Japan where most entertaining is done <br/>
elsewhere, and he has visited mine. I became well acquainted with his <br/>
family; his father, wife and two children.<br/>
<br/>
 I took early retirement in 1992 and a few years later Komatsu-San <br/>
changed companies. I very much regret that I have not been able to <br/>
visit Japan since I retired, but Komatsu-San has been to the U.S. <br/>
twice and each time has visited me, at some effort since I live in an <br/>
out of the way community now. We correspond by e-mail.<br/>
<br/>
Although during my career, I have been so lucky as to be able to <br/>
visit, often numerous times, some 40 countries in Europe, the Middle <br/>
East, Central and South America, and Asia as well as Australia, I <br/>
grew to love Japan and the Japanese people most. I have never met any <br/>
people who work so hard, and play equally hard, who are so worldly <br/>
wise, yet cherish their gardens, temples, and Cherry blossums. Had I <br/>
not had a business reversal losing a lot of money, I had planned to <br/>
try and live in Japan for a year or two.<br/>
<br/>
While I can never repay Ken's wonderful gift to me, he sort of thinks <br/>
I have. He is a great fan of Glen Cambell and Andy Williams. During <br/>
one of his visits I took him to see Andy Williams in Branson and he <br/>
told me that was the best Christmas present I could ever give him. <br/>
Last fall, he brought his Wife to the U.S. for the first time and I <br/>
took them both to see Andy Williams and Glen Cambell. <br/>
<br/>
What amazed both him and me was how his wife, who speaks virtually no <br/>
English, could disappear, going to the ladies room for what seemed <br/>
like ages, and when we would go looking for her we found that, <br/>
through the language barrier, she was conversing with an American <br/>
woman and within 15 minutes they knew all about each others children <br/>
and lives.<br/>
Perhaps its through such simple things that world understanding and <br/>
peace will someday be achieved.<br/>
