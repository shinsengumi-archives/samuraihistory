<h3>OT: Spam letter</h3>
by <i>holydemon13</i>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1574253680">Hi.<br/>
       Earlier tonight, I found out -- through my own admitted stupidity -- <br/>
that my password to America Online had been stolen and an email sent out to <br/>
over nine hundred recipients.  If anyone received a letter from my email address <br/>
between about 21:25 and 22:00 (9.25 and 10pm) EST tonight, it did NOT come <br/>
from me.  I apologise to anyone this may have happened to.  My password has been <br/>
successfully changed, so that the one that was stolen will not work.  Again, <br/>
my apologies.<br/>
<br/>
