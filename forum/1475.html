<h3>Samurai Lifestlye</h3>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-719490015">Hmm.  I must admit the way you at least worded your message did raise <br/>
many thoughts and ideas.  It certainly is an umm.. interesting <br/>
comcept you have there.  Far be it from me though to tell you how to <br/>
live your life.  However, I think the book LIVING THE MARTIAL WAY: A <br/>
MANUAL FOR THE WAY A MODERN WARRIOR SHOULD THINK by Forrest Morgan <br/>
(intended for martial artists, but aspects can be adapted by non-<br/>
martial artists) will be able to help you in fuguring out how to <br/>
think and act like a warrior in the modern times.  Remember do not <br/>
follow things you read blindly because a book says that it was how <br/>
the samurai acted.  In my personal opinion you should be more <br/>
concrened about living a life of honor rather then a samurai since it <br/>
would be (to say the least) nearly impossible unless you were to find <br/>
some unusual people in this world.  Read on samurai philosophy, and <br/>
then use your own mind to figure out what it means.  As was suggested <br/>
you might also want to read on Confucianism and Buddhism.  For <br/>
Buddhism, look into mainly the Zen, Tendai, and Shingon schools <br/>
because they had the biggest impact on the samurai.  And look into <br/>
Neo-Confucianism since it evetually took the place of original <br/>
Confucianism in East Asia.</div>
