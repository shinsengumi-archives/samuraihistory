<div id="ygrps-yiv-1427319062">Hi. Do any of you know about a film  about a Japanese soldier from WW2 & the ghostly  beings that would appear to him after the war was over for him. If you do know could you post the name of the film? I would also appreciate if you could tell me where I can order a copy. THANKS Walter O'Keefe<br/>
