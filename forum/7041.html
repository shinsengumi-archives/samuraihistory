Regarding your dog, it is not the size that matters, it is the fact that you will have to put your pet in quarantine for some time (at your expense)> Imagine the trauma. If there is any way you can leave your dog with your parents or siblings or friend, anything would be better. He won't pick up the language in a year anyway.<br/>

I've brought over two dogs from the US. The laws here<br/>
have JUST changed, making things more difficult. Email<br/>
me off list (AS THIS IS EXTREMELY OFF TOPIC, AND AS A<br/>
MODERATOR I'M FORCED TO POINT THIS OUT) and I'll give<br/>
you what info I can. <br/>
