<h3>Samauri cutting off ponytail</h3>
by <i>moosho21</i>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-994923639">Hello everyone,<br/>
      I have a question regarding the practice of a samuari cutting off <br/>
his ponytail. What does it mean? I tried to research it and the only <br/>
thing I could find was that it was a symbol of suicide??????? I am <br/>
watching a Korean drama called Yi Soon-shin. It took place on this <br/>
drama. I know it must have significant meaning... <br/>
Thank you for your time!!!!!!!!</div>

	A number of things are going on when a samurai cuts off his topknot;<br/>
<br/>
First off it is symbolic of a renunciation of secular life, of self.  <br/>
Thus a buddhist shaves his or her head when entering the monastic  <br/>
life. Conversely we see Sumo wrestlers cut off their topknots when  <br/>
ending their (monk-like?) life in the sport and re-entering  <br/>
pedestrian life.<br/>
<br/>
At the coming of age ceremony a young samurai boy has his head shaved  <br/>
and dressed for the first time in the style of an adult. As an adult  <br/>
he accepts all the responsibilities of his house, his life, his body,  <br/>
serve his lord and by extension belong to him. He is expected to  <br/>
avoid any action which would bring disgrace on his lord, so he must  <br/>
always dress and act properly. To fail to answer a challenge, to die  <br/>
in a fight with your sword undrawn, to allow the name or the family- <br/>
crest of ones lord to be besmirched among other crimes, would all  <br/>
bring great shame on your house and your lord.Hairstyle was a clear,  <br/>
visible representation of rank and position.(keep in mind these  <br/>
customs may have had their origins in the age of war, but found their  <br/>
extremes in the Edo period)<br/>
<br/>
	So we can imagine the shock of the villagers in the Seven Samurai  <br/>
when they see a seemingly sane member of the bushi class shaving his  <br/>
head and removing his swords, to aid a little peasant boy. No wonder  <br/>
a crowd gathers! And Japanese filmgoers all recognize that with his  <br/>
shaved head and the simple sash he is given he has assumed the guise  <br/>
of a priest.<br/>
<br/>
	In the film Seppuku, the hero chooses to cut off the topknots of his  <br/>
enemies rather than their heads, knowing that if they were true  <br/>
samurai they would have no choice but to kill themselves rather than  <br/>
reveal their shame to their lord.<br/>

In the drama I am watching Hideyoshi cut off his topknot after his <br/>
only son died ,infront of his daymios. His dayimos in returned cut <br/>
off their topknots and said it was for his sons soul......  Would <br/>
this be classified under renunciation of self?<br/>

In this drama Toyotomi Hideyoshi is devasted at the death of his <br/>
only son. When his son passes. He goes outside to his dayimos and <br/>
cuts off his ponytail and all the dayimos cut off theirs. They say <br/>
it is for Hideyoshi son's soul. Is this an accurate portrayal of <br/>
what might have happened? It was a very dramatic scene....<br/>

 </span></blockquote>The movie you're watching, "Owl's Castle" (Fukuro no<br/>
shiro), is a completely different case than the ones<br/>
explained. Hideyoshi is insane with grief--emphasis on<br/>
insane. He cuts his topknot off in a fit of grief at<br/>
his son's funeral. The daimyo gathered behind him then<br/>
follow suit--not out of grief at the death, but<br/>
because Hideyoshi did it, so in order to appear loyal,<br/>
they must two. Several of the daimyo comment that<br/>
Hideyoshi has gone mad, including Ishida Mitsunari and<br/>
Tokugawa Ieyasu. In fact, the main reason Ieyasu<br/>
commissions the assasination of Hideyoshi is because<br/>
he believes Hideyoshi's gone insane--this is the whole<br/>
premise of the movie. <br/>
<br/>
Hideyoshi's not renouncing anything--you seem him<br/>
later in the movie, with a perfectly good topknot, as<br/>
you see all the other daimyo. Had he renounced the<br/>
world, he'd have shaved his head, not just cut off his<br/>
topknot. His act is the equivalent of someone today<br/>
taking a baseball bat and smashing a window out of<br/>
rage or anger. Don't read too much into that scene in<br/>
that particular movie. <br/>

<br/>
Yes, they had pony tails during the Heian period. For that matter, long <br/>
hair is generally shown as far back as Shotoku Taishi. However, sons of <br/>
Shotoku Taishi are generally shown wearing looped pig tails. The <br/>
details of shaven forelocks and exact arrangement of the pony tail <br/>
varied a fair amount during the Edo period.</div>
