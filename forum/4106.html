But sometimes Nobunaga is referred to as "the" unifier implying that <br/>

<br/>
So he's "a" unifier in terms of what he accomplished, but he is not <br/>
"the" unifier of Sengoku Japan.<br/>

Does that make sense?<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1553956338">I believe Oda Nobunaga was a great, if (personally) not likeable person. He set himself (through ambition or just sheer consequence), and eventually Japan upon the route to unification. His control was far more effectual than that imposed four centuries earlier by either Taira no Kiyomori or Minamoto no Yoritomo, but like these earlier examples, his control was only over the central island of Honshu, not Kyushu, Shikoku, Chugoku (although that was under way at the time of his death), Tohoku or Hokkaido. Although more significant than Toyotomi Hideyoshi in what he established, it is Hideyoshi who brought the bulk of the archipelago under a central administration and was e facto unifier, although it was Nobunaga or set the work in motion and undertook much of the hard labour (smashing the Ikko ikki, the Enryakuji, the Imagawa, the Takeda, &c) that made the work of Toyotomi and the Tokugawa considerably easier. <br/>

were perfectly suited to.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-154609549">I guess we will never know if Oda Nobunaga would "probably never" have been Shogun. He installed Ashikaga Yoshiaki, brother of the murdered Shogun Ashikaga Yoshiteru, in 1568, only to depose him in the early 1570s. Therefore between then and the victory of Tokugawa Ieyasu there were no Shogun. He was the leading commander in the country, and controller of the Kinai, who year after year was presented with titles from the court, finally reaching daijo daijin in 1578. Yes he never became Shogun, but equally should Ieyasu have become Shogun? (to follow your line of argument). Both were extremely ambitious, often treacherous, characters from equally obscure regional families, and both raised great opposition in and around the Court during their ascendancies. Why, therefore would Nobunaga "probably never" have been Shogun, when Ieyasu established a disciplined, effective Bakufu?<br/>

 </span></blockquote>A question I can not seem to answer for my self is this: was Yoshiaki <br/>
was in fact still the official Shogun until his death in the 1590s <br/>
(1592 I believe off the top of my head)? It's said that 1573 <br/>
represents the end of the Muromachi Bakufu, but I've always noticed <br/>
that Yoshiaki is allowed to stay alive. I have not been able to find <br/>
out for sure but as far as I can tell the Emperor did not rescind the <br/>
office of Shogun. If Yoshiaki still was Shogun even if in name only, <br/>
Nobunaga would have had to have waited until at least the 1590s (and <br/>
of course it's a requirement that Honnoji didn't end up happening). Or <br/>
he would have had to out and out kill Yoshiaki - which I don't think <br/>
would have happened.<br/>
<br/>
Another factor is that Nobunaga had set him self up as being a <br/>
descendant of the Taira family. There is a common opinion that <br/>
there was no way that a Taira was going to be made Shogun instead of s<br/>
omeone of the Minamoto (which is why Hideyoshi wanted to be adopted an<br/>
d why Ieyasu changed his name). This same sentiment would have <br/>
applied to Nobunaga as well.<br/>

  administrative and political skills to consolidate his gains. I'm <br/>
  left to believe that each of the three men - Nobunaga, Hideyoshi, <br/>
  Ieyasu - each played the role in the "unification" process that they <br/>
  were perfectly suited to.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1681936408">Nobunaga was never particularly interested in titles, just power. <br/>
And I don't know what you mean about "should Ieyasu have been <br/>
Shogun...". Also, I don't really have an argument to follow. I was <br/>
just saying Nobunaga was never Shogun, so there's no "disagreeing" <br/>
or "agreeing" about it.<br/>
I feel that Nobunaga would not have become Shogun for similiar <br/>
reasons Hideyoshi could never have been Shogun. We all tend to <br/>
hear "Shogun" and think, aside from the occasional Emperor, that was <br/>
the s**t in Medieval Japan. There were plenty of other ways and <br/>
titles Nobunaga could have had to become the most powerful man in <br/>
Japan... but I don't think he really cared for them. As long as he <br/>
was in charge he could be called whatever they wanted to call him. <br/>
I'm pretty sure I recall that the court didn't so much <br/>
grant "Shogunates" as it was requested of the court, and I doubt <br/>
Nobunaga would have bothered. I'm not saying he couldn't have become <br/>
the leader of Japan, just not the leader using the particular <br/>
title "Shogun".<br/>

murdered Shogun Ashikaga Yoshiteru, in 1568, only to depose him in <br/>
the early 1570s. Therefore between then and the victory of Tokugawa <br/>
Ieyasu there were no Shogun. He was the leading commander in the <br/>
country, and controller of the Kinai, who year after year was <br/>
presented with titles from the court, finally reaching daijo daijin <br/>
in 1578. Yes he never became Shogun, but equally should Ieyasu have <br/>
become Shogun? (to follow your line of argument). Both were <br/>
extremely ambitious, often treacherous, characters from equally <br/>
obscure regional families, and both raised great opposition in and <br/>
around the Court during their ascendancies. Why, therefore would <br/>
Nobunaga "probably never" have been Shogun, when Ieyasu established <br/>
a disciplined, effective Bakufu?<br/>
