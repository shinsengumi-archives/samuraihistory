<div id="ygrps-yiv-686913635">It is interisting to note that famous and well known Bushi(those of <br/>
the warrior class) are shown in times leading up to the Tokugawa <br/>
peace 1605-1867 with Nobunaga, Hidayoshi, Ieyasu and others of the <br/>
Mori, Hojo, ect.<br/>
<br/>
And also those within the Menji Restoration, and times of rebellion <br/>
by the last of the bushi class. Satsuma being the most well known of <br/>
such rebellions. <br/>
<br/>
Yet, with the noteable acception of Musashi, of which i am still <br/>
trying to find historical evidance of his existance, there are very <br/>
few bushi of note during the Tokugawa peace.<br/>
<br/>
personaly I have found that many of the myths and movies, that have <br/>
fed off those myths tend to show much of the life during the Peace, <br/>
being the one on one battles in forests and along roads. <br/>
<br/>
Not to say that popular and interisting bushi didn't arise out of <br/>
such era, it is more that they really had no way to get any sort of <br/>
recognition, due to the overall lack of major battles during the <br/>
Peace.<br/>
