<h3>Re: [samuraihistory] Samurai and Zen</h3>
by <i>thomas_tessera</i>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-689033666">Hi Paula -<br/>
<br/>
If you can get hold of a copy of 'Japanese Swordsmanship' by <br/>
G Warner and D Draeger (Weatherhill) or better still 'Legacies<br/>
of the Sword' by Karl Friday (University of Hawai'i Press)<br/>
there are some interesting notes on this topic, but they might <br/>
upset your ideas about Zen and the samurai!<br/>
<br/>
Zen as we understand it made a relatively late appearance among <br/>
the samurai, emerging during the late sixteenth century, and <br/>
although some noble swordsmen were influenced by Zen, their <br/>
foundation and formation as swordsmen was not Zen, but <br/>
determined by a host of influences.<br/>
<br/>
Earlier infuences can be traced back to the founding of Zen in <br/>
Japan, and Kamakura or 'warrior zen', dating from the 12 <br/>
century, the classical era of the samurai, was a far more <br/>
practical business, it's appeal lay in its existentialism and <br/>
its self-determinism, rather than in any spiritual ideal beyond <br/>
living in the moment. It suited the samurai character which was <br/>
marked by self-justification, self-reliance, pride and vanity, <br/>
and did not bother him with quibbles about morality, or right <br/>
and wrong.<br/>
<br/>
By far the most significant influences upon the samurai and <br/>
swordsmanship in particular was Shinto, Tendai Buddhism and the <br/>
syncretic forms of 'mikkyo' - Shingon or esoteric Buddhism.<br/>
<br/>
A study of 'horimono' - the engravings made on sword blades - <br/>
showed over 95% bore images from Shingon Buddhism - none <br/>
concerned Zen or its concepts.<br/>
<br/>
The direct and founding influences on the development of <br/>
swordsmanship came from:<br/>
<br/>
Taoism - an understanding of natural principle<br/>
<br/>
Confucianism - ethics and morality<br/>
<br/>
Shinto - aesthetic values<br/>
<br/>
And Shingon, which bears elements of the above.<br/>
<br/>
Furthermore the names of the techniques of swordsmanship <br/>
themselves show Buddhist, Confucian, Taoist and Shinto <br/>
influence, and the great schools themselves are founded on <br/>
Shinto Shrines.<br/>
<br/>
In short, one might say there were Zen swordsmen, but <br/>
swordsmmanship itself is the product of Shinto and Taoist <br/>
principles and practice.<br/>
<br/>

I am a member of the JKAA (Japanese Karate Association of Australia) <br/>
and have been practicing Shotokan Karate for about 12 years. Too this <br/>
day I haven't seen any relationship with Bushido nor has there been <br/>
any reference to the Samurai. Now I'm not saying you are wrong, all <br/>
I'm saying is that the Australian branch of the JKA dose not use any <br/>
references to Bushido nor do they have any Samurai influences. Now I <br/>
also practice Ninjutsu, which is very heavily influenced by Bushido <br/>
and the Samurai way. For example, there is a great emphasis on <br/>
intuition training and stealth training. To our original poster, a <br/>
good book to look into would be "code of the Samurai" by  <br/>
Thomas Cleary. One advice I have is to keep in mind that Bushido was <br/>
a way of life for these people.</div>

I am a member of the JKAA (Japanese Karate Association of Australia) <br/>
and have been practicing Shotokan Karate for about 12 years. Too this <br/>
day I haven't seen any relationship with Bushido nor has there been <br/>
any reference to the Samurai. Now I'm not saying you are wrong, all <br/>
I'm saying is that the Australian branch of the JKA dose not use any <br/>
references to Bushido nor do they have any Samurai influences. Now I <br/>
also practice Ninjutsu, which is very heavily influenced by Bushido <br/>
and the Samurai way. For example, there is a great emphasis on <br/>
intuition training and stealth training. To our original poster, a <br/>
good book to look into would be "code of the Samurai" by <br/>
Thomas Cleary. One advice I have is to keep in mind that Bushido was <br/>
a way of life for these people. <br/>

<br/>
'Bushido' has been discussed here at length. As a formalised code it makes a very <br/>
late appearance - I would view it as a code based on how previous generations had <br/>
lived, rather than a particular code on which the samurai modelled his life.<br/>
<br/>
I might go so far as to say that the 'appearance' of the code - as someone writing <br/>
'The Way of the Warrior' or whatever, signifies that way was already slipping into <br/>
history...<br/>
<br/>
Zen, similarly, although around since the 12th century, had a relatively unimportant <br/>
influence on the development of the samurai, and almost none on the development of <br/>
swordsmanship, compared to Shingon, Shinto and Taoism. <br/>
<br/>
Zen as a 'major player' or major influence begins in the Edo period, with traces visible <br/>
in the end of the Sengoku. Whilst one might cite Musashi, or better Yagyu Munenori <br/>
and Kamiizuni Nobutsuna, these men knew of Zen as a training regime, but their <br/>
martial philosophy was founded on Shingon, Shinto and Tao.<br/>
<br/>
Notably Takuan Soho, the Zen master, friend and 'spiritual director' of some notable <br/>
swordsmen, employed elements of mikkyo - esoteric Buddhism - in his teachings.<br/>
<br/>
The appeal of Zen to the warrior is primarily because of its near silence on issues of <br/>
morality and its focus on the 'act' and the 'now' etc. It suited a warrior ethic, especially <br/>
one that for long periods of history would not bear examination in light of the so-called <br/>
'code' it professed to live by.<br/>
<br/>
In short, if bushido was the code, in any real sense, how come the history is so full of <br/>
deceits, deceptions and betrayals?<br/>

If their evidence stands out in contradiction to all the documented sources<br/>

Certainly there is evidence that many bushi practised empty-hand grappling<br/>
as an adjunct art to the weapon styles that were their mainstay - but karate<br/>
(which in its earliest form, as I recall, simply means 'Okinawan hand') is<br/>
very distinct from the aiki-jutsu which we have evidence of bushi<br/>
practising.  Aikido could lay a more direct and more convincing claim to the<br/>
ancestral influence you describe.  Really - study some more; learn some more<br/>
about what you're talking about:  you won't find support for your argument<br/>

you've done here - someone whose manners are rather better than yours, based<br/>

it show respect for your art to insult a fellow practitioner when he<br/>

 </span></blockquote>The Okinawans were not samurai. Until the 17th century<br/>
they were more closely tied to China than Japan.<br/>
Japanese influence came mainly through the Shimazu in<br/>
Satsuma, and I hardly think they "promoted" the<br/>
Okinawans to samurai status when they made it a<br/>
tributary state of theirs. <br/>
<br/>
As for the rest of this, I'm thouroughly confused as<br/>
to who is saying what at this point. When you (not you<br/>
Gereg, but some of the other posters in this thread)<br/>
reply to someone, make sure it's clear where the email<br/>
you are replying to ends and your comments begin. I<br/>
haven't commented for several reasons: a. I can't tell<br/>
who's writing what, even though I approved the<br/>
messages; b. it's yet ANOTHER bushido/zen/martial arts<br/>
discussion, and I've got no interest in it; c. even if<br/>
I did, I'm sure the words of some martial arts sensei<br/>
claiming karate was founded by Miyamoto Musashi and<br/>
Minamoto Yoshitsune working together would weigh more<br/>
heavily with some of our young practioners than my<br/>
pointing out that the two didn't live in the same<br/>
century. <br/>
<br/>
I remember when I was 14, taking Shotokan karate-do as<br/>
has been brought up in previous posts. I respected my<br/>
sensei as an instructor of karate technique, but even<br/>
at age 14 I had more complete knowledge of Japanese<br/>
history and culture. This isn't a dig on teenagers,<br/>
and I don't know if the posters in this thread are or<br/>
are not. It doesn't matter. Whether you are 14 or 40,<br/>
you have to invesitgate and question, even if the info<br/>
comes from your sensei. Shotokan Karate is JAPANESE,<br/>
yes, as opposed to Okinawan. It was developed in Tokyo<br/>
by Gichin Funakoshi. However, it does draw from<br/>
Okinawan karate, and technique wise is closely<br/>
related. Master Funakoshi was alive in the late 19th<br/>
and early 20th centuries. While he may or may not have<br/>
wished to include "Zen" or "Bushido", it was hardly a<br/>
"samurai art". <br/>

Well if you are talking about the Japanese Karate Association then I <br/>
have studied with the Australian branch of this affiliation and I <br/>
don't think that now after so many years of training I would be <br/>
exposed to bushido. It just doesn't work like that. If there was <br/>
Bushido influences then I would have be made aware of this on the <br/>

martial arts sine the age of 5, training in many different styles, <br/>
majority of them being Japanese, However I have studied wing Chun <br/>
briefly. I agree with continues researching as this broadens the mind <br/>
and help you to realise that not everything you read is correct and <br/>
you learn to take some things with a grain of salt. A trait, which I <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-75834777">With all due respect, I HAVE studied JKA Shotokan karate, and I know that Master Funakoshi did not base his study on the samurai. <br/>
His Karate is 'empty hand' technique, developed so because they were not allowed weapons.   Perhaps this link might refresh your <br/>
memory: http://www.ska.org/funakoshi.shtml<br/>
<br/>
That the teachings of Master Funakoshi and a selection of those of bushido seem to have melded is both a somewhat serendipitous and <br/>
also a consciously adopted modern practice.  But it was not planned so by Master Funakoshi, and the samurai class was long disbanded <br/>
before his time.  I would go so far as to propose the thought that karate and the samurai had a common ancestor in the precepts of <br/>
other oriental teachings:  Shinto, Tao, Buddhism, and probably others I'm too tired to bring into mind after a long hard shift at <br/>

My sensei studied with both Masters Funakoshi & Nakayama in Japan. I met Master Nakayama once, and Master Nishayama several times. <br/>
It might do you well to reread their writings and take them to heart as well as practice.  You do them no honor with your behavior <br/>
on this list.  None of these esteemed men advocated anger, rudeness,  or ego.  All three can cloud your mind and affect your <br/>

keep 'beginner's mind' with whatever one pursued, at whatever level of mastery, in whatever area of your life..... because then your <br/>
mind would be prepared to learn, to see things anew, and not blocking off learning.  It is with this spirit that one remains humble, <br/>
peaceful, and receptive to our environment.<br/>

I hope that you receive the feedback you have gotten from me, and the others in the best possible light, and choose to learn from us <br/>

Then perhaps you have not studied true JKA Karate, there is such a<br/>

a longer length of time. Try reading some of the books by Funakoshi,<br/>
Demura and Nakayama. Or you could e-mail the mother association in<br/>

Well if you are talking about the Japanese Karate Association then I<br/>
have studied with the Australian branch of this affiliation and I<br/>
don't think that now after so many years of training I would be<br/>
exposed to bushido. It just doesn't work like that. If there was<br/>
Bushido influences then I would have be made aware of this on the<br/>
very first day or at least after a few weeks. I have been studying<br/>
martial arts sine the age of 5, training in many different styles,<br/>
majority of them being Japanese, However I have studied wing Chun<br/>
briefly. I agree with continues researching as this broadens the mind<br/>
and help you to realise that not everything you read is correct and<br/>
you learn to take some things with a grain of salt. A trait, which I<br/>
believe, you should inherit.<br/>

<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-2000376983">I'd like to turn everyones attention to the fact that I did not say Funakoshi drew an influence from the samurai as it was already there! And had been for centuries before his time, the origins of true Karate are shrouded in mistery therefore who is to say Samurai as well as the techniques of the Shaolin temple have an influence in Karate. I am just saying after e-mailing top masters from JKA honbu, our  own master Ohta and my own research has concluded with very good explanations from Japanese masters that the Samurai had such a big impact!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!<br/>
The following is from the JKA website:<br/>
 Karate is not a game of points, weight classes or showy demonstrations. It is a martial art and way of life that trains a practitioner to be peaceful; but if conflict is unavoidable, true karate dictates taking down an opponent with a single blow. <br/>
<br/>
Such an action requires strength, speed, focus, control. But these physical aspects are only part of the practice; they are just the vehicle, not the journey itself.<br/>
<br/>
True karate is based on Bushido. In true karate, the body, mind and<br/>
spiritthe whole personmust be developed simultaneously. Through kihon, kumite and kata we learn to control our movements. But more im-<br/>
portantly, we learn to give up con-<br/>
trol too. We can perform the tech-<br/>
niques without thinking about them, and remain focused without having<br/>
to concentrate on any one thing. In essence, the body remembers how<br/>
to move and the mind remembers<br/>
how to be still.<br/>
<br/>
This harmonious unity of mind and body is intensely powerful. Even the greatest physical strength and skill are no match for the power of wholeness.<br/>
<br/>
The result of true karate is natural, effortless action, and the confidence, humility, openness and peace only possible through perfect unity of mind and body. This is the core teaching of Zen, the basis of Bushido, and the  of the JKAs karate philosophy.<br/>

<br/>
Zev, I'd turn that suggestion back on you and "strongly suggest" that you<br/>
yourself do quite a bit more research into the samurai and martial arts,<br/>
before you take so condescending a tone - especially with someone like that<br/>
polite Australian, who's gone to such trouble to avoid insulting another<br/>
party on the list. The available histories of the samurai class - and there<br/>
are a number of them available, if you're willing to take the trouble to<br/>
read them - do not readily support your view. In fact, as Paul pointed out,<br/>
the best indications are that the only link between the Okinawans (who<br/>
originated karate) and the Japanese bushi (or samurai)... were that they<br/>
fought against each other.<br/>
Dojo traditions are frequently not very good history, and this one you've<br/>
cited sounds like a classic of the type. To be sure, modern karate stylists<br/>
may have chosen to be influenced by classical samurai traditions of bushido,<br/>
but that does not mean that these traditions had anything to do with the<br/>
early development of the art of karate itself. I don't doubt that your<br/>
senseis are telling you the truth as they believe it: but as I say, dojo<br/>
traditions are not very reliable as history. Where did your teachers get<br/>
this information? How far back does it really go? And can they prove it?<br/>
If their evidence stands out in contradiction to all the documented sources<br/>
from history, then I'd have to say they're only carrying on what they were<br/>
told themselves. That doesn't make it history.<br/>
Certainly there is evidence that many bushi practised empty-hand grappling<br/>
as an adjunct art to the weapon styles that were their mainstay - but karate<br/>
(which in its earliest form, as I recall, simply means 'Okinawan hand') is<br/>
very distinct from the aiki-jutsu which we have evidence of bushi<br/>
practising. Aikido could lay a more direct and more convincing claim to the<br/>
ancestral influence you describe. Really - study some more; learn some more<br/>
about what you're talking about: you won't find support for your argument<br/>
in reputable history. And you will be less likely to insult someone the way<br/>
you've done here - someone whose manners are rather better than yours, based<br/>
on the evidence at hand. Is rudeness part of your dojo tradition too? Does<br/>
it show respect for your art to insult a fellow practitioner when he<br/>
disagrees politely with you? Because that is clearly what you have done.<br/>
And that is not the Way.<br/>
<br/>
And to the fellow who said that "The Okinawans... were samurai," I'm pretty<br/>
sure that claim can't be backed up with reliable history either. (Tony?<br/>
Nate? Any comments on this?) As you noted, the Okinawans did regard<br/>
themselves as a separate nation: so to claim that they were samurai is a<br/>
direct contradiction of that idea, since the samurai were a distinctly<br/>
Japanese phenomenon. This is like saying that the Shaolin monks were<br/>
samurai. I agree that you should never take the martial arts at face value<br/>
(I've got thirty-odd years of practise and study behind me at this stage).<br/>
But that includes the oral traditions that are passed down: you can't take<br/>
those at face value either. At least, not if you hope to have any real<br/>
grasp of history.<br/>

From: "\" " <br/>
Subject: Re: Re: Samurai and Zen<br/>
<br/>
I have posted elsewhere - so just a quick note.<br/>
<br/>
'Bushido' has been discussed here at length. As a formalised code it makes a<br/>
very<br/>
late appearance - I would view it as a code based on how previous<br/>
generations had<br/>
lived, rather than a particular code on which the samurai modelled his life.<br/>
<br/>
I might go so far as to say that the 'appearance' of the code - as someone<br/>
writing<br/>
'The Way of the Warrior' or whatever, signifies that way was already<br/>
slipping into<br/>
history...<br/>
<br/>
Zen, similarly, although around since the 12th century, had a relatively<br/>
unimportant<br/>
influence on the development of the samurai, and almost none on the<br/>
development of<br/>
swordsmanship, compared to Shingon, Shinto and Taoism.<br/>
<br/>
Zen as a 'major player' or major influence begins in the Edo period, with<br/>
traces visible<br/>
in the end of the Sengoku. Whilst one might cite Musashi, or better Yagyu<br/>
Munenori<br/>
and Kamiizuni Nobutsuna, these men knew of Zen as a training regime, but<br/>
their<br/>
martial philosophy was founded on Shingon, Shinto and Tao.<br/>
<br/>
Notably Takuan Soho, the Zen master, friend and 'spiritual director' of some<br/>
notable<br/>
swordsmen, employed elements of mikkyo - esoteric Buddhism - in his<br/>
teachings.<br/>
<br/>
The appeal of Zen to the warrior is primarily because of its near silence on<br/>
issues of<br/>
morality and its focus on the 'act' and the 'now' etc. It suited a warrior<br/>
ethic, especially<br/>
one that for long periods of history would not bear examination in light of<br/>
the so-called<br/>
'code' it professed to live by.<br/>
<br/>
In short, if bushido was the code, in any real sense, how come the history<br/>
is so full of<br/>
deceits, deceptions and betrayals?<br/>

It's stupid, it's wrong, and it's counterproductive. PEople who top-post tend to <br/>

of unnecessary information being promulgated. And, if you happen to get the <br/>

Yes, I can see why you'd want to keep a conversational flow going, by bottom posting.  God, that sounds naughty.<br/>

Top posting is evil. It totally destroys the flow of any conversation, and is<br/>
one of the great evils of the net.<br/>

to, and either reply point by point in the text (like<br/>
I am now), or bottom post. That way, the message looks<br/>
like:<br/>

<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> > What sayeth the ListGods? How shall we do obeisance<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Since the Head List God seems to be on sabbatical,<br/>
this minor demi-god has given his viewpoint. Honestly,<br/>
I don't care--as long as people make things clear.<br/>
PLEASE, when you reply to someone else's post, a.<br/>
delete what's superfluous to your reply, but b. leave<br/>
SOMETHING to let us know to whom you are replying.<br/>
While it's a pain to sift through 4 emails stuck<br/>
together to figure out who's posted last/first, it's<br/>
equally frustrating to get an email that simply says<br/>
<br/>
"Hey, thanks!" with no reference to who they are<br/>
thanking or the reason for the thanks. <br/>
<br/>
I will say I do agree with Tony, it makes more sense<br/>
to either bottom post or respond point by point, but<br/>
will refrain from enforcing any standard unless things<br/>
just get simply ridiculous. <br/>

doohickies off to the left? That's because I'm using Netscape. Other software <br/>
does other things. I don't know what you're using, but I notice that it doesn't <br/>
wrap your messages, either. I have to do that. Fortunately, again, good software <br/>
has a "rewrap" feature to automatically take care of that. :)<br/>

have it set to reply in the format the mail is received, and I like messing with pretty fonts to my friends. Friggin' mail program <br/>
