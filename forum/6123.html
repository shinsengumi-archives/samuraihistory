Japan's PM backs option of empress<br/>
By Deborah Cameron<br/>
December 4, 2004<br/>
  <br/>
Tokyo: Japan is ready for a female emperor and is moving closer to <br/>
changing the law passed in 1947 that reserved the Chrysanthemum <br/>
Throne for men only, according to Japan's Prime Minister, Junichiro <br/>
Koizumi.<br/>
<br/>
"Reigning empresses existed in Japan in the past," he said. "I think <br/>
the public will welcome an empress in the present day. I don't think <br/>
there will be many problems." With his comments, the Prime Minister <br/>
was buying into Japan's hottest topic: the problem that there are no <br/>
males to succeed the current heir, 43-year-old Crown Prince Naruhito.<br/>
<br/>
Emperor Akihito is 71 and in 2002 had surgery for prostate cancer, <br/>
although he appears to have made a full recovery.<br/>
<br/>
But concerns about succession in the world's oldest hereditary <br/>
dynasty have lead to reports this week in the Asahi Shimbun <br/>
newspaper of a government "feasibility study" on the idea of a <br/>
female heir.<br/>
<br/>
Only if there is a change can the throne one day be occupied by <br/>
Princess Aiko, the only child of the Crown Prince and his 41-year-<br/>
old wife, Princess Masako.<br/>
<br/>
Crown Prince Naruhito's younger brother, Akishino, also has no sons, <br/>
and a male from another branch of the ruling family would inherit <br/>
the throne.<br/>
