First of all, there were no such things as "nations," at least until <br/>
the 18th, 19th century; second, national identities were then created <br/>
according to issues such as language, beliefs, eventually race and <br/>
tradition. All things that the Japanese shared. Actually few places in <br/>
the world were (and are) as homogeneous as Japan.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Wait a minute, wait a minute... Do you have an idea of what the <br/>
Holocaust was? Hitler killed 5.7 million people simply because they <br/>
belonged to a race, or because he considered them inferiors. They were <br/>
not people on his path, he sent out over half of Europe his Gestapo and <br/>
special extermination squads to get them, and to murder them. Hitler's <br/>
"final solution," the ultimate decision of killing ALL Jewish, is <br/>
something you can not compare with Nobunaga's will to unify Japan at <br/>
all costs. Nobunaga did not build concentration camps where thousands <br/>
of people were killed every day after they were exploited as slaves.<br/>
And besides that, Nobunaga was born in the middle of a civil war, while <br/>
Hitler started a World War... How can you compare them? Hitler lived <br/>
400 years later than Nobunaga, in a different continent, and in a <br/>
totally different contest.<br/>
Sure, you can speculate that, given the chance, Nobunaga would have <br/>
done as bad as Hitler, but... ***speculate*** that's it.<br/>
History is a different matter. IMHO.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-335489452">Hey.<br/>
       Cepo, I completely agree with you.  History is quite a different <br/>
matter from speculation.  Speculating, though, is still fun to do, and as a(n <br/>
unpublished) fiction writer, I do it ALL the time with various situations that I <br/>
write about.  Pertaining to history, I used to do it all the time with the end <br/>
of the Tsars when I was a more concentrated student of Russian history, and my <br/>
query to Tony some time ago about the alt-history novel about Nobunaga's <br/>
sister, O-ichi.  But in order to speculate, it helps to know the history anyway.  <br/>
:-)  And history is, IMHO, a fascinating subject anyway.  :-)<br/>
