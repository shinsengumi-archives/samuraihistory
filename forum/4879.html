<h3>Musashi - translations, traditions and bunbu-ichi</h3>
by <i>geregjonesmuller</i>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-935336340">Someone recently mentioned "bad Cleary translations," and it's got me to<br/>
wondering about something.  I've got three translations of _Book of Five<br/>
Rings_ on my shelves, as the Harris translation I found in the '70s only<br/>
whetted my appetite for a better understanding.  (I come from a family of<br/>
linguists, and I always prefer to compare translations on any work that<br/>
really matters to me - _Beowulf_, the _Tao Te Ching_, the _Mabinogi_, and<br/>
Musashi, for instance - in order to penetrate a little further into a given<br/>
source work than one translator can ever achieve.)  If I were ever to study<br/>
Japanese, it would mostly be so I could read Musashi in the original.<br/>
Now Cleary's been translating some works I value - Soho's _Unfettered Mind_,<br/>
the Yagyu _Heiho Kaden Sho_ (although he leaves out the incredibly valuable<br/>
illustrations, which is... weird), and - of course - _Five Rings_.  So I'd<br/>
be very grateful if anyone could let me know if there's a problem with his<br/>
translations that I ought to know about.  This one seems to me to be quite a<br/>
bit like Harris's, a little clearer on some points and a little less so on<br/>
others.<br/>
I'd also be grateful if anyone can tell me of a literal,<br/>
character-by-character translation of Musashi's work.  The one I have of the<br/>
_Tao Te Ching_ in that style is by far the most illuminating I've seen, as<br/>
it makes sense of all the variations one finds in the other translations.<br/>
(One English word beneath this character, seven words beneath the next - it<br/>
captures the nuances in a way that makes a good deal of sense, and helps me<br/>
to understand the logic patterns in the parent language.)<br/>
For that matter, are there any books available of his artwork?  I suspect<br/>
that Inagaki uses one of his statues in the opening credits of "Duel at<br/>
Ganryu Island," but I'm not sure.  And the pictures in Harris's translation,<br/>
of course, are only black-and-white.  If he had a serious body of artwork,<br/>
I'd be very interested to get a closer look at it.<br/>
<br/>
Now Harris gives a capsule biography of Musashi which is (I believe) about<br/>
all we really know about him.  Yet Yoshikawa's melodrama of his life (and<br/>
the Inagaki film adaptation), expand on that to so vast a degree that I<br/>
wonder to what extent they represent the novelist's fancy, and to what<br/>
extent they represent legitimate folk tradition.  For example, I understand<br/>
that the tale of his meeting with the jo stylist - whose name escapes me at<br/>
the moment - is actual tradition:  but is it history?  And am I even correct<br/>
in my understanding that it's actual tradition?<br/>
This list is the first place I've come across a group of people sufficiently<br/>
informed that I thought I might find some answers I could trust on the<br/>
subject.  Thank you all for your attention.<br/>

<br/>
 So I'd<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Personal preference, possibly. He's got an agenda, as<br/>
does everyone. His Sun Zi Ping Fa ("Art of War") is<br/>
HORRIBLE, in my opinion. He attempts to take out all<br/>
sense that it's a military strategy guide, and make it<br/>
into some pithy philosophical gobbledygook. Yes, it<br/>
reflects the taoist and confucian philosophy of the<br/>
time Sun Zi wrote, but it's a book of strategy on how<br/>
to defeat an enemy, not a morality play. His<br/>
translation really turned me off--his actual<br/>
translations may be okay (the word for word<br/>
translation), but when he "explains" the text, it<br/>
comes out as philosphical hogwash. <br/>
<br/>
Haven't gone through his "Japanese Art of War", etc.,<br/>
because after reading his Sun Zi I'm simply not<br/>
interested. It seems he's less concerned with any art<br/>
of war, more concerned with contemplating his navel<br/>
and becoming one with the Tao. I've got no problem<br/>
with philosophers, but I do have a problem with<br/>
overinjecting philosophy where it isn't. <br/>
<br/>
 The one I have of the<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Which translation is that? I think I've seen it, and<br/>
you're right, you catch a lot more that way. <br/>
<br/>
I can't help you too much with your Musashi<br/>
questions--I'm not a Musashi officianado at all. But<br/>
someone here will be able to aid, I'm sure. <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1916201208">Like Nate, I'm not exactly a Musashi buff, but just in the spirit of <br/>
having a fun conversation allow me to make some comments.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> >I've got three translations of _Book of Five<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I only have two; the Clearly one (which I just now see that I have <br/>
two copies on my bookshelf. How could that be?); and one from the <br/>
original Japanese into modern Japanese; translated by Kamiko Tadashi <br/>

<br/>
I have to say that I think it would be very painful to try and render <br/>
these writings into English that maintains the same style and nuance. <br/>
I guess that's the job of a person who takes it upon themselves to <br/>
translate literature - but it must be a hell of a task. Personally I <br/>
don't think I've ever found (not that I was looking) any errors in <br/>
Cleary - but it just doesn't quite have the same oomph as the <br/>
original.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> > I'd also be grateful if anyone can tell me of a literal,<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I know what kind of thing you are referring to here, but I don't <br/>
think it would work for Japanese --> English. I guess that it works <br/>
for Chinese because the grammer structures are apparently quite <br/>
similar. But because of the differences in grammar between Japanese <br/>
and English you really couldn't render a character for character <br/>
literal translation; or rather, I would say that doing so wouldn't <br/>
provide any help to more deeply understanding the original.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> > Now Harris gives a capsule biography of Musashi which is (I <br/>

<blockquote><span title="ireply"> > extent they represent legitimate folk tradition.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>This I think is almost impossible to define with precision. By now <br/>
Yoshikawa's Musashi has itself become part of folk tradition. Again <br/>
I'm no expert, but it's my understanding that Musashi's actual life <br/>
is essentially a mystery - even his birthplace is the source of much <br/>
debate. I am of the impression that even the few events which are <br/>
thought to be 'known' (such as his early duel with Arita) are <br/>
impossible to really prove one way or the other.<br/>
<br/>
In no particular relationshp to anything above, allow me to mention <br/>
that last fall I visited a town called "Miyamoto Musashi-no-Mura" <br/>
which is one of the purported birthplaces of Musashi. This one is in <br/>
Okayama Prefecture and is in my esteemed opinion :) the place with <br/>
the best claim. It was a lot of fun to get off of the train <br/>
at "Miyamoto Musashi Station" and walk around. One highlight of the <br/>
trip for me was visiting the supposed grave of Musashi. One other was <br/>
seeing the Hirao family home; this is the family that Musashi's elder <br/>
sister O-gin was married to. Amazingly, the home is still there and <br/>
the Hirao family still live there. It's little experiences and <br/>
episodes like that, that for whatever reason constantly re-kindle my <br/>
interest in Japanese history.</div>

 </span></blockquote>Not a one to one translation but the International Budo University put <br/>
out an excellent little tract on Musashi and the problems with some of <br/>
the translations about four years ago. An excellent read and resource <br/>
if you can find it.<br/>
<br/>

 </span></blockquote>There were exhibitions of his art and swords and writings.( small <br/>
municipal museums) I have seen the catalogs in old book shops,  but <br/>
never bought one. Being from thirty years or so ago, the photos were <br/>
all black and white(and there weren't many swords).<br/>

 </span></blockquote>	my understanding is that nearly everything we know about him comes <br/>
from the little he reveals in his writing and from the biography <br/>
written well after his death by his students. It has to be considered <br/>
carefully as it would have been written to promote the tradition he <br/>
founded. However I would be very much interested in a translation of <br/>
this, which is the seed of the Yoshikawa work, and we shall have to <br/>
hope some lucky scholar is working on that as we speak...<br/>
