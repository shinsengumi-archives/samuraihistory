<h3>The 47 Ronin and Fujii Matazaemon</h3>
by <i>steven_matsheshu</i>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1824903846">Does anyone know how I can check if Fujii Matazaemon (the Ako <br/>
Asano Family Advisor in Edo) who was there when the whole "47 Ronin" <br/>
thing went down (but was not one of the 47 ronin)  ... is there <br/>
anybody here who would know how to check if he was related to the <br/>
same Fujii family which comes out of Hiroshima/Okayama prefecture ? <br/>
This is the same Fujii family which Fujii Kogen and Fujii Taroemon <br/>
came from. This is also the same Fujii family which the majority of <br/>
Fujii these days come from.<br/>
<br/>
 Fujii Matazaemon's son , Fujii Umon, was executed by the Tokugawa <br/>
Shogunate because of his involvement with the Meiwa Inncident (The <br/>
first real movement by western families to bring the Emporer back <br/>
into power and oust the Tokugawa Shogunate).<br/>
<br/>
    Any info is appreciated.<br/>
<br/>
 Thank you.</div>
