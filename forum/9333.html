<h3>samurai, ninja and myths</h3>
by <i>biz_in_japan</i>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1589764898">Hi all,<br/>
<br/>
I've been a long time lurker and very, very rarely poster ... I've <br/>
enjoyed the knowledgeable discussions and even the not so <br/>
knowledgeable discussions as well, lol.<br/>
<br/>
Anyway, before I start explaining what this post is about, keep in <br/>
mind that I'm at university majoring in Asian Studies and <br/>
Philosophy, with my major interest being anything to do with East <br/>
Asia, and especially Japan.  I'm quite widely read on Japanese <br/>
culture, history and language.  <br/>
<br/>
My university's anime society is holding its second convention in a <br/>
couple of weeks and I'm presenting two lectures/discussions in a <br/>
more serious, educational and factual nature then what is usually <br/>
presented at such events.  One is titled "Shinto, its origins and <br/>
what it means to modern Japan" (being of major importance to my <br/>
potential post-graduate studies/research) and the other is <br/>
titled "Samurai, Ninja and Mythconceptions".  Now the purpose of <br/>
this post is to ask the samurai history community about any good <br/>
resources/links related to the second topic, well anything relating <br/>
to the first is quite welcome too.  I've come across quite a lot of <br/>
info already, the uni library has a very large collection of books <br/>
about Japan, in fact too much, because I can't possibly look at it <br/>
all before the con Â… I'm also doing a summer school unit which takes <br/>
priority. <br/>
<br/>
If it's ok with Nate, I would like to quote extensively from <br/>
his "Common Misconceptions Concerning those Kewl Ninja" as well <br/>
as "The Top Eleven Western, Modern Day Common Misconceptions About <br/>
The Samurai", is that yours as well Nate?  Also do you have any <br/>
references for these articles?  <br/>
<br/>
Cheers,<br/>
Warren</div>

 </span></blockquote>Feel free to use the "Common Misconceptions", that's<br/>
all mine. Email me offlist if you'd like as well. As<br/>
for the "Top Eleven Misconceptions", that's not mine;<br/>
I contributed some of the information, but someone<br/>
else put it together. Kitsuno would likely be the best<br/>
person to ask, since I haven't been in contact with<br/>
the author in quite a while. <br/>
