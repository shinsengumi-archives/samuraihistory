<div id="ygrps-yiv-1568129489">I have found a copy from 1951 on half.com for $12.50 and I <br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> > have ordered it straight away. <br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>It's written as fiction but reads as if it is totally authentic; however, as I <br/>
said, I couldn't find out anything about the author so I have no idea <br/>
who he was, where he came from, how long he was in the army.<br/>
<br/>
I'm assuming no one else out there knows, as there have been no other <br/>
posts.<br/>
<br/>
I guess you know 'Japan at War' by Haruko and Theodore Cook. I just <br/>
reread the introduction and was struck again by the description of the <br/>
meeting of the veterans of Changi in Tokyo. There seems to be such a <br/>
silence on what the Japanese actually did, saw and experienced first <br/>
hand in SE Asia - there are many Australian histories and memoirs of <br/>
Burma, Thailand, New Guinea etc, which make agonising reading. It <br/>
always seems to me one of the great tragedies of a tragic war ("the war <br/>
without mercy"):  the Japanese could have liberated Asia from <br/>
colonialism (well, they did effectively), but for most nations the <br/>
liberator was worse than the coloniser, and the lingering results still <br/>
colour foreign policy in the region.<br/>
<br/>
(Just celebrated ANZAC day here in Australia, so there's been a lot of <br/>
media coverage of war)<br/>
