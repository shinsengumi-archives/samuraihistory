<br/>
*snip*Many years ago, I had a koshigatana that had been made in 1368. The<br/>
mei read<br/>
"Bishu Osafune Munemitsu saku." It was short, very slim (essentially, a<br/>
katana<br/>
at about 69% scale), with a really deep curve. I loved that sword.<br/>
<br/>
When I went off to Japan in '86, I left it (along with my original<br/>
ten-volume,<br/>
1700 printing of Arai Hakuseki's "Honcho Gunki-ko") with my old roommates<br/>
for<br/>
safekeeping. A mutual friend showed up a few weeks later and told them that<br/>
I'd<br/>
said she could hold on to them for me.<br/>
<br/>
Never saw 'em again.<br/>

Oh, Tony.  I'm so sorry.  Eighteen years later, that's still heartbreaking.<br/>
And that's just from my side of the screen.<br/>

 <br/>
This is a sad tale, indeed.<br/>
