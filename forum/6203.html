That would be spelt "iai".  In our alphabet, anyway.  The sword would be an<br/>
iaito, or sword for iai practise.  Was (is) she studying iaido or an<br/>
iai-jutsu style, d'you know?<br/>
To expand on someone else's response to this:  apparently (someone<br/>
knowledgeable correct me if I'm wrong, please) after DubyDubyaAyeAye the<br/>
Allies prohibited the making of swords for several ('seven' comes to mind?)<br/>
years.  (Part of the prohibition on military manufacturing, probably with a<br/>
side order of suppressing a popular national symbol of martial prowess.)<br/>
When the ban was lifted, the Japanese government wanted to be sure that the<br/>
old standards of sword quality were maintained.  (Hear, hear.)  They went<br/>
around asking some of the surviving masters how many swords they could make<br/>
in a month.  Consensus was "Two."  So there's a limit, by law, of two katana<br/>
(over 24" as I recall) per month.  I think they can make three wakizashi in<br/>
a month instead, which are shorter.<br/>
(This tends to raise the price of such blades through the ceiling, as a<br/>
moment's thought may lead you to imagine.  And that in turn has a great deal<br/>
to do with the reason my own pair of katana were made by Chen Chao-po of<br/>
Hanwei, China, a smith for whose studio's work I hold considerable<br/>
fondness.)<br/>
But I digress.  (Again.)<br/>
Now there are probably blessed few smiths left in Japan today who still use<br/>
entirely, completely, no-compromises-not-even-a-little-bit, traditional<br/>
methods for crafting a katana - from collecting the iron sand to the old<br/>
smelting process, etc.  Machines are available today that make some of those<br/>
steps produce irresistibly consistent results.  So if it doesn't take you<br/>
all month to make those two swords... well, it's a shame to waste that nice<br/>
forge and all that smithying skill.  Those apprentices are sitting around<br/>
looking mighty lazy, too.  Eat you out of house and home.  What to do to get<br/>
them moving...?<br/>

Mr. Gabriel:<br/>
<br/>
Impressive.  Your English is excellent.  Are you sure you're not a "ringer"<br/>
posting from middle Ohio?  You made me look up "concatenates."  I think I<br/>
heard the word used ONCE back in 1992.<br/>
<br/>
To the crowd at large, not just our erudite Romanian, I could be wrong, but<br/>
my ex-wife's aiee (sword) teacher (no, dear reader, I have no idea how it is<br/>
spelled, since I have never ever seen it in print) told me that the great<br/>
sword makers had stopped making katanas and moved into making kitchen<br/>
knives, since that's where the money is.  Now, I can see perhaps where it<br/>
would be extra handy to have a ginsu knife for chopping garlic instead of<br/>
your trusty katana, but maybe that's just me.  Some of you might enjoy the<br/>
garlic chopping with a larger blade.  Some of you might be a little unhinged<br/>
if you do, since that strikes me (ha) as a foolish approach.  So, is there<br/>
any truth to this rumor that the great swordmakers are still out there, just<br/>
making steak knives for Williams Sonoma?  (Incidentally, the ex and myself<br/>
are on excellent terms, so no need to fear for my safety.  Thank you for<br/>
your concern.)<br/>

were. About that site, I wish I had a sword, so that I could properly<br/>
use it by reading what is signed on it...no, no, don't fear, I don't<br/>
intend to ask for information about purchasing a katana and about<br/>
the "Samurai Way of the Sword" & Stuff  :)). I like the site,<br/>
though...<br/>
<br/>
By the way, if you get to check out EDICT, maybe you can find out<br/>
how to search for expressions, because I couldn't. Even if I<br/>
select "full regular expression", it concatenates my words into a<br/>
single one, which, of course, the server can't understand. This is<br/>
the exact link of one of the mirrors:<br/>

More likely good extra money. There is a limit on how many swords they are<br/>
allowed to produce annually.<br/>

Subject: Re: Movies on Imjin War<br/>
<br/>
Changsub,<br/>
<br/>
    I often get fascinated by obscure periods of history and start to<br/>
research them.<br/>
<br/>
    I got interested in the Imjin War (which is what I've read is the<br/>
Japanese name for the invasion of Korea in the 1590s) because of two things.<br/>
One is<br/>
the availabilty of 15mm Korean cavalry and infantry figures from Eureka<br/>
miniatures in Australia.<br/>
<br/>
    The other is a seven part series on the Korean army by Rob Morgan which<br/>
was published in the Arquebusier (a British journal dedicated to the<br/>
Renaissance period).<br/>
<br/>
    I have collected a list of references on the Imjin War, which is below.<br/>
I actually need to add to it, which I will do over the holidays and then<br/>
I'll<br/>
post them to the group's archives.<br/>
<br/>
    I did find a reference on the Internet to an upcoming Korean movie about<br/>
the Japanese invasion.  Here is what the blurb said:<br/>
<br/>
"SOLDIERS OF HEAVEN. ("Cheon-gun") A group of soldiers from North and South<br/>
<br/>
Korea are caught in a timewarp and swept back to 1592 and find themselves in<br/>
<br/>
the middle of the Imjin War. The cast includes Park Jung-hoon, Kim<br/>
<br/>
Seung-woo, Hwang Jeong-min and Kong Hyo-jin. The production company, Sidus,<br/>
<br/>
has budgeted around 8 million dollars on this project which will be filmed<br/>
<br/>
by new director Min Jun-gi. Filming began on July 20 and there is an<br/>
<br/>
estimated release sometime in April 2005."<br/>
<br/>
    I just hope it gets released with English subtitles.  If it shows a lot<br/>
of Korean soldiers I could use it as a painting guide for when I finally buy<br/>
my<br/>
Korean army.<br/>
<br/>
    If you know of any other references in English about this war, please<br/>
let<br/>
me know.<br/>
I'm especially interested in finding colour illustrations of Korean troops.<br/>
<br/>
    I've listed a booklet by the Korean Defense Department below that I<br/>
would<br/>
especially like to get a copy of.<br/>

    This article focuses on the battle that marked the turning point in the<br/>
Japanese invasion of Korea, which lasted from 1592-1598. Up to this point<br/>
the<br/>
outgunned Korean defenders had suffered defeat after defeat and been forced<br/>
to<br/>
abandon all of Koreaâ(tm)s major cities and fortresses and seek refuge<br/>
along the<br/>
Chinese border. They requested help from Ming China, Koreaâ(tm)s tributary<br/>
overlords and even though a small Ming expeditionary force was defeated in<br/>
the summer<br/>
of 1592, the Ming promised to send more aid. This arrived in early 1593 and<br/>
together with Korean troops and volunteers, the Ming overwhelmed the<br/>
Japanese<br/>
with superior firepower and recovered the city of Pyongyang, Koreaâ(tm)s<br/>
auxiliary<br/>
capital. Within months Seoul was also recovered and the Japanese never<br/>
regained<br/>
their early momentum.<br/>

Dear Bob:<br/>
As I know that you already read an English version of<br/>
'book of correction' by Yu who was a prime minister<br/>
then, I am wondering what drew your attention to the<br/>
Japanese crossing of the Imjin river.<br/>
The commander in chief of the Chosun Dynasty was not<br/>
competent, who should have held such a high military<br/>
command, only thinking about running away. There was<br/>
no significant milarty event worthy of a record except<br/>
for one incidence when a low rank officer of Chosun<br/>
dynasty scrared off some Japanese soldiers who shot<br/>
muskets for fun by shooting several arrows across the<br/>
river.<br/>
I also don't remember seeing any movies on the Imjin<br/>
crossing although I was in Korea only until 1998.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
                         Sincerely,<br/>
<br/>

I don't know much, so an expert's opinion would be most welcome. I<br/>
like the www.toledoswords.com site, mostly because it's one of the<br/>
few I have visited (so I only know about their opinion). Is it ok?<br/>
 Oh, and don't be afraid, as I have no intention on getting freaky, I<br/>
just like to learn about the historical events that have taken place<br/>
throughout the world, and in that matter the Discovery Channel has<br/>
been of great help ;)<br/>
 I am also very interested in sailships, but that does not make the<br/>
object of this forum, so sorry I've mentioned it.<br/>

 Hello Matt!<br/>
<br/>
 Funny garlic thingy there...:)) I think there should have been a<br/>
cross also. But leaving this aside (I hope this type of utterance is<br/>
permitted in english), the katana stuff was only inteded as a joke,<br/>
as I was reading a lot of "bollocks" (as Mr. Bryant said once) on<br/>
other forums regarding the Samurai matter.<br/>
<br/>
 By the way, are you familiar with the Toledo Swordmasters (the<br/>
spanish Toledo, because there are others)? They have some very nice<br/>
replicas (is that the word?) of historical swords.<br/>

Swords are still being made by the old methods by a few people. These swords<br/>
are produced in a limited quantity, (two per month per smith I believe), in<br/>
order to keep the quality high. So if you want one expect to spend a bit as<br/>
well as possibly being on a waiting list.<br/>

Your excellent suggestion yielded some websites of interest,<br/>
particularly Mr. Sinclair's articles at<br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.geocities.com/alchemyst/history.htm">http://www.geocities.com/alchemyst/history.htm</a><br/>
in which the past and current Japanese Ni-honto are discussed.<br/>
<br/>
Interestingly, he explains in that particular article the whole 24<br/>
swords a year standard and from what it sprung, and who regulates<br/>
the entire sword making trade in Japan, and so on.  It also gave me<br/>
some insights on the folks who claim to have a "Japanese Samurai<br/>
Sword from World War Two."  According to Mr. Sinclair, 90% of Showa<br/>
swords are, essentially, little more than mass-produced blades,<br/>
which is a pity.<br/>

Thomas -<br/>
Delightful.  Thanks for the recommendations.  I'd never heard of these.  I<br/>
look forward to them.<br/>
As to "Seven Samurai" - not only has it been released with revised<br/>
subtitles, it's been restored to its original release length - which had<br/>
previously not been shown outside of a few major Japanese cities in its<br/>
first run.  A student of mine also has a DVD version that includes the<br/>
theatrical trailer for the film, which is pretty delightful in itself.  But<br/>

<br/>
A couple of other movies:<br/>
<br/>
Ame Agaru (After the Rain) - a gentle story<br/>
<br/>
Twilight Samurai - another gentle story with some nice kodachi work for<br/>
those who recall<br/>
previous discussions here...<br/>
<br/>
... and Gohatto, more 'gay' than 'gentle', again with some excellent dojo<br/>
fencing which<br/>
contrasts nicely with the somewhat wild 'cut n slash' of 'the real thing'.<br/>
<br/>
The Kurosawas are, of course, mandatory.<br/>
<br/>
I have heard Seven Samurai is being re-released with revised subtitling<br/>
which is somewhat<br/>
more 'earthy' than the 50's version. Anyone know anything about this?<br/>

Saberhagen's _The<br/>
Dracula Tape_ is a rather nicely researched satire that purports to be Vlad<br/>
Tepes' own account of his visit to England, refuting the unkind reports of<br/>
Stoker and "that old sadist Van Helsing."  If you can find the novel, it<br/>

Were you interested, we do have a few sword experts<br/>
(I'm not one of them). Swords can be cool as long as<br/>
you don't get all freaky.<br/>

                Hey now, Nate.  Swords are very cool indeed, and since<br/>
they've kept me<br/>
fascinated and actively growing for the past forty-odd years, I'm not sure<br/>
whether I resemble that "all freaky" remark or not.  ...I feel so insulted.<br/>
How to handle this sense of wounded dignity in a mature and rational<br/>
manner - ha!  Got it!<br/>
Nate, we're going to have to have a duel.<br/>

Hello there,<br/>
This is Tres writing today. Love reading the discussions. I am curious as to<br/>
who knows what the birds are called on the 'Yagyu' emblem? And why they<br/>
decided to use these birds in their crest? Thanks for any information.<br/>

I am not particularly knowledgable on the various swordmakers out there - in<br/>
fact, my knowledge is probably far eclipsed by yours.<br/>
<br/>
I didn't intend the garlic remark as a joke!  I was merely thinking of what<br/>
I commonly do with kitchen knives, and one of them is chopping garlic for a<br/>
good soffrito, after you've cooked the onions in oil to a nice pale<br/>
transparency (because the onions need to cook longer than the garlic).  No<br/>
cross necessary for that.  The whole vampire myth- vampires wouldn't last a<br/>
week in Italy, would they?<br/>
<br/>
Now, why would sword makers be limited in their production of fine blades<br/>
each year?  Is it a law?  And what would be the purpose of that law, beyond<br/>
artificially driving the price of each sword up?  It sounds like a<br/>
protectionist Japanese law, sort of like how DeBeers limits the sales of<br/>
diamonds to artifically drive up the price.<br/>

Hello Matt!<br/>
<br/>
Funny garlic thingy there...:)) I think there should have been a<br/>
cross also. But leaving this aside (I hope this type of utterance is<br/>
permitted in english), the katana stuff was only inteded as a joke,<br/>
as I was reading a lot of "bollocks" (as Mr. Bryant said once) on<br/>
other forums regarding the Samurai matter.<br/>
<br/>
By the way, are you familiar with the Toledo Swordmasters (the<br/>
spanish Toledo, because there are others)? They have some very nice<br/>

No problem mentioning them. But if we're going to<br/>
discuss them for a 20 post series, then at least let's<br/>
talk about Portuguese ships going to Japan, or<br/>
something. Off topic stuff is okay, just use your<br/>
head. :)<br/>

Can you be more specific? What battles would you like?<br/>
I'm sure someone can help, but there were quite a lot<br/>
of battles in Japan over the centuries--what battle do<br/>
you want?<br/>

I love that book. I regard it as the *true* version of the Stoker account.<br/>
:)<br/>
<br/>
For the record, many years ago I wrote a term paper on Vlad Tepes. As a<br/>
former<br/>
Orthodox seminarian, I thought his was a rather interesting story of trying<br/>
to<br/>
walk a tightrope between the Orthodox Church and the RC Church with the<br/>
Turks in<br/>
the pit below waiting to gobble him up if he fell...<br/>

Do you imbue your sword with some kind of mystic<br/>
dogma? Do you believe that once drawn a sword has to<br/>
be used, or it will implode? Do you really think that<br/>
piece of steel is your soul?<br/>
<br/>
As long as you answered "no" to these, you're not a<br/>
freak.<br/>
