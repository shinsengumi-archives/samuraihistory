<div id="ygrps-yiv-1601089423">You just missed an exchange about this a few weeks ago. Perhaps you can<br/>
access the previous postings at Yahoo.<br/>
<br/>
I would strongly recommend a series of articles in last years Monumenta<br/>
Nipponica starting with issue 58:1. The first by Henry Smith was a general<br/>
overview, the second by Bito Masahide is a history of the incident. More<br/>
articles on other aspects of the story are promised.</div>
