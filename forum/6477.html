<h3>land productivity and military service</h3>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1162553643">I know that a "cho" is about 8 hectares, and I know what a "koku" <br/>

I ask all of these because I want to have a nice rough way to <br/>
guesstimate how many troops a domain of size X can reasonably field, <br/>
and comparing productivity with some of the military assessments from <br/>
the Iriki seems a good place to start. <br/>
<br/>
Is there a good place to look up how many cho were in a typical <br/>
daimyo's possession?<br/>

A cho would normally yield about 30 koku under normal circumstances. <br/>
As to how many farms would fit on a cho...it depends on the size of <br/>
the individual farms (a cho is about 100 meters square).</div>

 </span></blockquote>A "chou" is as a unit of length is 36 jou, that is: 36 x 3.03 metres (10<br/>
shaku) which equals 109.08 metres. Assuming that the unit of land area<br/>
is derived by squaring this we get: 11898.446 metres, or call it 1.19<br/>
hectares, not eight. A hectare being a lump of turf measuring 100 x 100<br/>
metres. And for those of us who don't know their hectares from their<br/>
Hectors, the above translates to a smidgen under 3 acres, okay for the<br/>
pedants amongst us 2.975 (a hectare being 2.5 acres) :-)<br/>
<br/>
As a guide, traditional rice production generates between 1 to 5 tonnes<br/>
of rice per hectare per annum, depending upon the quality of the land<br/>
and upon how many growing seasons per year you can get, which varies<br/>
between one and three. A koku, is 180 litres of rice, which is about 135<br/>
kg (ish) in the sack. Which means that roughly 1 cho of land should<br/>
produce somewhere between 8.8 and 44 koku per year, which is more or<br/>
less the same figure of 30 koku that some one else suggested.<br/>
<br/>
And the idea of three functioning farms per chou makes my brain go<br/>
sproing!<br/>

<br/>
This can be confusing. There is a chou that is a unit of length that <br/>
is roughly 109 meters. But there is another chou which is a unit of <br/>
areas. They both can be written with the kanji 町, although it's <br/>
usually more common to see the unit of length written as 丁.<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
As with all measures in Japan, much depends on the era and the <br/>
locality that is under discussion. But in modern terms, one chou is <br/>
9917.4 square meters, or 991 'ares', just slightly under 1 hectare.<br/>
<br/>
Again the precise system and modern equivalent depends greatly on <br/>
the era of Japanese history that is under discussion. but in general <br/>
the pattern is:<br/>
<br/>
Basic unit of area is one 'bu' 歩 = 3.3 square meters. Note that this <br/>
is roughly the same as the modern unit "tsubo" 坪<br/>
30 'bu' = one 'se' 畝 = 99 square meters<br/>
10 'se' = 1 'tan' (反 or sometimes 段)<br/>
10 'tan' = 1 chou (町)<br/>
<br/>
This means that one 'se' 畝 is roughly equal to one modern are, <br/>
which is 10,000 square meters, and one 'chou' 町 is essentially one <br/>
hectare.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>I can't speak for sure, but Japanese usually taught<br/>
their left-handed children to "become" right-handed.<br/>
Not just in swordsmanship, but in all things,<br/>
left-handedness was looked at as a deformity,<br/>
almost--even today, it's considered extremely strange.<br/>
The character in the movie you mention is almost<br/>
certainly a movie construct--the reason today you<br/>
don't see kendoka learning left-handed is that all<br/>
styles taught left-handedness out of their pupils. <br/>

<h3>Re: [samuraihistory]Tangent (was  Left handed swordsmen)</h3>
by <i>Michael Peters</i>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1503880922">Last year my kyudo sensei reported some problems with aspiring kyudoka in <br/>
Europe. Some were asking why they couldn't learn left handed. For kyudo it <br/>
is impossible for a number of reasons. First the viewing area is invariably <br/>
on the right in the dojo. Second, in battle formation, archers firing from <br/>
any side etc. would cause confusion in the ranks. Third, (and most <br/>
importantly), the yumi is curved in such a way that it cannot be fired <br/>
properly from a left-handed stance.<br/>
  In addition, the grip of the yumi is one of the more difficult aspects of <br/>
kyudo for the beginner to master. Being left-handed is actually a bonus in a <br/>
right-handed stance.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Almost 99.99% of swordsman were right handed. Since Japan belived in <br/>
some form of conformity at the time, left handedness was not well <br/>
recived and often left handed people were forced to be right handed. <br/>
Also they way samurai walked on roads forced them to be right handed, <br/>
since the sword was on the left side, they often walked on the left <br/>
side of the road, as not to bang their sword on someone. <br/>
<br/>
There is no disadvantage for being left handed and using a sword with <br/>
the right, aside from a minor discomfort at first, you grow out of <br/>
it. In some sword styles the left hand controlled the power of the <br/>
sword, the right controlled direction. <br/>
<br/>
As for left handed styles, I do not know completely, maybe it was a <br/>
story arch to make the character look odd compared to the rest of <br/>
society. There are some styles of iaido though that teach left handed <br/>
draws, the saya still on the left side though. Such a draw can be <br/>
seen at the end of Sanjuro.<br/>
