<h3>Letter From Will Adams, 1611</h3>
by <i>kitsuno</i>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-967331671">This is an excerpt from a letter written by Will Adams in 1611 that I <br/>
just came across, pretty interesting:<br/>
<br/>
"It was agreed that we should leave the coast of Peru and direct our <br/>
course for Japan, having understood that cloth was good merchandise <br/>
there and also how upon that coast of Peru the king's ships were out <br/>
seeking us, having knowledge of our being there, understanding that <br/>
we were weak of men, which was certain, for one of our fleet for <br/>
hunger was forced to seek relief at the enemies' hands in Saint Ago. <br/>
So we stood away directly for Japan, and passed the equinoctial line <br/>
together, until we came in twenty-eight degrees to the northward of <br/>
the line, in which latitude we were about the twenty-third of <br/>
February, 1600. We had a wondrous storm of wind as ever I was in, <br/>
with much rain, in which storm we lost our consort, whereof we were <br/>
very sorry. Nevertheless with hope that in Japan we should meet the <br/>
one the other, we proceeded on our former intention for Japan, and in <br/>
the height of thirty degrees sought the northernmost cape of the fore-<br/>
named island, but found it not by reason that it lay false in all <br/>
cards and maps and globes; for the cape lies in thirty-five degrees <br/>
and one half, which is a great difference. In the end, in thirty-two <br/>
degrees and one half we came in sight of the land, being the <br/>
nineteenth day of April. So that between the Cape of St. Maria and <br/>
Japan we were four months and twenty-two days; at which time there <br/>
were no more than six besides myself that could stand upon his feet. <br/>
<br/>
So we in safety let fall our anchor about a league from a place <br/>
called Bungo. At which time came to us many boats and we suffered <br/>
them to come aboard, being not able to resist them, which people did <br/>
us no harm, neither of us understanding the one the other. The king <br/>
of Bungo showed us great friendship, for he gave us a house and land, <br/>
where we landed our sick men, and had all refreshing that was <br/>
needful. We had when we came to anchor in Bungo, sick and whole, four <br/>
and twenty men, of which number the next day three died. The rest for <br/>
the most part recovered, saving three, which lay a long time sick, <br/>
and in the end also died. <br/>
<br/>
In the which time of our being here, the emperor hearing of us sent <br/>
presently five galleys, or frigates, to us to bring me to the court <br/>
where His Highness was, which was distant from Bungo about eighty <br/>
English leagues. So that as soon as I came before him, he demanded of <br/>
me of what country we were. So I answered him in all points, for <br/>
there was nothing that he demanded not, both concerning war and peace <br/>
between country and country; so that the particulars here to write <br/>
would be too tedious. And for that time I was commanded to prison, <br/>
being well used, with one of our mariners that came with me to serve <br/>
me. <br/>
<br/>
A two days after, the emperor called me again, demanding the reason <br/>
of our coming so far. I answered: We are a people that sought all <br/>
friendship with all nations, and to have trade in all countries, <br/>
bringing such merchandise as our country did afford into strange <br/>
lands in the way of traffic. He demanded also as concerning the wars <br/>
between the Spaniards or Portugal and our country and the reasons; <br/>
the which I gave him to understand of all things, which he was glad <br/>
to hear, as it seemed to me. <br/>
<br/>
In the end I was commanded to prison again, but my lodging was <br/>
bettered in another place. So that thirty-nine days I was in prison, <br/>
hearing no more news, neither of our ship nor captain, whether he <br/>
were recovered of his sickness or not, nor of the rest of the <br/>
company; in which time I looked every day to die, to be crossed <br/>
[crucified] as the custom of justice is in Japan, as hanging in our <br/>
land. In which long time of imprisonment, the Jesuits and the <br/>
Portuguese gave many evidences against me and the rest to the emperor <br/>
that we were thieves and robbers of all nations, and, were we <br/>
suffered to live, it should be against the profit of His Highness and <br/>
the land; for no nation should come there without robbing; His <br/>
Highness's justice being executed, the rest of our nation without <br/>
doubt should fear and not come here any more: thus daily making <br/>
access to the emperor and procuring friends to hasten my death. But <br/>
God, that is always merciful at need, showed mercy unto us and would <br/>
not suffer them to have their wills of us. In the end, the emperor <br/>
gave them answer that we as yet had not done to him nor to none of <br/>
his land any harm or damage; therefore against reason and justice to <br/>
put us to death. If our countries had war the one with the other, <br/>
that was no cause that he should put us to death; with which they <br/>
were out of heart that their cruel pretense failed them. For which <br/>
God be forever-more praised. <br/>
<br/>
Now in this time that I was in prison the ship was commanded to be <br/>
brought so near to the city where the emperor was as she might be <br/>
(for grounding her); the which was done. Forty-one days being <br/>
expired, the emperor caused me to be brought before him again, <br/>
demanding of me many questions more, which were too long to write. In <br/>
conclusion he asked me whether I were desirous to go to the ship to <br/>
see my countrymen. I answered very gladly, the which he bade me do. <br/>
So I departed and was free from imprisonment. And this was the first <br/>
news that I had that the ship and company were come to the city. So <br/>
that with a rejoicing heart I took a boat and went to our ship, where <br/>
I found the captain and the rest recovered of their sickness; and <br/>
when I came aboard with weeping eyes was received, for it was given <br/>
them to understand that I was executed long since. Thus, God be <br/>
praised, all we that were left alive came together again. <br/>
<br/>
From the ship all things were taken out, so that the clothes which I <br/>
took with me on my back I only had. All my instruments and books were <br/>
taken. Not only I lost what I had in the ship, but from the captain <br/>
and the company generally what was good or worth the taking was <br/>
carried away; all which was done unknown to the emperor. So in <br/>
process of time having knowledge of it, he commanded that they which <br/>
had taken our goods should restore it to us back again; but it was <br/>
here and there so taken that we could not get it again, saving 50,000 <br/>
R in ready money was commanded to be given us and in his presence <br/>
brought and delivered in the hands of one that was made our governor, <br/>
who kept them in his hands to distribute them unto us as we had need <br/>
for the buying of victuals for our men with other particular charges. <br/>
In the end the money was divided according to every man's place; but <br/>
this was about two years that we had been in Japan, and when we had a <br/>
denial that we should not have our ship, but to abide in Japan. So <br/>
that the part of every one being divided, every one took his way <br/>
where he thought best. In the end, the emperor gave every man, much <br/>
as was worth eleven or twelve ducats a year, namely, myself, the <br/>
captain, and mariners all alike. <br/>
<br/>
So in process of four or five years the emperor called me, as divers <br/>
times he had done before. So one time above the rest he would have me <br/>
to make him a small ship. I answered that I was no carpenter and had <br/>
no knowledge thereof. "Well, do your endeavor," said he; "if it be <br/>
not good, it is no matter." Wherefore at his command I built him a <br/>
ship of the burden of eighty tons or thereabout; which ship being <br/>
made in all respects as our manner is, he coming aboard to see it, <br/>
liked it very well; by which means I came in favor with him, so that <br/>
I came often in his presence, who from time to time gave me presents, <br/>
and at length a yearly stipend to live upon, much about seventy <br/>
ducats by the year with two pounds of rice a day daily. Now being in <br/>
such grace and favor by reason I learned him some points of geometry <br/>
and understanding of the art of mathematics with other things, I <br/>
pleased him so that what I said he would not contrary. At which my <br/>
former enemies did wonder, and at this time must entreat me to do <br/>
them a friendship, which to both Spaniards and Portuguese have I <br/>
done, recompensing them good for evil. So to pass my time to get my <br/>
living, it hath cost me great labor and trouble at the first; but God <br/>
hath blessed my labor. <br/>
<br/>
In the end of five years I made supplication to the king to go out of <br/>
this land, desiring to see my poor wife and children according to <br/>
conscience and nature. With the which request the emperor was not <br/>
well pleased, and would not let me go any more for my country, but to <br/>
bide in his land. Yet in process of time, being in great favor with <br/>
the emperor, I made supplication again, by reason we had news that <br/>
the Hollanders were in Shian and Patania; which rejoiced us much with <br/>
hope that God should bring us to our country again by one means or <br/>
other. So I made supplication again, and boldly spoke myself with <br/>
him, at which he gave me no answer. I told him if he would permit me <br/>
to depart, I would be a means that both the English and Hollanders <br/>
should come and traffic there. But by no means he would let me go. I <br/>
asked him leave for the captain, the which he presently granted me. <br/>
So by that means my captain got leave, and in a Japan junk sailed to <br/>
Pattan; and in a year's space came to Hollanders. In the end, he went <br/>
from Patane to Ior, where he found a fleet of nine sail, of which <br/>
fleet Matleef was general, and in this fleet he was made master <br/>
again, which fleet sailed to Malacca and fought with an armado of <br/>
Portugal; in which battle he was shot and presently died; so that, as <br/>
I think, no certain news is known whether I be living or dead. <br/>
Therefore I do pray and entreat you in the name of Jesus Christ to do <br/>
so much as to make my being here in Japan known to my poor wife, in a <br/>
manner a widow and my two children fatherless; which thing only is my <br/>
greatest grief of heart and conscience. I am a man not unknown in <br/>
Ratcliffe and Limehouse, by name to my good Master Nicholas Diggines <br/>
and M. Thomas Best and M. Nicholas Isaac and William Isaac, brothers, <br/>
with many others; also to M. William Jones and M. Becket. Therefore <br/>
may this letter come to any of their hands or the copy, I do know <br/>
that compassion and mercy is so that my friends and kindred shall <br/>
have news that I do as yet live in this vale of my sorrowful <br/>
pilgrimage; the which thing again and again I do desire for Jesus <br/>
Christ his sake."</div>
