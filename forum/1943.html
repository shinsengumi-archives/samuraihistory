<h3>Willam,Cruse and the big screen(Samurai William)</h3>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1441232184">I actully saw the book that is being spoken about a week ago in a <br/>
borders. And flipping through it it seemed more acurate to history <br/>
than SHogun.(which is a work of fiction as we all well know)Though i <br/>
didn't buy it it's on my list.<br/>
<br/>
Ironicly enough i was in a cinama a few weeks back and saw a preview <br/>
for a movie called "The Last Samurai" starring Mr. Cruse. point is, <br/>
it seems like a shogun remake(shorter of course) but i wonder if it <br/>
will show more of Williams life or just Holliwood-afy the whole time <br/>
period. Also i will be watching for acurices in swordmenship, dress, <br/>
language and customs.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Ummmm.... it has nothing to do with William Adams. "The Last Samurai" is a<br/>
ficitional story about an American soldier in Japan in the 1860s-70s.<br/>
