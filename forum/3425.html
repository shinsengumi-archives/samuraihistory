<h3>Samurai is not christian</h3>
by <i>mahamayuri</i>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-877852663">There is no Christian Samurai.<br/>
Those so-called Christian "Samurai" acted in threachery against an expressed<br/>
order of Lord Tokugawa Ieyassu and attempted to terminate with his life in<br/>
order to impose christianism in Japan as it was done at other countries. So,<br/>
they was not betrayed their own lord, but the land, the way of their<br/>
ancestors and the way of the Samurai in itself.<br/>
<br/>
Just to be born with samurai ancestry and know how to handle a sword does<br/>
not make anyone a Samurai.<br/>
<br/>
Much of the samurai "way-of-thinking" is from Buddhism and Shintoism (or<br/>
Shindô that means "The Way of the Gods").<br/>
<br/>
Christians should search in history to real sources to seek for their pride<br/>
instead of borrowing elements of other cultures and put in them the seal of<br/>
their god. Unfortunatelly there is so much people-like-hitler in<br/>
Christianism, just like Hitler himself ("I am now as before a Catholic and<br/>
will always remain so" Adolph Hitler, 1941), Charles Magne (killed more than<br/>
4000 saxons for refusal to convert to christianism), Olaf the Holy and Olaf<br/>
Tryggvarsson (of Norway, they also did thousands of sword-pointed<br/>
convertions and prosecuted their native religions there that have several<br/>
common elements with Shinto), Oda Nobunaga Shogun (killed many buddhist<br/>
monks, destroyed many buddhists monasteries and entire villages and their<br/>
respectives villagers slaughtered just for dwelling near those monasteries)<br/>
and very few good and coherent examples like St. Francisco of Assis (his<br/>
order in some periods of history was even prosecuted due to that).<br/>

samurai, even Christian daimyo. Nobunaga had a Christian son, for crying out loud.<br/>

<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1595206174">Traitors or not there were samurai who converted to<br/>
christianity. There were Daimyo who converted and even<br/>
endorsed christianity(Otomo Sorin). Most of whom did<br/>
so to attain foriegn support especially when stonger<br/>
clans were invading their territories.<br/>
<br/>
As for Lord Tokugawa Ieyasu(whom I have much respect<br/>
for) was not in power when Francis Xvavier came to<br/>
shore on Kyushu. He wasn't even lord of Mikawa yet.<br/>
What was being discused was not if christan samurai<br/>
betrayed their lords of culture. But a discussion of<br/>
those who were christian and were to research them.<br/>
<br/>
This is an important part of the Sengoku period.<br/>

<br/>
  There is no Christian Samurai.<br/>
  .......wrong<br/>
<br/>
  Those so-called Christian "Samurai" acted in threachery against an expressed<br/>

  order to impose christianism in Japan as it was done at other countries. So,<br/>

  .......wrong again sorry<br/>
<br/>
  Just to be born with samurai ancestry and know how to handle a sword does<br/>
  not make anyone a Samurai.<br/>
  ........yes it does<br/>
<br/>
  Much of the samurai "way-of-thinking" is from Buddhism and Shintoism (or<br/>
  Shindô that means "The Way of the Gods").<br/>
  ..The samurai "way of thinking" is all about honor, bravery and above all <br/>
  else loyalty it had little to do with religion.<br/>
<br/>
  Christians should search in history to real sources to seek for their pride<br/>
  instead of borrowing elements of other cultures and put in them the seal of<br/>
  their god.<br/>
  ...Real sources? .....borrowing?<br/>
   Unfortunatelly there is so much people-like-hitler in<br/>
  Christianism, just like Hitler himself ("I am now as before a Catholic and<br/>
  will always remain so" Adolph Hitler, 1941), Charles Magne (killed more than<br/>

  Tryggvarsson (of Norway, they also did thousands of sword-pointed<br/>
  convertions and prosecuted their native religions there that have several<br/>
  common elements with Shinto)<br/>
  .....Many bad things were done in the name of religion in many parts of the<br/>
  world by many different people representing many different religions it <br/>
  would be unfair to single out only one.<br/>
<br/>
  , Oda Nobunaga Shogun (killed many buddhist<br/>
  monks, destroyed many buddhists monasteries and entire villages and their<br/>
  respectives villagers slaughtered just for dwelling near those monasteries)<br/>
  and very few good and coherent examples like St. Francisco of Assis (his<br/>
  order in some periods of history was even prosecuted due to that).<br/>
  .....Yes Nobunaga did these things, but nobunaga was not a Christian, and<br/>
  he did not kill them because they were buddhists but because they were a <br/>
  military threat.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>As a matter of fact, during the Tokugawa (or Edo) period (1603-1868) <br/>
handling a sword was an optional for many samurai. 'Samurai' was a <br/>
recognized social class, and males born into it WERE samurai - The rest <br/>
is fiction.<br/>
<br/>
Regarding Christian daimyo, there were a bunch, especially in Kyushu <br/>
and since the 15th c. in the 16th c., Nobunaga liked them, because he <br/>
was radically anti-Buddhist (or better: anti Buddhist ikki); while <br/>
Hideyoshi was highly suspicious - in fact he sent many of them to fight <br/>
and possibly get slaughtered in Korea (1592-98). The Tokugawa, <br/>
gradually exterminated most Christians, apart from the ones who <br/>
re-converted, went undercover for good, or managed to escape. As far as <br/>
I know, some went to Manila, and some other to Siam. Interestingly Siam <br/>
(today's Thailand) was a strongly Buddhist country, but very tolerant <br/>
towards other  religion - an openness probably coming from centuries of <br/>
trading with the Arabs and the Indians.<br/>

have used deception and get in to attempt the spread of their message or tell <br/>
the truth, probably get killed and never get a word in about their message?  <br/>
To me, missionary work can take on many disguises, because it's a matter of <br/>
using whatever means you have to to get your message out and if you believe it's <br/>
that important, you die for it.  As someone said, it's a matter of WHICH <br/>
(L)ord you're dying for.  In their cases, they were dying for a Lord Not Of This <br/>
World.  They adhered absolutely to the tenets of bushido in that they served <br/>
their highest Lord to the death.  Show me one samurai who never lied or used <br/>
falsehood or murdered or committed some form of treason to protect his lord -- <br/>
human or Otherwise -- and I'll show you a liar.  :-)<br/>
       As for Nobunaga, what about the threat of the Ikko Ikki?  Do you think <br/>
they wanted to party hearty?  Do you think they were going to try and <br/>
proselytize him and his army?  Hardly likely.  It is unlikely that a majority of the <br/>
people who stood in Nobunaga's way, even if they did congeal into a potent <br/>
fighting force, would have stood a chance against a brilliant general such as the <br/>
leader of the Oda and his right hand man, Toyotomi, this is true.  But that <br/>
wasn't the issue.  The issue was that anyone who stood in Oda's way of unifying <br/>
Japan -- in WHATEVER WAY THAT WAS -- was seen as a threat.  Any threat -- no <br/>
matter how great or small, or how justified or unjustified -- must be removed. <br/>
 Therefore, the genocide, however indefencible to us, was very defencible to <br/>
HIM, and quite frankly, that's the only opinion about the issue that really <br/>
mattered in the end, although it is nice to bat it around and say "what if" and <br/>
"what was he thinking?" now with four hundred years plus of hindsight.<br/>
       And I must throw my hat into the ring about it too -- I may not be a <br/>
Catholic (either belief or by church membership), but these anti-Catholic posts <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1854285849">I'm not anti-catholic.  I'm not an athiest.  But in defense of those <br/>
with varying opinions, the posts were actually related to Samurai <br/>
History.  I would question the validity of many of the "anti-<br/>
catholic" statements but some actually make sense.  <br/>
The Catholic church does have some ugly history, as does Japan.  I've <br/>
read articles that the Japanese education system has attempted to <br/>
remove any history of WWII from its textbooks.  Many have been up in <br/>
arms about it.  Just because they want Japanese students to know the <br/>
attrocities committed under Japanewse Imperialism does that make them <br/>
"anti-Japan"?  History, no matter how ugly, should be preserved and <br/>
talked about.  Not shut out because it seems to be saying something <br/>
bad about what you believe in.  We should embrace the past and take <br/>
it for what it is.  <br/>
As for Samurai Christians, they did exist.  It was stated that those <br/>
Christians should not have been called Samurai.  I think the reverse <br/>
may have been more true.  Due to the commitment and values of the <br/>
Samurai, it would be difficult and problematic to be a Christian.  <br/>
Even so, they were definately Samurai.<br/>
It shouldn't be a surprise that the Church tried to incorporate <br/>
native traditions, values, and practices into the religion.  Take a <br/>
look at our major holidays (Easter and Christmas have pagan <br/>
influences) as well as early literature (Beowulf).  <br/>

<h3>Re: [samuraihistory] Re: Samurai is not christian</h3>
by <i>twheels2many</i>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1672875867">Let me say first off that you've misunderstood Christianity and Buddhism and most world religions if you think that the point is simply morality. Sure, most religions have a system of morality, but the defining of good and bad is NOT the point. In Christianity the point is peace with God through faith in Christ. In Buddhism the point is the cessation of individual existence in an illusory world, to exist only in Nirvana. Christians want to propogate their religion because they believe people will be judged by God when they die, and so they think people need forgiveness to enter heaven instead of hell. Buddhists propogate their religion because they believe people are blinded by the material world from their need to escape into a painless and selfless existence in Nirvana. It IS the root principle that matters. The moral system is a reflection of the root belief. That's why Buddhist morals and Christian morals are so different. They DON"T teach the same thing. I'd assume from your post that you're not a very religious guy. Talk to anybody who takes their religion seriously and you'll find that the beliefs are most important, not the least important.<br/>
<br/>
Which, that's why the Jesuit missionaries tried to clothe Christian truth in the fashion of contemporary Japanese religion. Christian beliefs with Japanese rituals or practice. It's the underlying  belief that is most important. So, in theory, if you make it look a little more Japanese, it becomes easier for the Japanese to understand, but the core beliefs remain intact. This method of propogating Roman Catholic faith was used by their missionaries a lot. It isn't looked at as deceitful, but simply as communicating their beliefs in such a way as to be more easily understood, and to some extent, in a manner more palatable to the mind of the one being taught. Some of this has to do with Aristotelian distinctions between the accident and occident of a thing... The "accident" is the appearance of a thing. The "occident" is the core essence. The accident doesn't matter nearly as much as the occident. So, as long as the same core belief is being taught, then the Catholics didn't care what it looked like. (In actual practice, though, the old Catholic method tends toward syncretism... mixing of both belief and ritual... so nothing remains in its pure form).<br/>

Though the parties of each agenda are separate as to their intentions, they nonetheless seem to operate side by side. Sometimes it seems as if the missionaries are leading the way, and the imperialists are riding along in hopes of using the mission religion as a foothold for their economic plans. And sometimes it seems the other way around, like the Imperialists are leading the way and the missionaries are riding along to use the new colonization as an attempt to gain a foothold for religious purposes. Don't make the mistake of blending the two together, though. Missionaries and Merchants/Ambassadors are often like siamese twins that can't stand eachother. Always in the same place, but for totally different reasons, often despising the goals of the other. The Jesuits in Japan were there for love of the people. But they were accompanied by others who were there for the love of money.<br/>

<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-112286873">Hiya,<br/>
<br/>
I understand the point of religions, but to me their point and the<br/>
point of the beliefs (in the grander scale, what Christ, Buddha, and<br/>
such taught) are different. To me, the inherent meaning of<br/>
Christianity and the other beliefs is the morality (of course,<br/>
morality is such a vague word, it can change depending on the POV of<br/>
the society it comes from). You are right, I'm not a religious person,<br/>
which is not to say I don't believe in God, or even in the grand tale<br/>
of angels, demons, and the rise and fall from grace of mankind, etc.<br/>
What I don't believe in is in religions. I strip down the Message to<br/>
its essence: do good and be rewarded (I'm making it sound simpler than<br/>
it is, but I won't go into too much detail). And one of the main<br/>
reasons, if not the main one, why I do not believe in religions is<br/>
precisely that very fervent (sp?) people do give more weight to the<br/>
individual and unique aspects of their religions than to what really<br/>
matters. Why is it that even amongst same Beliefs the different<br/>
religions don't agree much and make those disagreements into something<br/>
that matters? As if being a good person but NOT believing in God will<br/>
take you to Hell, but one that is evil and constantly repents and<br/>
confesses to the priest, and do all the things the religion requires<br/>
will take you to Heaven, That doesn't make sense to me. So, once<br/>
again, I strip it down to the core. Even the Samurai code has that<br/>
inherent message of goodness embedded on it.<br/>

point is peace with God through faith in Christ. In Buddhism the point<br/>
is the cessation of individual existence in an illusory world, to<br/>
exist only in Nirvana. Christians want to propogate their religion<br/>
because they believe people will be judged by God when they die, and<br/>
so they think people need forgiveness to enter heaven instead of hell.<br/>
Buddhists propogate their religion because they believe people are<br/>
blinded by the material world from their need to escape into a<br/>
painless and selfless existence in Nirvana. It IS the root principle<br/>
that matters. The moral system is a reflection of the root belief.<br/>
That's why Buddhist morals and Christian morals are so different. They<br/>
DON"T teach the same thing. I'd assume from your post that you're not<br/>
a very religious guy. Talk to anybody who takes their religion<br/>
seriously and you'll find that the beliefs are most important, not the<br/>
least important.<br/>

beliefs with Japanese rituals or practice. It's the underlying  belief<br/>
that is most important. So, in theory, if you make it look a little<br/>
more Japanese, it becomes easier for the Japanese to understand, but<br/>
the core beliefs remain intact. This method of propogating Roman<br/>
Catholic faith was used by their missionaries a lot. It isn't looked<br/>
at as deceitful, but simply as communicating their beliefs in such a<br/>
way as to be more easily understood, and to some extent, in a manner<br/>
more palatable to the mind of the one being taught. Some of this has<br/>
to do with Aristotelian distinctions between the accident and occident<br/>
of a thing... The "accident" is the appearance of a thing. The<br/>
"occident" is the core essence. The accident doesn't matter nearly as<br/>
much as the occident. So, as long as the same core belief is being<br/>
taught, then the Catholics didn't care what it looked like. (In actual<br/>
practice, though, the old Catholic method tends toward syncretism...<br/>
mixing of both belief and ritual... so nothing remains in its pure form).<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-913121677">Well, you can believe what you want to believe. Just realize that your personal religious views are NOT the "stripped down essence" of the teachings of Christ or Buddha. You've more or less made up your own personal religion. Which is pretty audacious. You're taking a very deconstructionist approach to religion, and divorcing the religious beliefs from the intent of the original teachers, redefining it and reconstructing it to suit yourself. Which again, is audacious.<br/>
<br/>
And as we've discussed a lot on this group... the samurai code doesn't have much to do with the historical samurai. And as for inherent goodness... have you read the hagakure? A lot of it has to do with how to kill other people. Not a lot of inherent goodness in that.<br/>
<br/>
If you want to discuss religious views, we should probably do that off-group...<br/>
