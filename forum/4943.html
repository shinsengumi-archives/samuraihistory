<div id="ygrps-yiv-547162318">Hello Mark <br/>
<br/>
I'll try , First do as much research as you can ,<br/>
collect books that feature Samurai and also down load<br/>
pics from the internet, Study the many types of armour<br/>
and if you want to make a set for your self then<br/>
settle down with that model and with that your<br/>
research begins again, research material, assemply<br/>
techniques and so on. Local museums may have some that<br/>
you can get a close up and may even allow for you to<br/>
take a pic of it on display. Also consider just what<br/>
you intend to do with your armour. Is it display, or<br/>
is for living history like I'm trying to do now ? Will<br/>
it need to function like the real thing? or will it be<br/>
stood in a class case to be admired ? Also you need to<br/>
consider your sizes and how all the armour comes<br/>
together. Dont forget what needs to be worn under it<br/>
all. Thats starting from the ground up. Underware to<br/>
finally your sword. Each piece needs hours of research<br/>
and development. Good luck and have fun.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Well, I wasn't going to give his name, since he hasn't<br/>
paid me my agent fee in a few weeks. He's normally<br/>
pretty good about answering the mail, though, so give<br/>
him a little time. You'll see him on the board or the<br/>
list as Tony, or Anthony J. Bryant. (Tony, that check<br/>
better be in the mail...)<br/>
<br/>
As for helping with how to lace the lames, I'm<br/>
clueless. I've not attempted this at all, so I<br/>
couldn't help. But you can try the links he's got on<br/>
his site, since i think he links to a couple of armor<br/>
making sites that might help you. Also, if you go to<br/>
www.samurai-archives.com and go to the messageboard<br/>
there (it's a delphi forum), I know there are several<br/>
people on the board who have used Tony's site as a<br/>
basis for their armor making, and they could probably<br/>
help you. <br/>
<br/>
Cheers!<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1979271262">Hello ANTHONY J. BRYANT (TONY),<br/>
  My question was about the lasing of the lames for all parts of the samurai armour. I would like to know if you have any more diagrams, tips, or info. on how to lase the armour together so I better understasnd it. I looked at hundreds of different suits of armour and now that i've picked out what kind I want to make, i just need to understand the construction process better. I'm trying to make a battle ready suit of samurai armour. I'm not going to have it on display or anything like that. I'm trying to get into the re- enactment stuff so i need it strong and very durable. Also, is titanium a good metal to use for the lames or should i stick with stainless steel? And, what thickness of steel and leather backing should i use for the backing? Do i harden the leather? Whats the best way to attach leather, cloth, and lames together. I would gladly send you money for any shipping charges if you could put together some info. and send it to me. Hope to here from you soon.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>I was out of town over the week-end. If you e-mailed me over then, I probably <br/>
killed it accidentally when I got back and started wiping out the 300+ spam <br/>
messages that accumulated while I was gone.<br/>
<br/>
What was the question? There are lacing diagrams on the site... what do you want <br/>
that isn't there?<br/>

<h3>samurai armour</h3>
by <i>captainnemo12901</i>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-363910316">I am making a model of a samurai (or at least trying to) and I need <br/>
to know how many pieces of armour I need to make and if anyone can <br/>
direct me to a very well illustrated or diagram of a suit of <br/>
armour.All help will be appreciated. Also did the horses the men ride <br/>
have barding like the European knight's horse? If so what were the <br/>
pieces, and what were they called and where on the horse did it go. <br/>
     thanks allot, <br/>
              captain nemo</div>
