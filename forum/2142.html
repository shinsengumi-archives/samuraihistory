<div id="ygrps-yiv-259879510">Bob Burke recently brought up the Satsuma Rebellion of 1877 in one <br/>

 </span></blockquote>Shogun was based on pshudo historical fact, hence the historical <br/>
fiction label. where as the Satsuma rebellion actully happend. Though <br/>
i would be interisted to know if there where any non japanese as part <br/>
of the rebellion other than in ports. <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-646369973">Probably a combination of a crapfest with a movie that tries to be <br/>
accurate, but being Hollywood it probably leans more toward crap. <br/>
I'll still go to see it, it's a samurai movie after all, and it does <br/>
seem interesting.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1829937602">To be honest I expect a lot of "wire fighting", swords chopping cannonballs in half (or some such) a good bit of Matrix style acrobatics-"Super Samurai" decimating 30 opponents with one mighty blow.... It'll probably transfer the old "Super-Human Ninja" character to the "Super-Human Samurai"- without the entertainment value of "Crouching Tiger-Hidden Dragon"--(which I really enjoyed-& I'm not ashamed to admit it) Of course I might not have any idea what I'm talking about and it may turn out to be one helluva great flik.....Ronin<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1917941353">Shogun was a miniseries in the late 1970's (1979?) or<br/>
maybe 1980 and while it was probably the best<br/>
available at the time, it was sometimes painful once I<br/>
knew better. The miniseries and book started many of<br/>
us on the path, but when you actually study the<br/>
history, the whole love story et al is SOOO<br/>
contrived...not to mention the language errors in both<br/>
the book and the miniseries...<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-267182515">It's great. But there has to be some willing<br/>
suspension of disbelief. No way would Hosokawa Gracia<br/>
and Will Adams, the real characters that Mariko and<br/>
Blackthorne were based loosely on, have gotten<br/>
together. NO WAY. As long as you don't take it too<br/>
seriously, it's a lot of fun. But a lot of western<br/>
misconceptions are there--like the ninja mystique,<br/>
incorrect translations of Japanese, notions of samurai<br/>
honor that didn't really exist until much later (or at<br/>
least we're not codified)....it plays on a lot of<br/>
samurai stereotypes that are frustrating if you know<br/>
better. Down to things like that the main Daimyo had<br/>
uniforms for their samurai--um, no.<br/>
<br/>
But literary wise, it's a fun read. <br/>

 </span></blockquote>It depends on what you consider to be "fiction."<br/>
<br/>
To me, it fails greatly in the historical accuracy, historical verisimilitude, and linguistic accuracy (etc.) tests.<br/>
To some people, that's not a problem.<br/>
<br/>
Let me give you an example. In the current issue of Hitchcock Magazine, there's a "Heian period" murder mystery. It's<br/>
set in the eleventh century. Except I recognize the Japanese story used as the basis for it -- a story that took<br/>
place a century later (because there was a war that figured in the background, and one of the characters is<br/>
historical). I also recognized that the author made some anachronisms with names (using a very late period name for a<br/>
woman character in the story). I was also thrown off because of mentions of cotton clothing and candles, neither of<br/>
which existed in Japan during the  Heian period. So.... is that a good story? To some, yes. To me, no. There was too<br/>
much wrong with it that kept throwing me *out* of the story.<br/>
<br/>
Like some people stop reading detective fiction where someone puts a silencer on a revolver. Or removes "the clip"<br/>
from a revolver. Both of which I see often -- it means the writer really doesn't know guns, and hasn't done the<br/>
research -- it makes me wonder what else might be wrong that I *don't* know about.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-41842235">Shogun was a mini-series, 10 hours, and is coming out on DVD in <br/>
Sept. I also believe they made a shorter tv movie of Shogun, that <br/>
probaly isnt that good since they would have to cut out 8-7 hours of <br/>
the storyline.  <br/>
<br/>
Kagemusha is infact about Takeda Shingen and how after he died, due <br/>
to a bullet wound, his head generals got a double to pretend to be <br/>
him. They managed to hide his death for a year, I believe. The movie <br/>
has Nobunaga and Ieyasu in it, but its not about Nobunaga. By the <br/>
way, this did actually happen.<br/>
<br/>
Ive seen a few Kurosawa films, and they seem very accurate. I <br/>
recommend any Kurosawa film.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1279226037">Hey There.<br/>
       I might go see it.  To be honest, I'm not a big movie person, and I'm <br/>
even less of a Tom Cruise fan, even if I do like some of his older work (Top <br/>
Gun and A Few Good Men being personal faves).  I'd much rather read the book.  <br/>
Hence, the question about Clavell's novel, Shogun.  I'm thinking of seeing <br/>
Jason v Freddie, but only because it's been anticipated for how long now?.  (And <br/>
I'm not a slasher fan either.)  To be honest, if I thought back on the last <br/>
five movies I saw in the theater, I'd be hardpressed, it would go back nearly <br/>
three years and the only non-cartoon would be My Big Fat Greek Wedding.<br/>
       Anyway,  thanks for the info on Shogun at any rate.  (Yeah, I know <br/>
this is the third time I've said that.  :-)!)<br/>

Seriously though, can you think of any historical movie that somebody<br/>
somewhere didn't take the piss out of it because it wasn't "accurate?". It<br/>
seems a knee jerk reaction among some to jump all over a movie trying to<br/>
find something wrong just be a pain in the ass to others.</div>

cinematic effect. We all know that the Nagashino scene<br/>
in "Kagemusha" isn't the way it really happened--the<br/>
Takeda cavalry didn't die in a 9 minute span from<br/>
rapid-fire Oda arqubusiers mowing them down like WWI<br/>
German machine gunners against a British "Over the<br/>

<br/>
I'm anticipating that this will not be the case--not<br/>
with Tom Cruise in it. They'll mess something up.<br/>
Maybe it's just my natural bias against this time<br/>
period, and the fact that I'm sure that there will be<br/>
a gaudy amount of talk about Bushido and honor and<br/>
stereotypical crap, and that some of the language will<br/>
be wrong, and the costumes, and other things that<br/>

I might like it, despite whatever is wrong. I'm just<br/>
not getting my hopes up. <br/>

<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1166197753">Well, I got my hands on what I have been told is a very early draft <br/>
of 'The Last Samurai', but although you have to keep in mind that it <br/>
is an early draft (July 20th, 2001) there were some despicably <br/>
typical mistakes.  Here is an excerpt:<br/>
<br/>
---------------------<br/>
-JAMES starts to turn away.  HIROSHI finally speaks.<br/>
<br/>
HIROSHI<br/>
On the day of battle, a champion is chosen.  He rides ahead of his <br/>
army, meets the challenger of the enemy.  The victor brings great <br/>
acclaim to himself, to his clan.  A dozen times I rode out as <br/>
champion, a dozen men I killed.  In only one contest did I know <br/>
fear.  Our combat seemed to last an eternity, by the grace of some <br/>
god I prevailed...  I had never been more proud to be samurai, to <br/>
take an enemy's head.  I raised it high on my pike... Learned later <br/>
the warrior's son, a six-year old boy, had watched it all from the <br/>
castle walls.  That boy was Daigo Masakado.<br/>
----------------------<br/>
<br/>
That looks to me like something that would have been pretty much <br/>
outdated even in the 15th century, let alone the 19th, and there is <br/>
of course the obligatory trip to the geisha house.  There are lots <br/>
of things like that - some things that make it little better than <br/>
the meiji-era samurai classic "the barbarian and the geisha".  <br/>
although, like I said, assuming this is truly an early version of <br/>
the script, I HOPE they would have worked out the most obvious <br/>
problems.  The first scene of the movie, if they keep it as I have <br/>
here, should be real good, though.  The battle scenes have potential <br/>
to say the least.<br/>

<h3>Re: The Last Samurai? Good? Bad?</h3>
by <i>miburo_saitoh</i>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1847290319">Thanks, that's cool that it really happened. I'm on a Kurosawa <br/>
shopping spree, so far I have Seven Samurai and Ran, I'm aiming next <br/>
at either The Hidden Fortress or Throne of Blood, both look really <br/>
good, after that Yojimbo, etc...<br/>
<br/>
As for The Last Samurai, last week I read that it is directed by <br/>
Edward Zwick, who was the director of Glory, an american civil war <br/>
movie, and even though I'm sure it has many historical flaws <br/>
(including some of the main characters being made up) it treated the <br/>
subject matter with respect and was very well done (it's one of my <br/>
favorite), so now I have a lil bit more hope with Last Samurai...<br/>
