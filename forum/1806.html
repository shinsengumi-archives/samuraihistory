<div id="ygrps-yiv-1739133611">Hey there.<br/>
  Me again again.  8-)  The ninja, if all I've heard from everyone in this <br/>
group and everything I've read is correct and I believe it is, were real.  The <br/>
assassin part, though, is more hollywood than anything.  They were more into <br/>
espionage and were information gatherers rather than assassins, although they <br/>
were more than likely used for that purpose if needed.  (Reference: Fuma Kotaro <br/>
-- b. Kazama Kotaro -- led a ninja band for the Hojo clan in the Sengoku <br/>
period.  The band, if memory serves, were involved in a war, but not necessarily as <br/>
spies as much as guerillas.  Again if memory serves, he was executed in 1603 <br/>
as a common criminal.)  Hope this helps!  8-)<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-516817855">Hi<br/>
<br/>
Did Ninja exist - yes and no<br/>
<br/>
First you have to completely forget Hollywood, they<br/>
havent even come close to portraying the ninja yet. In<br/>
fact many Japanese movies dont even portray them<br/>
properly yet<br/>
<br/>
The term ninja is new - in the past they were called<br/>
shinbo - suppa - kussa - iga no mono - koga no mono,<br/>
the list is endless.<br/>
<br/>
Every school/family of ninjutsu was different. some<br/>
specialised in warfare tactics sop they basically<br/>
ceased to exist once wars declined, some maybe even<br/>
continued right up to the meiji period to today. Today<br/>
the katori Shinto ryu has ninjutsu in its training<br/>
curriculum. One school of ninjutsu, even used young<br/>
girls to obtain pillow secrets which there then passed<br/>
on.<br/>
<br/>
Some Ninja schools did carryout the clandestine<br/>
activities that you read about, but little is know of<br/>
these types of ninja as there activities are recorded.<br/>
Three documents written by ninja exist today.<br/>
bansenshukai, ninpiden, Shoninki. however all were<br/>
written some  years into the beginning days of the edo<br/>
period. <br/>
<br/>
The last two know recorded activities of ninja was at<br/>
the Shimabara rebellion where they failed (due to not<br/>
having the local accent and old age)and some were even<br/>
injured, and the last I know of is one ninja climbed<br/>
about a dutch ship in the 1800's and stole a menu. if<br/>
he could read dutch he would not have taken the menu.<br/>
<br/>
Hope this helps<br/>
<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-2074771739">Hi There<br/>
<br/>
I can recommend Stephen Turnbull's "Ninja" - ISBN 1 85314 109 7. It is an excellent and comprehensive work, although I am sure there will be some who disagree!!     Currently selling at a reasonable £7.95 on Amazon.....<br/>
<br/>
                            Rod Johnson<br/>
<br/>
Synopsis on Amazon site<br/>
This is a true and revealing account of the Ninja, the Japanese clandestine warrior cult of assassins and spies that has acquired a legendary status among martial arts enthusiasts and military historians. From material previously unpublished in the West, Stephen Turnbull recounts the history, battles, science, mysticism and even the modern aspects of the Ninja. Many of the sources for this book are his own translations from Japanese archives. Myths about the Ninja are exploded but the truth emerges here as far stronger than any fiction, making this work destined to become the standard work. <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1719246032">Hi<br/>
<br/>
Turnbulls book is very good except he has written only<br/>
about samurai doing ninja things.<br/>
<br/>
I feel that if you write a book about ninja you should<br/>
at least include them.<br/>
<br/>
However, it is maybe one fo the best books on the<br/>
subject in the english language and a great lace to<br/>
start learning about the ninja. I recommend it<br/>
