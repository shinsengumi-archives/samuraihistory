<h3>Greetings and question about meetings</h3>
by <i>rodjuri</i>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1011905976">Greetings:<br/>
<br/>
I am Rodrigo Juri. I belonged to that forum a year ago, but I changed<br/>
my email, so I recently, indeed just today, I have get into it again.<br/>
I posted very few thing, mainly questions, and I will be always be in<br/>
debt with one of yours that suggested me to check Deux Destroyed for<br/>
my research.<br/>
Well, my research has taken me finnaly to the doors of the Imperial<br/>
Palace, and it seems that I will be here for a long time.<br/>
So, do you know about conferences or conventions for people like you<br/>
or me (gaijin desu), in Tokyo area, that would like to speak and hear<br/>
about medieval history in Japan? I mean... not truly academic ones,<br/>
but neither anime-like ones. Although, if a truly academic one is open<br/>
for public, could be of help anyway.<br/>
<br/>
And... how many of yours are in Tokyo actually? Do you do same kind of<br/>
periodical meetings or convention? I would like to join such kind of<br/>
effort, if it is possible. <br/>
 <br/>
Ahhh... please forgive my bad english... I am not a native english<br/>
speaker, I am chilean so far.<br/>
<br/>
Thank you everybody.</div>

	Not sure anybody answered you but here is my input. The Japanese Art  <br/>
Sword Preservation Society NBTHK, and the Japanese Sword Preservation  <br/>
Society NTHK, both have monthly meetings in Tokyo, many of the  <br/>
members are like minded individuals with a deep appreciation of  <br/>
Japanese Art, History, Politics and of course Arms and Armour. New  <br/>
members are always welcome and I am sure you can find other groups  <br/>
like this one, thru contacts there.<br/>
	I would also suggest keeping an eye out for museum exhibitions  <br/>
featuring reenactment groups, they do exist in Japan and while some  <br/>
are given to cardboard costumes many are serious collectors and  <br/>
students of history. If you are indeed in Tokyo you are sure to find  <br/>
a world of people and things to satisfy your interest.<br/>
in envy,<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-2050706671">Thank you Tom san:<br/>
<br/>
I will begin my search with this two institutions than you offer. Thank you for your kindness.<br/>
Yes, of course there is a lot of stuff in Tokyo, but mainly in japanese. I got a history class in Jochii, but most of the students are people only interested in fulfill their quota of classes.<br/>
And my major interst in not only study history or see castles... that is very intersting so far, but I would like to talk and do something about it, although if only to share a cup of ocha and having a passionate discussion about swords and chrysanthemums. With english speakers! (well, spanish is to dream too much) I am so tired and dissapointed myself with my nihongo!<br/>
Thank you again.<br/>
