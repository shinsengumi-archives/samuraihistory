<br/>
Since this question comes up about once every 2 months<br/>
or so, here's the canned "Beta" version of the<br/>
response, written by Tony, stealing my examples. :)<br/>
<br/>
"There is no connection with modern "rank" as we know<br/>
it in discussing samurai armies.<br/>
<br/>
The thing is, it is VERY important to divorce the<br/>
concept of terminology of MILITARY rank from samurai<br/>
-- they just don't operate on the same level. There's<br/>
rank, yes, but that's SOCIAL rank, not military rank.<br/>
It's the critical division between HAVING rank (e.g.,<br/>
a duke, a baron, a flunky) and HOLDING rank (e.g., a<br/>
general, a captain, a PFC).<br/>
<br/>
The historical samurai army was a FEUDAL army, not a<br/>
modern one with rank structures in place. As a friend<br/>
of mine [that would be me--lt] once pointed out, you<br/>
don't "join" a samurai army as an "ashigaru 2nd class"<br/>
and work your way up to "1st samurai."<br/>
<br/>
As a feudal structure, the army was vertical;<br/>
authority went up and down within the specific clan or<br/>
alliance affiliation.<br/>
<br/>
The basic "rank" was taisho(which can be translated<br/>
variously as general, lieutenant, captain, commander,<br/>
etc.). Essentially, a taisho commands a body of men.<br/>
Period. It depends on his relationship with others as<br/>
how you define it. For example, on his own, you can<br/>
call Honda Tadakatsu a great general. But in terms of<br/>
his relationship to Tokugawa Ieyasu, he would be<br/>
typically called "one of Ieyasu's best generals," "one<br/>
of Ieyasu's best lieutenants," or "one of Ieyasu's<br/>
best captains." All of those refer to the JOBS<br/>
(generals command, and captains and lieutenants lead<br/>
but serve UNDER someone else), not to ranks.<br/>
<br/>
I think people would generally be surprised at how<br/>
modern the concept of rank-structure in armies is.<br/>
Actually, the Romans were very rank/office set with<br/>
the way they did their legions (the first modern<br/>
armies, afterall), and after them it was centuries<br/>
before anything like it was recreated. I think that it<br/>
might be a factor of the "equality" of a republican<br/>
form of government that created that modern army, as<br/>
it was certainly not a typical feudal structurelike<br/>
that which pervaded Europe from the Normans on, until<br/>
Gustav Adolphus' "new model army" -- and even then it<br/>
was looser than we think of ranks today.<br/>
<br/>
There's no denying that the chef outranks a busboy.<br/>
But neither chef nor busboy are ranks. They are jobs<br/>
and positions. The chef is, however, very important<br/>
and gets to tell people what to do. And busboys are<br/>
low-boy on the totem pole. It's like saying "would you<br/>
agree that the king outranks a knight." Well, duh.<br/>
King and knight aren't "ranks" either, precisely<br/>
speaking, but the relationship of their roles is clear<br/>
enough.<br/>
<br/>
But those aren't ranks. They're JOBS. There's a<br/>
difference, and it's a fairly critical one. Ranks tend<br/>
to have a consistency. A lieutenant always has<br/>
X-number of people under him, a major X-number of<br/>
people, a general X-number and so on. A taisho can<br/>
have 50, 500, or 5,000.<br/>
<br/>
The most basic level of "rank" -- that of kashira or<br/>
taicho -- doesn't even have a specific number of<br/>
troops to be led. It depends on the army makeup. A<br/>
taicho (lit. "group-chief") can have five people or 50<br/>
under him, depending on the job and the specific<br/>
assignment. In modern army terms, that could be<br/>
anything from a squad to a company to a platoon.<br/>
<br/>
And, unlike the modern army, once appointed "ashigaru<br/>
taicho" one could just as quickly be removed from that<br/>
position. While such assignments are social<br/>
promotions, they are not MILITARY promotions like to<br/>
Corporal or Sgt. or Master Sgt, etc.<br/>
<br/>
In any feudally structured army, ALL positions and<br/>
duties are held at the pleasure of the overlord in<br/>
question. There is no way to say "I'm a first<br/>
sergeant, you can't make me a private without due<br/>
cause and a court-martial." Even "permanent"<br/>
appointments (such as that of a taicho) in a Japanese<br/>
army were understood to be continued appointments that<br/>
could be withdrawn at any time (or magnified with<br/>
further postings) and not one's "right" to the<br/>
position.<br/>
<br/>
That's one reason I fight so hard to eliminate the use<br/>
of "ranks" when talking about a feudal Japanese army.<br/>
Or, rather, when the term is used, I try to keep it<br/>
clearly a socio-political reference, or something<br/>
implying that someone HAS (as in "a taisho outranks<br/>
the common footsoldier") but avoid using terms that<br/>
imply a person HOLDS rank."<br/>

<h3>RES: [samuraihistory] ranks</h3>
by <i>tbsorrentino</i>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1401093448">Would you (listmembers, that is) be so kind as to point out if there were<br/>
any formal or constant "jobs" within the japanese feudal military structure?<br/>
Do you know of any "essays" concerning how such "jobs" (or lack thereof)<br/>
affected ancient japanese warfare? Was there relevant differentiation<br/>
between the military system and the "social" system, or was the military<br/>
system "driven by" the social one?<br/>
 <br/>
Would this be off-topic, since the question concerns war related aspects of<br/>
ancient japanese history? <br/>
 <br/>
Thank you.<br/>

clarify what you mean by "ancient Japanese history"? <br/>
<br/>
Too often people completely misuse the word<br/>
"ancient"--there's nothing more "ancient" about Heian<br/>
or Sengoku Japan than there would be about William the<br/>
Conqueror's England or Ivan the Terrible's Russia. <br/>
<br/>
"Ancient" could perhaps apply to something from the<br/>
400-500's AD at the latest. Information about that<br/>
time period is hard to come by, especially detailed<br/>
information. If you mean the "samurai" period--from,<br/>
say, 1000 AD to the 1860's--then "ancient" isn't the<br/>
word you are looking for, but someone may be able to<br/>
find something for you.<br/>

<h3>Re: RES: [samuraihistory] ranks</h3>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-235337167">Hi.<br/>
<br/>
The Japanese middle ages are generally considered to have gone from <br/>
about the time of the Genpei War to about the time of the battle of <br/>
Sekigahara. The Nara and Heian periods are frequently viewed as sort of <br/>
classical and may be viewed as ancient in the context of Japan. <br/>
Anything much earlier than about 700 CE is pretty much pre-historic. <br/>
The stone age ended in Japan sometime around 200 BCE to 200 CE. But, <br/>
Japan remained pretty much pre-literate for sometime afterwards.<br/>
<br/>
It is pretty easy to find out the names and comparative ranks of <br/>
imperial and bakufu offices. These are given in tabular form in an <br/>
appendix to Kodansha Kogojiten. There arealso a few well known <br/>
household officials. There are also the titles held by leaders of the <br/>
ancient clans. Alas, these are not included in the tables that I just <br/>
mentioned.<br/>
<br/>
To complicate things, the Japanese very seldom abandoned any titles or <br/>
offices once they came into use until a general reform of titles during <br/>
the Meiji Restoration in the nineteenth century. Instead, obsolete <br/>
titles and offices generally became ceremonial. In some cases, they <br/>
appear to have become freely assumable.</div>

I am no expert on that aspect of society during that period, but I would suspect that blood and family ties would play more than a small part in this ordering. <br/>

"saburau" which is the anticedent of the term "samurai" shows up during <br/>
the Heian period. More importantly, Wayne Ferris in "Heavenly Warriors" <br/>
argues for a continuity of military development instead of some sort of <br/>
disjuncture between the Heian period and the Kamakura period. Finally, <br/>
in terms of the actual question at hand, you should understand that <br/>
even pre-700 CE titles were still hanging around at the time of the <br/>
Meiji Restoration in 1868. <br/>

<br/>
The word "jidai" simply means "period" and gets stuck after the name of <br/>
the period in question. For example, "Jomon jidai" refers to neolithic <br/>
hunter-gatherer Japan. It is specifically named after a type of <br/>
pottery. In theatre, "jidai" appears as a prefix in "jidaigeki" which <br/>
specifies "period works" (lit. "period theatre") which are of more <br/>
serious or specifically historical intent than "chanbara" type movies <br/>
which are named after, believe it or not, the music that accompanies <br/>
them. So for example, the movie "Shinran" is a jidaigeki. Chanbara are <br/>
sort of costume action adventure films.</div>

<h3>Organization of feudal armies</h3>
by <i>drnostrand</i>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-493368984">Hi.<br/>
<br/>
A general characteristic of feudalism is that armies are organized <br/>
around individuals. Thus, you will see a lot of units being known by <br/>
their commander. In such a system, you will see comparatively little <br/>
systematic organization by military ranks. That is usually a feature of <br/>
non-feudal armies such as the Roman army or modern armies where the <br/>
military is divorced from the land. There is a Japanese drive to form <br/>
"ranks and levels", but this is expressed through a system of <br/>
appointments to office both in several different kinds of institution <br/>
which could and did exist at the same time.<br/>
<br/>
1) The ancient uji offices which by the time you are interested in were <br/>
pretty much ceremonial. These titles are called kabane and there is a <br/>
monograph on them which you can find by a Worldcat search. In the time <br/>
you are probably interested in, these were the cap-ranks of the kuge <br/>
(courtier) class. The number of kabane was changed a couple of times.<br/>
<br/>
2) The the ancient court ranks and offices. These are of interest to <br/>
the samurai and includes the title Sei-i-tai-shougun. All high-ranking <br/>
samurai aspired to court rank and office.<br/>
<br/>
3) The kuge household offices.<br/>
<br/>
4) The offices of the Kamakura bakufu, the Muromachi bakufu, and the <br/>
Tokugawa bakufu. Ones which are of particular interest are jitou and <br/>
the shugo. The jitou were basically local tax collectors and estate <br/>
managers. Their appointment was absorbed by the Kamakura bakufu. The <br/>
shugo were provincial constables whose office roughly paralleled the <br/>
imperial provincial governors. The shuo, and most especially after the <br/>
Onin-Ran evolved into the daimyou which you are probably familiar with <br/>
from the Sengoku period.<br/>
<br/>
5) Buke (samurai) household officials. You frequently see these people <br/>
in movies set in the Edo period.<br/>
<br/>
6) Buddhist temples could and did function as the equivalent of either <br/>
kuge estates or buke fiefdoms. They of course had their own <br/>
administrative structures.<br/>
<br/>
Regardless these different systems co-existed and each of them provided <br/>
revenue streams or "pay grades" for the various people entitled to <br/>
them. According to the war stories, when meeting on the battlefield, <br/>
warriors of high rank would declare their names and various <br/>
entitlements to each other when they believed that their opponent was <br/>
of adequately comparable rank. These declarations are called "nanori". <br/>
This term also refers to one component of the names born by Japanese of <br/>
sufficient rank.</div>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-139124346">Hi.<br/>
<br/>
1) Yes. Medieval Japanese armies were feudal. In general, and Japanese <br/>
feudal armies are not an exception, medieval military units are <br/>
generally known by their unit commanders. You can see this sort of <br/>
thing in the Sekigahara Kasen book which you can purchase at the <br/>
Sekigahara museum. The battle formations are given in terms of their <br/>
commanders and troop strengths. Similarly you will find lists of <br/>
military leaders in terms of troop strengths and incomes. Military men <br/>
could hold a variety of rank bearing offices from a variety of sources <br/>
including: the imperial court, the kuge families, the bakufu, and at <br/>
least later on through the military households. Not to mention those <br/>
who were employed by religious institutions.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> >  There's no denying that the chef outranks a busboy.<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>The word "chef"is etymologically related to "chief" and derives from <br/>
the word for "head". It really is a kind of rank. It is also a job.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> >  A taicho (lit. "group-chief") can have five people or 50<br/>

<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> >  In any feudally structured army, ALL positions and  duties are held <br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Not quite so simple. A medieval unit commander can "own" his unit and <br/>
owe service to his overlord. Medieval commanders did not have quite the <br/>
personnel reassignment capability as that of a modern army. Regardless, <br/>
what was going on in Japan can be quite complex having to do with shiki <br/>
rights, parallel rank and appointment systems, and all sorts of other <br/>
stuff.</div>

 </span></blockquote>Tony. I am perfectly willing to believe you, but it would be nice to <br/>
cite a war tale or some other source so that folks such as myself can <br/>
go look at for themselves. However, from your examples, they sound like <br/>
small unit commanders. Incidentally, unit sizes are not universal even <br/>
in modern and Roman armies. The size of a Roman century was frequently <br/>
something other than 100. Regardless, "taichô" is not in Kodansha <br/>
Kogojiten. Incidentally, the definition for tai in daijirin 1st edition <br/>
suggests that a tai is a fairly small unit capable of unitary movement <br/>
on the battlefield. Interestingly, taichô appears to be a vague term. <br/>
Since people appear to be generally interested in ranks, possibly one <br/>
of the oldest ranks is gochô. The reason I am suggesting this isthat I <br/>
recollect seeing the go in gochô on flags in battle paintings.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Tony there are plenty of perfectly good books out there about <br/>
distinctions in land tenure. You appear to be suggesting that all of <br/>
these were appointive and held from above. I am pointing out that at <br/>
least in some feudal societies there is a distinction between various <br/>
sorts of land tenure. You see these with new fields, permanent <br/>
commendations, &c. If my books weren't off in a storage building, I <br/>
would cite you a specific source on this one, but can not at the <br/>
moment. Finally, taking your unit and switching sides and similar <br/>
independence was a fairly common feature of pre-modern and specifically <br/>
medieval warfare.<br/>
<br/>
Regardless, one of the problems of feudally structured armies is that <br/>
you can not so easily separate Patton from his division or MacArthur <br/>
from his army. Even fairly recently, military units might be raised and <br/>
equipped by their commanders.<br/>
