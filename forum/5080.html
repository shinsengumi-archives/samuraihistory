<h3>15th century battle info</h3>
by <i>M B</i>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1985889919">Hi, My name is Marius and I'm from Norway. I've been lurking here a while <br/>
and learnd alot. Thanks<br/>
<br/>
I'm mostly, or more or less exclusively, interested in japanese history from <br/>
the 14th to 16th century (I'm interesten in the history leading up to that <br/>
too, but thats where most of my interest lie) I think the reason for this is <br/>
that I'm studying Tenshin Shoden Katori Shinto Ryu (which stems from 1447), <br/>
and I'm one of those who thinks the gun ruind the samurai (you all know <br/>
those guys, don't you? ;) )<br/>
<br/>
I'm trying to find info on the Onin war battles... things like what kind of <br/>
armor thay used (difference between upper class, middle class and lower <br/>
class armor), and the battle tactics of the day (formations ect.) and so <br/>
on... so do you guys know of any good books and/or web sites on this time <br/>
span in japanese history which touch on some of or all of these subjects I <br/>
would verry much appreciate it. (I'm also iterested in battle paintings or <br/>
prints from this time frame)<br/>
<br/>
thanks alot! and thanks for a great mailing list.<br/>
<br/>
Marius.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Someone may have already mentioned it, but Varley's<br/>
"The Onin War" is THE source in English. I reread it a<br/>
few months back. <br/>
<br/>
For armor, etc., try Stephen Turnbull's "Samurai<br/>
Warriors". For all of Turnbull's faults, that's a real<br/>
good one as far as showing the particular armor of<br/>
each time period, and how it adapted and evolved.<br/>
Great color prints. <br/>
<br/>
Also for weapons/armor I'd try Bottomley and Hopson's<br/>
"Arms and Armour of the Samurai", as that does a good<br/>
job of showing time periods also. <br/>
<br/>
For tactics, there isn't a whole lot out there for<br/>
this time period--mainly because there wasn't a whole<br/>
lot documented about the actual tactics of the time<br/>
period. Of course, most of the fighting at the<br/>
beginning of the Onin War as house to house street<br/>
fighting in the capital, which doesn't take much<br/>
tactical genius--circle a house, light it on fire, and<br/>
kill the enemy as he comes out seems to be a common<br/>
version. <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1837553328">Thanks alot... and sorry about my delayd respons.<br/>
I've orderd the books now, except "samurai warriors" by Stephen Turnbull I <br/>
could'nt find it anywhere.<br/>
<br/>
I have another question about this time period, did the samurai that fought <br/>
in the Onin war use Sashimono on the battlefield in the later stages the war <br/>
or was it not used at all before the 16th century?<br/>

<h3>Nobunaga administrator</h3>
by <i>mayalan</i>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1269531431">Hi!!<br/>
<br/>
Reading a novel called "Taiko", by Eiji Yoshikawa i read that Nobunaga improved the administration of Mino just after conquering it, of course, it's just a novel, but i wonder, Nobunaga, being as ruthless as he was, what kind of administrator was he?, did Nobunaga implemented better policies in the provinces he conquered?<br/>
