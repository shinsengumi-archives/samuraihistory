<h3>Fires in the Yoshiwara</h3>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1539678677">Hello everyone: <br/>
I haven't posted to this forum in a while but I had a question to which <br/>
I could not find the answer. It deals with the Yoshiwara or pleasure <br/>
quarter of Tokyo. According to historical events the Yoshiwara burnt <br/>
down several times since its creation in the 1600's by the Tokugawa <br/>
regime. I was wondering if anyone knew of a site or had the information <br/>
about the specific timeline of the fires such as months and years. I <br/>
would appreciate it. Thanks to all.<br/>
