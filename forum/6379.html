it could be said that if we're trained to the correct<br/>
sensitivity, any of us can be capable of perceiving things that others, who<br/>
lack that training, may overlook.<br/>

Gereg,<br/>
<br/>
I've followed this thread with no little amount of interest, and wondering <br/>
how I could chime in halfway sensibly, when I came across the part of your <br/>
message I didn't snip out.  Still not sure if I can write in a sensible <br/>
manner, but I'll try.<br/>
<br/>
If I recall correctly, you had early on in your writing alluded to 'the <br/>
artist's eye', and to perceptions that others might miss.   Some people seem <br/>
to have an ability to perceive that is so sensitive as to appear <br/>
'supernatural', or 'mystic'.  Artists, particularly those of Eastern arts, <br/>
including martial,  are taught (or advised) to learn to put aside their own <br/>
ego and absorb their environment, especially in the beginning, of their <br/>
training.  Later on they have learned, or should have learned, to <br/>
incorporate their ego into their perceptions 'properly', and 'become one' <br/>
with the world around them.  Clumsily and said in clichï¿½ form, forgive me, <br/>
but that means to me that the person has become the same ego inside and out, <br/>
and is in a state of 'constant harmony' with their environment....   a place <br/>
in their existence where perception of and response to their environment is <br/>
so well ingrained that the individual appears to have some kind of 'power'.  <br/>
  It's not power; it is 'mushin'.....   at rest,  this concept is <br/>
'zanshin'.............   but this you know already.<br/>
<br/>
As a person who has knit, crocheted, embroidered, and sewn since she was 7 <br/>
years old,  the catalog of impressions my brain has stored about fabrics, <br/>
yarns, and threads is more than I can consciously recall. We in the <br/>
knitter's realm have a concept of yarn 'telling us what it wants to be'  <br/>
such that we say the yarn 'speaks to us'.  Other knitters I know scoff at us <br/>
about 'mysticism', and proceed to knit with yarn obviously unsuited to their <br/>
project and they are wailing and complaining about a 'troublesome project'.  <br/>
They wonder at how others of us can 'make it look so easy'.  I try to <br/>
describe the way I personally 'hear' my yarn or fabric is not in words per <br/>
se, but in a mind-full picture conjured by that store of impressions already <br/>
there.  If the needle size is wrong for the yarn, it will appear to 'fight' <br/>
being knit.<br/>
<br/>
Another person who paints, draws, or writes is tuned to a different store of <br/>
information, as are swordsmiths and all other artisans.   Persons who <br/>
develop several avenues of pursuit get better at amalgamating information <br/>
and perceptions of those arts into a cohesiveness, a 'way' of responding to <br/>
their environment that to others can seem a bit unreal, but it is not.  It <br/>
is simply being and staying aware and responsive to the cues given by one's <br/>
environment.<br/>
<br/>
Health care providers, particularly nurses, also undergo a barrage of <br/>
sensory input that is beyond conscious recall, but some of them can take in <br/>
the appearance of a patient, and the summation of impressions that 'come up <br/>
on screen' 'tells' them that something is not going well.  It's that 'gut' <br/>
feeling.<br/>
<br/>
Soldiers also develop that catalog, unfortunately, with experience in <br/>
battle; Nathan can undoubtedly expound on this subject  much better than I.  <br/>
Some groundwork is certainly laid with intensive training.<br/>
<br/>
What do my previous words have to do with swords that  seem to 'speak'?<br/>
<br/>
I think it has more to do with the person who is handling the sword, than it <br/>
does with the sword itself.  I think it is that awareness, that catalog of <br/>
physical and visual impressions gathered over time, and the ability to allow <br/>
one's mind to create a meaningful picture.<br/>
<br/>
Of course I have a lot more to say,  also about the way a samurai may have <br/>
perceived his blade,  but it mostly enters into the realm of psychology, so <br/>
I won't go there unless there is interest in further discussion.  This is, <br/>
after all, a history list.<br/>
<br/>
Off to work with me....<br/>
