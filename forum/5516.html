I saw it uncut, but I was not that impressed either, but since it was a <br/>
Chinese version without subtitles, I was pretty lost. "Legend of Zu <br/>
Mountain" was similar, great special effects, famous actors, poor plot. <br/>
Sounds like a Lucas film.<br/>

happy after seeing this, you can see the "Twilight Samurai".<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1043535594">I think to much focus is being put on the dialogue and not the <br/>
cinimatography and historical fact. Another croaching tiger hidden <br/>
dragon. But with out the life points.The movie was to focused with <br/>
cable antics and not enough truth.Popular culture will suck it up <br/>
just like the poor remake of the old Zatoichi.Jump around and dance <br/>
through Scenes that would have had a message in the past.I guess I'm <br/>
asking to much. More fact and less 21st century fiction.--- In <br/>
