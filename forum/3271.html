<div id="ygrps-yiv-253484920">Hey all,<br/>
<br/>
  I only know of one non-Japanese individual bestowed with the title of <br/>
"samurai."  His name was Joseph Bass and he trained with Nakayama Hakudo, <br/>
Nakayama Zendo, and Saeki Hijime in Iaido and Kendo.  From what I know he <br/>
was, in essence, knighted by the Japanese government.  This was back in the <br/>
late 50s or early 60s I believe.  He was also given the surname of <br/>
"Hanokami" with his knighting-esque award.  I hope that this made some kind <br/>
of sense and I appologize if anyone finds it hard to believe.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Peace,<br/>
<br/>
Matt<br/>
