I study Kukishinden ryu Bojutsu<br/>
<br/>
The history for this is supposed to stem back to the late 1330's when Kuki<br/>
Yasushimaru was given the name Kuki by Tenno Go Daigo. Or so they say.<br/>
<br/>
Today Kukishin Ryu Bojutsu is also taught in the Hon Tai Yoshin Ryu. As well<br/>
as different branches of the Kukishin Ryu. The mainline of Kukishin Ryu no<br/>
longer studies Martial arts. The Tenshin Hyoho Kukishinden Ryu is connected<br/>
dirrectly to the Kuki family.<br/>
<br/>
In the Bujinkan Dojo Hatsumi sensei has produced a few Bojutsu videos. The<br/>
best being a kata video for the Kukishinden Ryu Bojutsu. This was made by a<br/>
Japanese company. www.ninjutsu.com will sell a copy on NTSC, but if it is a<br/>
pal version you are after I know some one in spain and france who can supply<br/>
original, or maybe I could copy mine for you.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>I beleive Taisen Deshimaru Sensei was writing in the 1950's so all of his<br/>
books<br/>
are readily available in English.<br/>
<br/>
The Katori Shinto Ryu is considered the oldest school of bojutsu, I recommend<br/>
"the Diety and the Sword" by Otake for info on this school and their use of<br/>
the<br/>
Bo. The standard length is usually "roku shaku" or just over six feet.<br/>
<br/>
If you check bujindesign.com or other aikido related sites you may find<br/>
videos<br/>
on bojutsu available.<br/>
