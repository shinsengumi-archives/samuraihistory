       Yeah, it's me, back from an extended stay on the fringe of reality in <br/>
the Netherrealm.<br/>
       I may just be another stupid idiot who has NOT seen The Last Samurai <br/>
(and I don't plan to -- just get me the book), but is it possible that the <br/>
IDEALS of the samurai (i.e. what they stood for, the Bushido, &c.) could still be, <br/>
in a way, very much alive today?  I mean, as a class, certainly, the Samurai <br/>
disappeared a century and a quarter plus ago, sure.  But what they stood for, <br/>
could that not be still around today?  Such as living with honor?<br/>
       I mean, here's an example from another walk of life: In his book <br/>
"Bound By Honor", Bill Bonnano (son of legendary La Cosa Nostra boss Joe Bonnano) <br/>
makes a very real distinction between "A Mafioso" and "mafioso."  The first is <br/>
a "made" member of La Cosa Nostra, what we call the "Mafia" or the "Mob," and <br/>
may or may not be "mafioso."  Mafioso, with a "small" "m", Bonnano describes <br/>
as being about respect and honor, and has nothing to do with gender: "A <br/>
beautiful, proud woman can be said to be mafioso" (introduction, pg xiv).  Bluntly, <br/>
he goes on to describe mafioso as having to do with honor that comes from the <br/>
respect of places: yours and the other person's.  A crime against honor <br/>
(picking on the weak, for example) is not tolerated, and revenge (notice, I did not <br/>
say "justice") is extracted.  (Granted, La Cosa Nostra were, essentially, <br/>
illegal, whilst the Samurai were VERY legal, and this difference is, of course, <br/>
noted.)<br/>
       I may just be another babbling idiot, but does this make any sense at <br/>
all and is this of any value?  Am I at least on the right track?<br/>
       Back to the Netherrealm.  If I don't write again before then, have <br/>
wonderful Christmas seasons, y'hear?  8-)<br/>
