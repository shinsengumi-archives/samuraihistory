<h3>Two ideas...</h3>
by <i>cepooooo</i>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1507539106">I have two ideas:<br/>
<br/>
(1) We start a "become-a-samurai" camp next summer, somewhere in Japan. <br/>
I am dead-serious!!! Let's find a small village in Tohoku, or in <br/>
Kyushu, a couple of serious Japanese sensei to teach martial arts and <br/>
Zen, and a couple of American teachers to lecture on history and let's <br/>
do it!! -- I am all for it! (I am going back to Japan for the summer <br/>
anyway). Sounds like a lot of fun, right ?!!??<br/>
<br/>
(2) Alternatively, I suppose we better send a "FAQ" on "Samurai and <br/>
reality" to all the new subscribers. I mean, "The Last Samurai" has <br/>
been out only THREE days, and...<br/>

The problem here is that the answer to all the questions is either;<br/>
<br/>
1. We cannot help you<br/>
<br/>
or<br/>
<br/>
2. Ask the Yahoo Samurai History list...<br/>
<br/>
Perhaps we can help our very dedicated Webmaster to post some of the <br/>
basics like what is a samurai (bushi), what is (was) Bushido?The <br/>
answers being "read the article on death in the culture section" or <br/>
some such. Clearly we cannot save all the unfortunates out there but, <br/>
"though they be innumerable we must vow to save them all..."<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-351389719">Hmm.. good point - the reason I did that is utility.  I was tired of getting a <br/>
dozen "email me about samurai, thanks" emails a day, and I figured the pikes and <br/>
clubs of the group here would keep the rabble at bay ;)  but adding links to <br/>
specific answers in the FAQ is a very good idea, so I'll try to get to that. Too <br/>
much to do, so little time :(<br/>
So, if anyone wants to come up with a FAQ question+answer or two, PLEASE feel <br/>
free! I am always open to assistance, ideas, and thoughts.<br/>
