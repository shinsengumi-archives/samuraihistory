<h3>Nishina Family</h3>
by <i>acacia753</i>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-303181716">I know having used the research at the Samurai archives site that <br/>
Nishina Morinobu was the 6th son of Takeda Shingen. Does anyone else <br/>
have any information on the Nishina clan? Mon? Other Descendents? It <br/>
is part of my family heritage and I am having great difficulty <br/>
finding anything out. Any help would be appreciated. Please do not <br/>
respond to the above email address. If you wish to respond directly, <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1872653351">I don't know if Morinobu continued on the clan via blood decendants,<br/>
however another clansman, who may not be related by blood, is Nishina<br/>
Moriaki who was active in the 1540's.  Apparently the Nishina clan<br/>
were initially enemies of the Takeda, but eventualy became allied with<br/>
them, or at least fell under thier influence.  That might explain why<br/>
Morinobu was adopted by them.  Thats about all I have on the<br/>
Nishina....  Hope it might help...<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-380638772">Hi,<br/>
<br/>
There is also a Nishina Nobumori who is the 4th son of<br/>
Tekeda shingen.  He died after fortifying hinself in<br/>
his castle of takato.  Oda Nobunaga attacked his<br/>
castle after he refused to surender.  He was killed in<br/>
the attack against takato.  This was around 1582 so at<br/>
least we know the clan survivd that long.  Just in<br/>
case you did not know Nishina Morinobu also died in<br/>
the action at takato castle with his brother.  Man to<br/>
lose both 4th and 5th sons in the same action.  Even<br/>
know takeda shingen was dead at the time I am sure the<br/>
takeda family felt alot of pain that year.<br/>
<br/>
Sorry no info on Mon but they might have used the<br/>
takeda family heraldry....Not sure though.  Doesn't<br/>
look like either one had children of their own.<br/>
<br/>
