<div id="ygrps-yiv-346174350">Between Liz Dalby and several ex-geishas there are some good books on <br/>
modern geisha. The amount of training they go through is amazing, one <br/>
who's book I read started training at age 5 or 6! Now they have to <br/>
finish junior high before they can start training full time. If your <br/>
running a very late Sengoku period scenario you could have onna Kabuki, <br/>
closest you will get to a geisha!<br/>

in traditional dress.<br/>
