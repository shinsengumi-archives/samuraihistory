<h3>Feudalism in Japan?</h3>

<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-803449581">Technically, feudalism implies a series of vertical relationships, <br/>
where one is connected ONLY with the ones directly above and below. <br/>
Thus, I believe in Japan we can talk about feudalism perhaps only in <br/>
the Tokugawa era. The whole Kamakura-Muromachi period was in fact a <br/>
continuous attempt from every part to "cut the middle man."<br/>
<br/>
The ***idealized*** structure should have been something like: <br/>
emperor/court - shogun - daimyo - kokujin - dos√¥ - peasants. As a <br/>
matter of fact, each party tried to do whatever possible for its own <br/>
convenience.<br/>
<br/>
Considering the convulsion of the period, and the fact that there is no <br/>
accepted theory on KK-MM institutional history, I would stay away from <br/>
it. Tokugawa period seems much more approachable, because of the <br/>
Confucian ideology layer, and the police-state that managed more or <br/>
less to control people at least fro two centuries.<br/>

<br/>
Was this not because feudalism found its structure in the late <br/>
Sengoku - and that structure was the Edojidai - or rather <br/>
'Takugawanism'? Until then we see a constant striving towards <br/>
that 'ideal' interruptd by the incursions of one's neighbours, but it <br/>
was there.<br/>
<br/>
Tokugawa feudalism was not a product of Ieyasu, it was an <br/>
incipient feudalism instituted on a national scale; both Hideyoshi <br/>
and Nobunaga were working towards that end with themselves <br/>
at the top of the tree - and every daimyo instituted and <br/>
maintained a feudal regime as much as he was able.<br/>
