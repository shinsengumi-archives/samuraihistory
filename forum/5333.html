<h3>Japanese Language-For Eddy</h3>
by <i>scott_rekishika</i>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1842860515">Ahhhh, a young teenager bitten by "the bug" brings back memories for<br/>
me, and I am sure many others on this list.  I was bitten by the bug<br/>
at such a young age I cannot remember.  Always been interested in<br/>
Japan as far back as I can remember, but didnt start really reading<br/>
about it till my teen years.  Just to try to give you some help.  I<br/>
don't know if you have found it, but www.japanshoten.com offers a<br/>
number of books to help you with Japanese.  I plan to get several of<br/>
them when I get the money to help suplement my classes at college.  My<br/>
teachers use a series call Yookoso.  The author escapes me at the<br/>
moment , and I dont have my copy in front of me.  However, it is<br/>
available through amazon.com.  It does have it's own flaws, and a<br/>
number of people I know that have been to Japan do not like it very<br/>
much because of it's style.  But, it is better then nothing and they<br/>
come with either tapes or cd's.  Another good recourse from what I<br/>
hear are the Genki series.  These can be found on japanshoten.com as<br/>
well as other places.  A Japanese friend of mine tell me that this is<br/>
what many Japnese universities use to teach Japanese to their<br/>
"exchange" students from other countries.  Hope this helps you out<br/>
some, and keep up the study.... just be carefull of where you learn<br/>
from.  I am not saying this is you, but, too many kids in my Japanese<br/>
I class have tried to learn Japanese through anime....scary and the<br/>
teachers don't appreciate hearing "but in _____ anime they said<br/>
'______' and the subtitles said '____' so they must be right". *Hides<br/>
under the covers* scary otaku, scary otaku *lol*.  I wish you the best<br/>
of luck.</div>
