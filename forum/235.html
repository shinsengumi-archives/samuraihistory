<div id="ygrps-yiv-1250361824">Hello,<br/>
<br/>
The ninja straight sword is a myth.  They used some<br/>
interesting tools but for the most part their entire<br/>
legend is movie myth.<br/>
<br/>
Steven turnbull wrote a hard to get book called the<br/>
ninja that sets out all the myth and seperates it from<br/>
the truth.<br/>
<br/>
The ninja were called shinobi among other things and<br/>
it is believed that this idea came from sun tzu among<br/>
other old chinese sources.  Usually the "ninja" were<br/>
guys that would sneak in to a castle and set fire or<br/>
cause confusion in an enemy camp.<br/>
<br/>
There is more but you can get the bokk by ordering<br/>
from amazon.uk<br/>

<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1515345445">I think that if you search the forums such as E-Budo you will find the <br/>
answers in more depth there, anyway...<br/>
 As far as I (or most people) know, the Ninja-To (straight blade) was first <br/>
used in the 1980's as a gimmick by people who were caught up in the <br/>
'Ninja-boom'. These weapons are not proven 'Ninja' tools, indeed why would <br/>
any spy wish to advertise his position as obviously as wearing a straight and <br/>
shorter blade? Their use by ninja is probably as real as their "as used by <br/>
Hattori Hanzo" stickers and labels.<br/>
 Sensei Hatsumi says in his book that the Ninja families had made their own <br/>
blades due to the costs of getting Katana, and this is believable at <br/>
least..These swords may have been shorter, or had larger, square, Tsuba <br/>
(guards) but the Katana/Tachi shape of sword has been proven to be far more <br/>
effective than a straight bladed weapon in the way the Katana was used and <br/>
the Ninja families would probably have kept the basic shape similar.<br/>
 Sensei Tanemura's book "Ninpo secrets" has an photograph of what he calls a <br/>
'Ninja-to" but it is a curved sword, similar to a Wakizashi in length and <br/>
with concealed pockets on the Saya for 'metsubishi' powders or to brath <br/>
through underwater.<br/>
 As I said, none of this can be proven but check around and generally I think <br/>
most people see the Ninja-to as a bit of joke. (ala Teenage mutant ninja <br/>
Turtles et al..)<br/>
 The debate continues......</div>

<h3>Re: [samuraihistory] The origins of the Ninja straight sword.</h3>

<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1995183936">In regard to the ninja straight sword, something I would like to add to<br/>
this discussion may shed some light on the subject. I couldn't say<br/>
specifically or without doubt that ninja did or did not use some different<br/>
sort of weapon.<br/>
    What I CAN say, though, is that ninja, if you consider them with some<br/>
modicum of common sense, were samurai. The "Ninjitsu" art is very skilled<br/>
and shows traces of the higher teachings of other martial arts belonging to<br/>
families of very high social status, including the Imperial family.<br/>
    Arts such as these were not taught to the common soldier. More<br/>
specifically, they were rarely, if ever, taught to people outside the family<br/>
or clan. The ninja arts you see on the hyped up television shows are more<br/>
like karate, an art developed by peasants. The actual art of ninjitsu is<br/>
MUCH different. It is more like jujutsu, involving joint locks, pressure<br/>
points, balance breaking, and all the other fundamental principles of the<br/>
secret arts of the samurai clans.<br/>
    What you must consider here is that ninja were not assassins sent to<br/>
murder the common folk. Soldiers would have done just fine for that task.<br/>
Ninja were assassins designated for murdering members of the higher social<br/>
status.<br/>
    Send an ill-trained man to take out someone like Oda Nobunaga, Ieyesu<br/>
Tokugawa, Shingen Takeda, etc, and what you would likely end up with is a<br/>
botched assassination. Yes, it's true that any man can be gotten to, but men<br/>
of such stature were not so easy to kill, and only a fool would send a lacky<br/>
for such an important task knowing that if he failed, the blame might come<br/>
back on him. Japanese bravery or not, torture can motivate a lot of people.<br/>
    Therefore, it is my educated guess that ninja had to be of at least<br/>
samurai status in order to have the training necessary to lay low someone so<br/>
well trained in the martial arts as the people they were sent to<br/>
assassinate. If they are samurai, then it is not likely they used anything<br/>
different than the typical samurai katana.<br/>
    IF they used something different, it would have been for some sort of<br/>
practical purpose, like ease of movement, or the ability to move unhindered<br/>
in tight quarters. After all, they did not walk up to the front door and<br/>
announce that they were there to assassinate someone, and I imagine it would<br/>
have been cumbersome trying to scale a castle wall in the fancy samurai garb<br/>
and protruding katana at the hip. A shoulder harness would have been<br/>
appropriate for such tasks, and a curved katana blade would have been more<br/>
difficult to draw from such a position.<br/>
    Sooo, although I am of the opinion that the ninja did not carry straight<br/>
swords, I can see the practicality in it given their task and the<br/>
circumstances surrounding the completion of it. The curved katana might have<br/>
been a better weapon, but the ninja did not intend to pitch battle. They<br/>
intended a sword in the back.<br/>
    This, of course, is all just opinion and conjecture, but as with most<br/>
things, if you take a look at the root of something, a lot of truths come to<br/>
the surface.<br/>

200 - 300 years ago.  I'm sure that judo or jujitsu-like 'wrestling' <br/>

(and thus on what I 'haven't' come accross) that mass training for <br/>

 </span></blockquote>You'd be surprised. There is an old martial art (the name of which escapes<br/>
me for the moment) which is, essentially, "wrestling in armour."<br/>
<br/>
It's a very practical thing to learn to do, if you're an armoured warrior<br/>
who periodically has to fight in close quarters. You learn how to grab and<br/>
secure people wearing armour (where to grab, etc.) and how to avoid being<br/>
grabbed while in armour.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1513236713">Mr. Bryant -<br/>
Still on the subject of 'samurai bootcamp', I was wondering if you <br/>
might have come accross anything in your research regarding samurai <br/>
training - if there were any standards, training sessions, etc.  I <br/>
recall that Nobunaga 'played war' with his men in the fields, which <br/>
apparently prepared them for okehazama - but did any lords have any <br/>
sort of 'training regiment'?  <br/>

For one think, the sumo mawashi isn't an obi per se. And little in armour<br/>
grappling depends on the shiroobi, which is hard to get a hold of (it's<br/>
tight).<br/>

It's like saying football is a development of baseball because they both<br/>

Is judo a development of sumo? They're both wrestling. Is Greco-Roman<br/>

by <i>Alexander M. Frazier</i>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1729277717">This much I know ...<br/>
    There were two schools that taught martial arts that I know of, the<br/>
information passed down through verbal transmission in the Takeda line. Aizu<br/>
had a school that taught Oshikiuchi, a weaponless martial art, and the other<br/>
was, I THINK, Onaha Itto-ryu. These schools were very prized, and they<br/>
taught to all the high ranking members of the Aizu and Takeda clans; the<br/>
dignitaries and political members specifically.<br/>
    In direct regard to "martial arts training", Judo is an offspring of<br/>
Daito-ryu. Although it is powerful in and of itself, it's initial creation<br/>
was through a student of Daito-ryu, and all the original "advertisement" so<br/>
to speak, was a display of Daito-ryu by Shiro Tanomo, son of Saigo Tanomo.<br/>
    Certain members of the higher ranking samurai, like Shingen Takeda, not<br/>
only learned their heritage art passed down through the family, but they<br/>
started at eight years old. The Daito-ryu art in particular, which is the<br/>
one Shingen would have studied through his youth and young adulthood, has<br/>
been in existence as far back as 1200 AD, formalized by Minamoto Yoshimitsu.<br/>
The original form included some weapon study, but it was still a form of<br/>
jujutsu, and jujutsu happens to be one of the most potent and deadly arts in<br/>
the history of the world. Just watch The Ultimate Fighting Championships if<br/>
you doubt that. :oP<br/>
    As far as high ranking members of the Samurai tradition hiring martial<br/>
artists to teach them ... Tokugawa did just that. In the 1640s(?), following<br/>
his amnesty, Tokugawa sought out the remnants of the Takeda clan to train<br/>
his personal body guards.<br/>
    The majority of this information is complements of Kondo Sensei. These<br/>
are his oral trasmissions as best as I know them, passed down from the<br/>
direct Takeda line.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-754791451">Hi All,<br/>
<br/>
Went home and looked at what resources I have desk-side.<br/>
<br/>
As mentioned in my previous post, Hideyoshi did indeed study under the <br/>
Chikurin style of archery.  What is more, so did Nobunaga and Hidetsugu.<br/>
<br/>
Still did not find much in the way of information about samurai practising <br/>
unarmed combat, except for the following short mention by John Rogers:<br/>
<br/>
p. 416 "Most of the martial traditions of the [late Muromachi] period were <br/>
composite arts that taught the use of a number of bladed weapons as wells as <br/>
armed and unarmed combat."<br/>
<br/>
"Arts of War in Times of Peace" _Monumenta Nipponica_, Vol. 45, no. 4<br/>
<br/>
Another interesting article is by Hurst and may (for some) be a little more <br/>
accessible than his book:<br/>
<br/>
"Ryuha in the Martial and Other Japanese Arts". _Journal of Asian Martial <br/>
Arts_, Vol. 4, no. 4, 1995.<br/>
<br/>
This article likely is like an abstract of the information on ryuha in the <br/>
book (_Armed Martial Arts of Japan_), and is good supplementary info if a <br/>
bit off-thread.<br/>
<br/>
Cheers,<br/>
<br/>

<h3>Re: Samurai bootcamp</h3>
by <i>tom.davidson@realtime.co.uk</i>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1403458155">I have been following this thread with interest and wondering <br/>
whether training etc. was a lot more 'organic' rather than <br/>
organised. Presumably dad (or uncle, or someone in the family <br/>
group) would take it upon themselves to teach junior how to <br/>
hold a sword properly, how to do this, how to do that . . . the <br/>
same applies to the bow, horse-riding, etc. Surely in military <br/>
households boys would have learned this the same as how to <br/>
dress themselves.<br/>
<br/>
Similarly, although we look at maps of old battles showing the<br/>
dispositions of various lords and clans, the model might have <br/>
been closer to the Scottish clans (my own heritage) who<br/>
just turned up on the day with the boys and were told to 'stand <br/>
there - go when I say' rather than forming an organised army as <br/>
we understand it. (My family got effectively wiped out when one <br/>
of our confederation clans pulled out of the battle moments <br/>
before it began because they were refused the 'place of honour' <br/>
in the line!)<br/>
<br/>
The skill of the major daimyo must have been organisational as <br/>
well as military, in raising and managing large armies. Even at <br/>
the last Osaka battle was there not confusion when one unit <br/>
moved causing another to cry 'treachery', and wasn't someone<br/>
unwilling to move because he hadn't finished breakfast? This <br/>
suggests a lot more of a confederation of allies liable to do <br/>
their own thing rather than, say, a Napoleonic Grande Armee.<br/>
<br/>
Also, daimyo being the tin-pot dictators a lot of them probably <br/>
were, I can well see them calling the troops out on a Sunday <br/>
morning and marching them up and down - perhaps if one thinks <br/>
of the local militia units raised by the 'lord of the manor'?<br/>
<br/>
I think that the Dojo and Ryu we have today was always a rather <br/>
on the esoteric side of things - the exception rather than the <br/>
rule? Masters opened schools and took students, yes, but not as <br/>
part of a cohesive daimyo training programme. Also, presumably, <br/>
skilled warriors on their travels would stop off and avail <br/>
themselves of local hospitality in exchange for a few tips?<br/>
<br/>
In the Hagakure there's that bit where the young lord is taken <br/>
to the execution grounds to test his cutting skills . . . <br/>
presumably again by dad or someone?<br/>
<br/>
We might well ask where the mafia learn all their skills? I <br/>
doubt there's some secret training school in Sicily - more <br/>
likely within the family, and by trail and error, and luck.<br/>
<br/>
Just some thoughts for the mix<br/>
