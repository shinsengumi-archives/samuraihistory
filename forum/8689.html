<div id="ygrps-yiv-1603081077">Very interesting stories. I look forward to next year's contest. <br/>
<br/>
By the way, I know that I had a few mis-spellings and typos in my story,<br/>
"The Faithful." Would it be all right to submit an edited version (I<br/>
won't change the story itself) for posting on the site?<br/>
<br/>
Thanks, Nina Boal <br/>
