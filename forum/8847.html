<h3>Samurai Board Games....</h3>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1850160108">forgive me if this sounds like an advert, but I just found a great<br/>
site that is offering two great samurai games that have only been<br/>
available in Japan for twenty years.<br/>
<br/>
The games (only w/ japanese instructions before) are now being<br/>
released (in pre-orders currently) by Multiman Publishing with<br/>
english rules for the first time. It takes 500+ pre-orders before<br/>
they start shipping (similar to GMT games).<br/>
<br/>
The games are "Samurai Lords, the Wars of Feudal Japan," and "A Most<br/>
Dangerous Time, Japan 1570-1584."<br/>

<br/>
I have read reviews of both japanese versions and they sound great.<br/>
I hope that this post will encourage others to order one or both of<br/>
the games (so I can get mine sooner!).<br/>
<br/>
Enjoy!<br/>

PS. If anyone here has played these games before, please give us<br/>
your thoughts.</div>
