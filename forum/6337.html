In 1704, Lord Tokudaiji and his army face certain death against the <br/>
hordes of Chinese warlord Hsiao. Samurai Asukai Shiro spends the <br/>
last night before the battle with his lover Yoshiko. He promises <br/>
her, no matter what, he will allow "nothing in heaven or on earth to <br/>
come between us". The next day, Tokudaiji and his men fight to their <br/>
deaths. Asukai survives when he's buried in rubble from the castle. <br/>
He learns that Hsiao kidnapped Lady Yoshiko. Before he can join his <br/>
lord and comrades in death, he must fulfill the vow he made to his <br/>
love.<br/>
<br/>
This looks and feels like a CrossGen comic. Not only does Marz <br/>
write `Samurai' in a style similar to CrossGen's `Scion', but <br/>
colorist Jason Keith was also `Scion's colorist. Add to that Luke <br/>
Ross' art looking almost exactly like Greg Land's (who provides the <br/>
cover), and I'd swear this was an unpublished CrossGen comic.<br/>
<br/>
`Samurai: Heaven and Earth' has a samurai that puts his love ahead <br/>
of his honor. I've often seen samurai portrayed as intense warriors <br/>
who value their code of honor more than anyone's life, including <br/>
their own. It's refreshing to see a samurai portrayed as a lover <br/>
instead of a fighter. It's his love for Yoshiko that drives Asukai <br/>
to fight, rather than loyalty to his lord and country. <br/>
<br/>
According to the text piece at the end of the issue, Asukai's quest <br/>
for Yoshiko takes him through Europe. Why is a Japanese samurai <br/>
searching for a Chinese warlord in Europe? I don't know. That should <br/>
be revealed in future issues. And since there's no sign of this trip <br/>
in this issue, nor does any character appear in Europe, I give this <br/>
book 4 bullets instead of 5. I think that's an important element of <br/>
the story and should have been included in the opening chapter.<br/>
<br/>
As it stands, this is a fine comic. It's well worth your money and <br/>
your time. And I'm not just saying that because Ron Marz sent it to <br/>
me for free. If you like samurai stories, quests for lost loves, or <br/>
penciled art from Brazilians, you'll like this book.</div>
