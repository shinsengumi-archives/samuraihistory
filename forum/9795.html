<div id="ygrps-yiv-292744328">I would like to be sent all reports, articles, and other information about mitsuhide akechi. The samurai have always been of great interest to me down to there unique fighting styles, there code of living (Bushido), and there everyday culture. But this samurai has always stood above all others in the things he done i would like to know as much as possible about him. So help would be appreciated.<br/>

Just out of interest, I was wondering what it is that sets (in your opinion) Akechi above his contemporaries? <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1012444746">I'm interested to that response... Of course, Akechi Mitsuhide was an interesting fellow for a number of reasons, but the reference to bushido and samurai fighting styles makes me wonder. Mitsuhide was one of the last people I'd be association with a code of honor. <br/>
<br/>
Having said that... The Lamers biography on Oda Nobunaga (Japonius Tyrannus) is an excellent English-language resource that has a good deal of information about Akechi Mitsuhide, although much is related directly to his relationship with Nobunaga himself. I would also suspect that the accounts of the Portuguese missionaries like Frois (Historia de Japam) and Rodriguez (varoius sources) might have information in them too if you can get a translation. Otherwise, just check the Samurai Archives using the link below.<br/>
