It is by no means complete, but is a good solid start. Due to <br/>
logistical problems over the next few months I don't expect to add to <br/>
it until a much later date, but enjoy!<br/>

I'd love to see a bit more on the ritsuryou system in general - my <br/>
current fetish - and where the titles came from to begin with, there <br/>

to pull together what you have there.<br/>

    I just didn't know it had existed. That post I didn't open, but have now <br/>
seen it.  The least I can say is "impressive.  Very impressive."  L8r.<br/>
