<h3>Most Admirable Samurai and also about Nobunaga</h3>

<br/>
The one who did a real admirable work on this subject was Takeda Shingen!<br/>
One of the most admirable persons in the Japan History! Tokugawa did the<br/>
unifying of Japan because his incursions had peace as a goal, unlike the<br/>
christian Nobunaga, that only spread terrorism and genocide.<br/>
<br/>
And yes, I admire him as well Musashi. Of course I am speaking about<br/>
Takeda...<br/>
<br/>
Btw, that statements (babbling in japanese) about Musashi being not fammous<br/>
to real japan dwellers is ridiculous. Sorry if I offend anyone, but I have<br/>
some basis to call the attention of all.<br/>
<br/>
First of all, his book Go Rin No Shou is obrigatory reading to several japan<br/>
executive staff people.<br/>
<br/>
Second, There was a Japanese TV Series Drama about Miyamoto Musashi's<br/>
biography and it was very popular in Japan.<br/>
<br/>
Third, there was TONS of manga and gekiga that was in homnage of Musashi,<br/>
mentioned him somewhere or used a version of him like an popular comic manga<br/>
of the 80s that had a kind of Musashi-Kid as its principal character.<br/>
<br/>
I remember a joke very well inside such manga...<br/>
<br/>
There was a duel between musashi-kid and another little samurai about who<br/>
would be a better samurai.<br/>
<br/>
Musashi glared to him and he glared to Musashi, and no one lost this face<br/>
down. Then the little samurai told Musashi this:<br/>
<br/>
"Bushido's way is to not be afraid of Death, in fact is to live in death",<br/>
then suddendly he killed himself in front of Musashi just to prove him that<br/>
he is better than Musashi.<br/>
<br/>
With tears on his face, Musashi said that this is correct, but NOT NECESSARY<br/>
in this WAY!!!<br/>
<br/>
(this was supposed to be a joke in such a dark humour typical of such comics<br/>
serie and of course, was not published in english)<br/>
<br/>
Also, I've heard about Musashi much time before all this NIPON-Modism, and<br/>
it was around the 80's as well!<br/>

No,Tokugawa and Hideyoshi would never have ended like they did.If Nobunaga<br/>
didn't take all that territory,Hideyoshi would have never been to<br/>
Korea.....and perhaps the Tokugawa dinasty would't have existed....<br/>

  Anyways, would Hideiyoshi and Tokugawa have gotten that far without<br/>
  Nobunaga´s incursions? Specially Tokuwaga, who seemed to be at the right<br/>
  time, at the right place? Whilst I do not intend to set myself as an<br/>

Nobunaga was not Christian at all. He had Christian "friends" because <br/>
they helped him to get fire-weapons, and because he really hated <br/>
organized Buddhism, especially the Ikki's. Bur Christian, he was not.<br/>
<br/>
Regarding him being a terrorist and genocidal, I tend to disagree as <br/>
well. His war techniques had not much ado with terrorism, and -while he <br/>
killed many innocent, as most generals- it doesn't seem to me that he <br/>
was concerned with the destruction of any specific group.<br/>
<br/>
And Hideyoshi was so obsessed with war that once Japan was at peace, he <br/>
attacked Korea.<br/>
<br/>
Besides that, what are your basis on which judging a man who lived <br/>
centuries ago in a country engulfed in a civil war? He and Shingen were <br/>
warriors, and did what warriors do. They fought to win, I order to <br/>
obtain power.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1687235954">Exactly, "genocide" is the eradication (full or partial) of a race of people, be it the Jews in Europe (a series of pogroms which tragically dates back to the 11th Century in England, as a precursor to Crusades or responses to crises) or the clinically-entitled "ethnic-cleansing of the former Yugoslav Republics or such crisis-ridden countries as Rwanda. Oda Nobunaga undertook no such actions. He eradicated threats, admittedly ruthlessly and with little consideration for the status of those he deemed to be threats. Of course women and children were casualties, which is never right, but simply the way it was, and still is. <br/>
He held little regard for Buddhism, shown by his allegedly debaucherous formative years and lack of respect shown at his father's funeral, but he was no Christian hoping to destroy Buddhism, but only to destroy those who stood in his way. This may have lead to large loss of life but this wasn't genocide, and it struck terror into his opponents but was not what we now call terrorism. <br/>
The meas suited the objective, an objective that is hard to sum up in much of the language we are so used to today.<br/>

First,don't call me mr. Alexander.Call me Edy because I'm nearly 13 years old.I admire very much Takeda Shingen.He is one of the most important persons in Japanese history.He was the first to build a dam on a river in Kozuke(I think) or something like that.He was an excellent commander,had excellent generals under his command,ex. Kosaka Masanobu,Yamamoto Kansuke,Itagaki Nobutaka(he did an excellent thing with Shingen,I'll explain in a mail) and many other........The part with excellent commanding is the 4th battle of Kawanakajima where he defeated the great Dragon of Echigo(Uesugi Kenshin)....Too bad that Takeda Katsuyori(his son,he was born by lady Suwa)wasn't such a good commander like him.If he was,he could have defeated Tokugawa and Oda and bring back the peace with the Takeda clan rulling all over Japan.<br/>

<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-259996786">Again, I do not claim mastership over Ancient Japanese History, however, stating that Tokugawa had peace as a goal doesn´t seem accurate enough. Unless, of course, peace is defined as the absence of opposition, by which any warlord and any warmonger may be shielded by the flag of peace. I can´t recall to whom it is ascribed, but a very interesting quotation sums it up: "diplomacy is the art of saying ´nice doggie, nice doggie´ until one finds a stick big enough".<br/>
<br/>
I believe one of the most important conclusions we can harness from the Nobunaga-Akechi incident concerns the value of loyalty. It doesn´t matter how powerful and accomplished an enitity is, for the lack of loyal retainers may cause the collapse of any structure.<br/>
<br/>
I tend to agree with Edy pertaining to the outcome of the Sengoku Jidai. Both Hideiyoshi´s and Tokugawa´s achievements laid heavily on the road paved by Nobunaga.<br/>
<br/>
Also, it is important to note that the Tokugawa clan was not above employing social control measures in order to maintain power. The class restrictions and the creation of a "political police" (like the shinsengummi) are examples of that.<br/>

  There was a duel between musashi-kid and another little samurai about who<br/>
  would be a better samurai.<br/>
<br/>
  Musashi glared to him and he glared to Musashi, and no one lost this face<br/>
  down. Then the little samurai told Musashi this:<br/>
<br/>
  "Bushido's way is to not be afraid of Death, in fact is to live in death",<br/>
  then suddendly he killed himself in front of Musashi just to prove him that<br/>
  he is better than Musashi.<br/>
<br/>
  With tears on his face, Musashi said that this is correct, but NOT NECESSARY<br/>
  in this WAY!!!<br/>
<br/>
  (this was supposed to be a joke in such a dark humour typical of such comics<br/>
  serie and of course, was not published in english)<br/>
<br/>
  Also, I've heard about Musashi much time before all this NIPON-Modism, and<br/>
  it was around the 80's as well!<br/>

  No,Tokugawa and Hideyoshi would never have ended like they did.If Nobunaga<br/>
  didn't take all that territory,Hideyoshi would have never been to<br/>
  Korea.....and perhaps the Tokugawa dinasty would't have existed....<br/>

    Anyways, would Hideiyoshi and Tokugawa have gotten that far without<br/>
    Nobunaga´s incursions? Specially Tokuwaga, who seemed to be at the right<br/>
    time, at the right place? Whilst I do not intend to set myself as an<br/>
  expert<br/>
    on the field (an enthusiast, rather - please bear this in mind), would it<br/>
  be<br/>
    too far from feasible bounds to hold that Tokugawa won by default (lack of<br/>
    capable opponents)?<br/>

	I hope you will recall that what was said was "most Japanese would not <br/>
mention Musashi as the most famous 'samurai'" I think this is very <br/>
true, If you said swordsman or martial artist then of course Musashi <br/>
would be first....<br/>
