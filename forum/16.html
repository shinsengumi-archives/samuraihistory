Saw this on the Samurai History list about your work on Tokugawa ships etc.<br/>
<br/>
I study Kukishinden Ryu, which is a branch of the Kukishin ryu of the Kuki<br/>
family from Ayabe (Tanabe & Settsu) - bit of a mouthful.<br/>
<br/>
I have some limited information and am looking for more on the shuips used by<br/>
the Kuki who are supposed ot have been admirals of the fleets belonging to<br/>
Oda, Hideyoshi (involved heavily for him in Korea), and some work with the<br/>
Tokugawa. They are even believed to have saild 6 Iron clad ships against the<br/>
Mori in a sea battle in the Bay of Osaka or Kobe.<br/>
<br/>
By chance have you anything further than what Turnbull worte about them in his<br/>
book Samurai Warfare<br/>
<br/>
best wishes<br/>

<h3>[Re: [samuraihistory] Samurai Stories</h3>

<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1696026849">Probably the two most obvious choices would be 'Taiko' and 'Musashi' <br/>
by Eiji Yoshikawa - the former a fictionalization of the life of <br/>
Toyotomi Hideyoshi, and the latter a fictionalization of the life of <br/>
Miyamoto Musashi.  I'm sure others on the list can come up with <br/>
more.  Otherwise, I myself have translated the beginings of two <br/>
stories, one on the life of Takeda Shingen: <br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.techjapanese.com/samurai/shingent2.html">http://www.techjapanese.com/samurai/shingent2.html</a> and one one the <br/>

<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.techjapanese.com/samurai/hideyoshit1.html">http://www.techjapanese.com/samurai/hideyoshit1.html</a>  The <br/>
translations are pretty much strait translations, I really didnt edit <br/>
them, just pretty much went word for word into english, so some of <br/>
the sentences might be a bit awkward...  Anyway, time permitting I'll <br/>
add to them.<br/>

<h3>RE: [Re: [samuraihistory] ships]</h3>
by <i>Garvey, Paul</i>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1674748608">I can suggest a series of mystery novels set in seventeenth-century Japan.<br/>
The author is Laura Joh Rowland. Her novels include SHINJU(1994),<br/>
BUNDORI(1996), THE WAY OF THE TRAITOR (1997), THE CONCUBINE'S TATTOO(1998)<br/>
and the most recent THE SAMURAI'S WIFE (2000). All feature the Samurai<br/>
detective Sano Ichiro.<br/>
<br/>
Along the same vein as THE NAME OF THE ROSE by Umberto Eco.<br/>
<br/>
Hope this helps...Paul<br/>

What do you have on the Japanese naval side of the Korea campaign ? I am<br/>
very interested in that campaign and have dug up a fair amount on the land<br/>
action from both sides and also quite a lot on the naval campaign, but only<br/>
from Korean point of view.<br/>

<br/>
Get a copy of "The Signore" by Tsuji Kunio (it's in translation and is available <br/>
from Kodansha International, and is paperback. It purports to be a letter <br/>
"home" by an Italian adventurer in the suite of Fr. Organtino, who gets involved <br/>
with Nobunaga ('the signore') who is never actually named. It was an award-<br/>
winnning novel in Japan, and predated Shogun by several years as a "European <br/>
in Japan" story. <br/>
<br/>
If you want some good samurai fiction, why not read some originals, like "The <br/>
Tale of the Heike"? There are a few good translations out there.<br/>
