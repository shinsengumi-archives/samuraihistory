<h3>Sengoku/Japanese history Scholarship</h3>

<h3>Re: [samuraihistory] Sengoku/Japanese history Scholarship</h3>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1031906986">Hi,<br/>
<br/>
I am currently working on an MA and am doing research on buke kakun "warrior <br/>
house codes", and am specifically doing a translation of one from the late <br/>
15th century.  I am enrolled in a program that is officially a "language and <br/>
literatures" department and therefore did not have the benefit of a set <br/>
course of classes from which to be guided in terms of history books.  I can, <br/>
however, share the books that I was directed to by my advisor...<br/>
<br/>
Initially, I did look at the older stuff (Sansom, et. al.)  While his <br/>
perspective may be rightly characterized as outdated, and his choice of what <br/>
things (people, events) to include/emphasize a bit suspect, still I find the <br/>
Sansom books invaluable as the indexes are extensive and the bibliographies <br/>
superb.  I usually go there first when heading off on new subjects.<br/>
<br/>
For Kamakura stuff it is pretty much a Mass world.  The late Jeffrey Mass, <br/>
formerly professor at Stanford, wrote the book(s) on Western scholarship of <br/>
medieval Japan.  Not only are _his_ books great, but most of the leading <br/>
American scholars currently working on medieval Japan are his former <br/>
students (Karl Friday, Thomas Conlan, Alex Bay, etc.)  I must say that most <br/>
of the books authored or edited by Mass have to do with political <br/>
institutions and are not really of the military history genre, but much in <br/>
the same way as Turnbull has monopolized the warring states period, Mass <br/>
(and the Mass-ites) are pretty much the only game in town when it comes to <br/>
medieval stuff.  Anyway, here are a few books that I have used in my <br/>
research.<br/>
<br/>
Mass:<br/>
   Kamakura Bakufu: A Study in Documents<br/>
   Medieval Japan<br/>
   Court and Bakufu in Japan<br/>
   Antiquity and Anachronism in Japanese History<br/>
   The Bakufu in Japanese History<br/>
   The Origins of Japan's Medieval World: Courtiers, Clerics, Warriors and <br/>
ZPeasants in the Fourteenth Century<br/>
   Warrior Government in Early Medieval Japan<br/>
   Lordship and Inheritance in Early Medieval Japan<br/>
   The Dev't of Kamakura Rule<br/>
<br/>
Others:<br/>
   G. Cameron Hurst - The Armed Martial Arts of Japan<br/>
   G. Cameron Hurst - Insei - Abdicated Sovereigns<br/>
   William Wayne Farris - Heavenly Warriors<br/>
   Karl Friday - Hired Swords<br/>
   Kenneth Grossberg - Japan's Renaissance - The Politics of the Muromachi <br/>
Bakufu<br/>
   Ikegami - The Taming of the Samurai<br/>
   Hiroaki Sato - Legends of the Samurai<br/>
   George Perkins - The Clear Mirror<br/>
   John Brownlee - Japanese Historians and the National Myths<br/>
   Martin Colcutt - Five Mountains<br/>
   Marius Jansen - Warrior Rule in Japan<br/>
   George Elison (now Jurgas Elisonas...hi A.J.) Warlords, Artists and <br/>
Commoners: Japan in the 16th century<br/>
<br/>
These are just a few off the top of my head and many major works are <br/>
probably not represented.  It should also be noted that a lot of what gets <br/>
read (even at the MA level) is not in the form of monographs.  Lots of the <br/>
current research is actually presented as journal articles (Monumenta <br/>
Nipponica, Harvard Journal of Asian Studies, etc.) as well as Ph.D theses.  <br/>
Most of this research eventually makes it to books, but it is usually a <br/>
while in the offing.  For those in the States, most of the large state <br/>
universities (land grant-types) have these journals on-hand or at least can <br/>
get you what you need.<br/>
<br/>
I am not sure, but would think that anyone doing research on Japan (at least <br/>
pre-modern) would be required to read in Japanese at the graduate level.  As <br/>
undergraduates it is unlikely, however except in exceptional cases.<br/>
<br/>
Hope this is what you were looking for.<br/>

The Nature of Warfare in Fourteenth-Century Japan: <br/>
The Record of Nomoto Tomoyuki<br/>
<br/>
Although the "rise" of warriors in Japanese history has generated <br/>
considerable scholarly attention, the wars that propelled these men to <br/>
prominence have not received the same scrutiny. Recent scholarship has <br/>
revealed, however, that warfare was instrumental to change rather than <br/>
merely expressive of it.<br/>
The outbreak of war in 1331 and destruction of the Kamakura bakufu in <br/>
1333 were catalysts for profound transformations in Japan; to <br/>
understand the changes in state and society, we must first explore the <br/>
nature of the warfare that was endemic in this period. This essay <br/>
reconstructs the experience of Nomoto Tomoyuki, a fourteenth-century <br/>

 </span></blockquote>Oh, Lord, no. You're right about Japanese sources for primary lingo research,<br/>
but you've already listed most of the common source texts used in classes.<br/>
Depending on specializations, we work with Mass (and the Massites) and Janssen,<br/>
as well as Friday and Farris. And Elisonas, of course (Deus Destroyed is a<br/>
classic.) Many others have only one or two books out there, but they're really<br/>
useful in their areas (Shirane,  Barger, Adolphson, etc.).<br/>
<br/>
When people are getting into Japanese, I often send them to Sansom for a<br/>
general historical overview to find an area that interests them, but I'd never<br/>
rely on it or teach it.<br/>
<br/>
And then there are the Japanese books, both modern scholarship and critical<br/>
texts. I love the Japanese; who else publishes books with the near corpus of<br/>
the classical language literature in their language? With collections like the<br/>
Nihon Koten Bungaku Taikei, the Nihon Koten Bungaku Zenshu, the Nihon Shiso<br/>
Taikei and so on, I'm in hog heaven.<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Definitely. We see a lot of them in literature, too. Plus theories are<br/>
constantly being re-evaluated. I've totally reversed my position on the Emishi,<br/>
for example, and have come into line with the current theory that they<br/>
*weren't* any different than the regular "Yamato" Japanese except that they<br/>
refused to submit to central court rule. The evidence seems rather compelling.<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>It's good if they can, but it's not a major factor. Certainly for an undergrad<br/>
major you need three years in the language, and that's enough to at least work<br/>
through popular historical texts. For grad school, of course primary language<br/>
research is pretty much required. I have little use for people who do grad work<br/>
in an area studies field entirely in their mother tongue. <g><br/>

 </span></blockquote>I can relate. I can read Mass in a day or so, but if I were reading the<br/>
Japanese equivalent of Mass it would take me many days. Frustrating....<br/>
