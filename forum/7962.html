<div id="ygrps-yiv-848993129">I know I am not a frequent writer of this group, but that is because I haven't got enough acknowledge of what you discuss. Even if I know this I need your help, and it is not the first time. Well, I am writing a sort of a biography about Takasugi Shinsaku and I am trying to put an end to this. But now I have a problem due to my poor japanese level. I found an exchange of poetries between Takasugi and Nomura Boto. The firts is a poetry wrote by Takasugi while he was lying sick in bed:<br/>
 <br/>
omoshiroki koto mo naki yoni         yo=the first kanji of SEKAI-world<br/>
omoshiroku<br/>
 <br/>
to this Nomura answered:<br/>
 <br/>
suminasumo nowa<br/>
kokoro narikeri<br/>
 <br/>
and then, finally, Takasugi wrote:<br/>
 <br/>
omoroinou<br/>
 <br/>
I translated the first poetry with in a singular way, trying to underline Takasugi's spirit<br/>
 <br/>
even in a world without matters<br/>
do something meaningful<br/>
 <br/>
(well in italian it sounds a little better...)<br/>
 <br/>
but for the second and third poetry I am in big troubles. So I am looking for someone help to translate it in english...or in french, in italian... in particular the second one it is very important! The third one could also be eliminated from my text.<br/>
I am beggin you all!!!!!!!!!!!!<br/>
Please ...<br/>
thanks in advance!<br/>
Frison Daniele<br/>
 <br/>
ps: this is the web link where I was able to find this poetry <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.webkohbo.com/info3/takasugi/togyoan.html">http://www.webkohbo.com/info3/takasugi/togyoan.html</a><br/>

Nomura Motoni or Botoni (it is read both ways, it seems) (1806-67) <br/>

<br/>
According to this piece Sugi Taki or Takiko (Yoshida's mother) had 7 <br/>
children, of whom Shoin was the second son. The family were very <br/>
poor, partly due to a debt incurred by their grandfather, and became <br/>
"half farmers. half bushi". Taki worked endlessly on the farm and in <br/>
raising the children. After Shoin was imprisoned in Noyama jail in Hagi, <br/>
(1854 -55) she visited him with gifts of food, warm clothes etc. When <br/>
he was released and allowed to start the Shoka Sonjuku Taki looked <br/>
after the students, fed them, bought sake for them, and mended their <br/>
clothes. By all accounts, even though Shoin was adopted by the <br/>
Yoshida family at 4 years old (according to Craig) his relationship with <br/>
his birth family was always very close and loving. There is a moving <br/>
poem inscribed in his shrine in Hagi which reads in English:<br/>
"The concerns of parents for their children are deeper than those of <br/>
children for their parents.<br/>
How much will it grieve my parents to hear today's tidings."<br/>
(written just before his execution in Edo)<br/>
<br/>
Despite her hard life Taki lived to the age of 84 and was famous for her <br/>
unassuming kindness.<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
There's so much more material available in Japanese and it is written <br/>
from such a different viewpoint. This probably sounds like a truism but <br/>
it's worth emphasising, I think. My Japanese reading is very slow but I <br/>
persevere with it because I think it's so important. For sources in <br/>
English, there are far more in University libraries and academic papers <br/>
and journals than I have access to. I'm sure other people on this forum <br/>
can advise you where to look. But if you can read Japanese so much <br/>
more is available to you both on the web and in books.<br/>
