<h3>About Rurouni Kenshin</h3>
by <i>Ben Hertschap</i>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-956022920">Hi there,<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Rurouni Kenshin is a japanese cartoon; wich are called "animé". It is based<br/>
on a 28 volume counting "manga" = comic<br/>
by Nobuhiro Watsuki.<br/>
<br/>
The story line shifts between bakumatsu and early meiji (I think.........i'm<br/>
no expert on those stuff ^^). While it has some<br/>
historical true value; all charachters and events are for 85-90% fiction.<br/>
<br/>
If you wanna know more, visit www.anipike.com for more info about Kenshin<br/>
and animé.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Best regards,<br/>
<br/>
<br/>

    This is not my idea of the Bakumatsu, Rurouni seems a bit Okama poku...<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1840354841">The OAV version of Kenshin (4 parts split between 2 DVD/VHS: "Trust" <br/>
and "Betrayal")can easliy stand up against almost any live action <br/>
Samurai drama.  Its tragic, very serious and very well done. This <br/>
version of Kenshin shows us the "man-killer" side of him that he once <br/>
was. I would recommend this to anyone, even those not "into" anime.<br/>
<br/>
The TV series version of Kenshin is quite different and takes place <br/>
several years after the events in the OAV.  It is long (96 or so <br/>
episodes) and although overall the plots are serious, the Kenshin of <br/>
the TV series now wields the "sword that protects" and the characters <br/>
tend to be more over the top as only anime characters can be.  The TV <br/>
series has great characters, good storylines and Kenshin displays a <br/>
wonderful (if idealistic) code of honor that we would all wish to <br/>
live up to.  This series would appeal mostly though to those already <br/>
versed in anime and all that this style of animation entails or to <br/>
those just looking for a great story with great characters. Those <br/>
looking strictly for "history" would not be into it.</div>
