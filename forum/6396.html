I made a totally tongue-in-cheek reference to the thought of learning samurai history by watching 'The Last Samurai'  by saying I <br/>
was going to go watch 'Return of the King' to learn about medieval history.<br/>
<br/>
Nathan took it from there with a referral to the French likeness to trolls; it was the first creature to flee the melee as the Ring <br/>
was melting. Thread is in the archives, and not very far back if you hustle over.<br/>
