 </span></blockquote>I've been waiting for it for some time. It's supposed to be quite scholarly, and the definitive book on Nobunaga in English. The<br/>
author apparently was one of the students of my "dai-sensei", Jurgis Elisonas.<br/>

author...interesting parallels between Nobunaga and<br/>
Machiavelli's Prince...<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Ummm.... "plodding 'university' book"?<br/>
<br/>
I don't think I've ever seen one of those.<br/>
<br/>
I assume you mean one of those boring things with citations and footnotes and<br/>
references? I'm sorry, those are the only books I take seriously.<br/>
<br/>
But then again, I *am* a historian, and read those for fun. <G><br/>

<h3>Re: [samuraihistory] New Oda Nobunaga Book</h3>

<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1992697220">What I meant by a plodding university book is the type of book written by<br/>
people in academia for people in academia, and usually quite<br/>
incomprehensible to the ordinary layman. Books like Shogunal Politics by<br/>
Kate Nakai, State and Diplomacy by Ronald Toby. These books do have there<br/>
place and I'm not knocking them per se. The problem I have with the field of<br/>
Japanese historiograpy is that there are few (very few) well written<br/>
narrative histories like the type done by say Robert Massie, Simon Schama,<br/>
David McCollough, or Stephan Ambrose. While I*am*not a historian I do love a<br/>
good book on history. I don't shy away from books with citations and<br/>
footnotes as long as they are well written, that describe the period in well<br/>
constructed details, and with a human touch. I do shy away from long turpid<br/>
discussions about the exact nomenclature of the shugo. Of course these type<br/>
of books have been written in Japanese, and when I go to Maruzen or<br/>
Kinokuniya I drool over the amoont of material available that simply is not<br/>
available in English. However reading Japanese books is too much like<br/>
studying. Its really difficult taking a Kanji dictionary on the train with<br/>
you. Now I confess I am being lazy, having lived here for 7 years and still<br/>
my reading level is about 6th grade.I feel though that anybody who is<br/>
interested in Japanese history, interested say in the life of Takeda<br/>
Shingen, or daily life in the Nara period , or a good history of the<br/>
Nanbokucho period shouldn't have to spend a lifetime mastering the Japanese<br/>
language in order to do so. On the other hand there have been plenty of<br/>
wonderful books on Russian history in english enough that one wouldn't have<br/>
to master the Russian language to read about Ivan the Terrible. If this type<br/>
of historical writing can be done in other feilds why not Japanese history?<br/>
