<div id="ygrps-yiv-840822082">Greetings to all,<br/>
  I was wondering for the longer if anyone here have a different name  for <br/>
Nagao Kagatore, he fought in the Kawanakashima against Takeda, the  fought on <br/>
more than one occation but neither ever killed each other and  Takada never took <br/>
Kagatore's lands.  Any info would be greatly  appresiated.<br/>
 <br/>
Humbly,<br/>
Nakagawa Sukeie<br/>
 <br/>
To ask a question, may be a moments shame,<br/>
but  not to ask and remain ignorant, is a life long  shame.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-824519789">Thank you all, I wasn't unaware of the name change, there is a pretty good  <br/>
movie I watched back in the 90s and was wondering why his name was not a <br/>
popular  one, and with the information provided by all of you, I come to find out <br/>
that he  change his name so I can do some more research.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>You're probably thinking of the movie "Heaven and Earth" - Uesugi<br/>
Kenshin is only referred to as Nagao Kagetora through the first 1/4th<br/>
to 1/2 of the movie, afte which he is refered to as Uesugi Kenshin,<br/>
but the subtitles stay "Nagao Kagetora" the entire movie, probably for<br/>
2 reasons - they probably figured no one in the West would understand<br/>
why his name changed halfway through the movie, and the the<br/>
translators probably didn't realize that Uesugi Kenshin is known in<br/>
the west, at least to people with a little knowledge of Japanese<br/>
history.  The subtitles should have refered to him as Uesugi Kenshin.<br/>
 I think the narrator does mention that Takeda Harunobu changed his<br/>
name to Takeda Shingen, and so that would have been another option.</div>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1867628909">Yeap, you hit in dead center.  I watched it so long ago I don't  remember <br/>
paying attention to the actual language, I guest I should buy the movie  or rent <br/>
it noe that I am a bit more familiar with japanese culture and naming  <br/>
traditions.  Thanks,<br/>
