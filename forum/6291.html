...........for that is who you are, whether or not you hold an academic post....<br/>
<br/>
I have seen both the main movie and the appendix......  and admit it is the first TC .... no .... second...  I saw 'Legend' about a <br/>
hundred years ago, but I digress...<br/>
<br/>
I'd very much like to read a post that enumerates the inaccuracies of the movie as is, not as you wish it to be, and reveals what is <br/>
the true history instead.  I have read a great deal of slamming (and elsewhere in other forums), but have yet to come across any <br/>
post that educates....<br/>
<br/>
For example:  the seppuku of General Hasagawa was not accurate from a 'formal seppuku' reference point, but what was the historical <br/>
ritual during/after battle?<br/>
<br/>
There would be no poems, white robes,  the cut did not go all the way through, and I forget the name of that piece of furniture <br/>
directly in front of the individual so that his shoulders & head landed on that, and thus avoided having the head bounce around on <br/>
the ground and his corpse avoided the indignity of having his butt in the air.  I assume the final expulsion of body fluids was <br/>
provided for by careful fundoshi wrapping.<br/>
<br/>
To me, the cut made by Katsumoto seemed inaccurate because it not went all the way through and allowed the head to roll away,  with <br/>
the indignities to the corpse and all, and the kiai.  I think that traditionally  the ritual was performed in silence.<br/>
<br/>
Armor: I don't know from squat, and would love to learn.  Yes, I've read Tony's pages. My questions are these, so far:  how <br/>
impoverished was the samurai class by the Meiji period; hadn't the shogunate been defunct by around twenty years by the time frame <br/>
of the movie; and how many generations might a suit of armor last?<br/>
<br/>
Whether or not the widow or kids wanted to off TC, they would do as they were told by K,  the widow's brother.   Same thing with <br/>
Ujio.  Same thing in the capture scene in the fog.<br/>
<br/>
The battle sequences, one must remember, were western tactics, not Japanese.<br/>
<br/>
I am not trying to rationalize the movie,  I want to know the specific differences between history, tradition, and 'dramatic <br/>
license.  That being said, I find it difficult to 'suspend disbelief' in medical shows, because of my profession.  I also know that <br/>
some portrayals of medical procedures/information are deliberately inaccurate.<br/>
<br/>
If the producers had wanted to make a more accurate film,  would it not have been more appropriate for 'the History Channel', itself <br/>
a bit inaccurate in it's re-enactments?<br/>
<br/>
Lastly, a challenge:   I know it is easy to be an armchair jockey or quarterback.....    and it is possible to gain a position on a <br/>
film production crew as a technical advisor.....    instead of complaining,  how about being pro-active and get involved in the <br/>
process?<br/>
<br/>
Always willing to learn,<br/>

Why not? I've seen tons better. Shoot, even Kurosawa's<br/>
worst battle scenes (melodramatic Kagemusha, anyone?)<br/>
were better than that.<br/>

Please understand that some people (this means YOU,<br/>
Tony) would find fault with just about any movie. I<br/>
know he finds fault with Taiga Drama at times. But<br/>
excellent point about not "educating". We'll try to<br/>
get some comments on that. <br/>
<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>If this were a Sengoku battle, I could simply say<br/>
"there were no *set* rituals yet", but being as it's<br/>
post Tokugawa and all those fun Bushido rules had been<br/>
codified, there in fact *were* rules about how to do<br/>
these sorts of things. I'm not the slightest bit of an<br/>
Edo period expert, so I couldn't help you with the<br/>
details, alas. But I would think that most of the<br/>
*rules* didn't apply in battlefield situations--there<br/>
had been perilously few battles in the previous 250<br/>
years for the situation to come up. <br/>
Your description of flaws you observed sounds fine to<br/>
me, given that even though this was on a battlefield,<br/>
the customs of the time would dictate certain<br/>
etiquette, possibly. <br/>
<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Taken care of, it could last quite a long time. As for<br/>
how impoverished were they? Well, there were rich<br/>
samurai, and poor ones. The Shogunate doesn't enter<br/>
into this, since as you point out it was defunct for 2<br/>
decades, so I'm not sure where you are going with that<br/>
question. But while there are many tales of samurai<br/>
selling their swords to eat, or daimyo letting their<br/>
retainers go at the end of the Edo period, there were<br/>
also Daimyo who remained wealthy. The Daimyo of the<br/>
Choshu han let many of his retainers go under the<br/>
pretext of poverty, but with the added intention of<br/>
providing a marauding disturbance for the Shogunate to<br/>
deal with. <br/>
<br/>

 </span></blockquote>I think Tony's done that. <br/>
<br/>
Bear with me, it's been a while since I've seen it. As<br/>
Kitsuno has said, it's watchable to me, if I suspend<br/>
historical knowledge and watch it as a story taking<br/>
place somewhere that sort of looks like Japan. <br/>
<br/>
Main issues I had:<br/>
<br/>
1. Samurai didn't despise guns. They used them very<br/>
effectively 300 years before the events in the movie<br/>
supposedly take place. Suggesting otherwise makes the<br/>
movie romantic, but kills any semblence of reality. <br/>
<br/>
2. Katsumoto, being a Daimyo, should have lived a<br/>
little better than in some remote mountain village. It<br/>
played more into the "Dances with Samurai" theme for<br/>
him to do so. <br/>
<br/>
3. The ninja attack was pure Hollywood. It was only<br/>
there because any Hollywood samurai movie has got to<br/>
have a ninja attack, right?<br/>
<br/>
4. Gaijin = no meet Emperor. That was pure silliness. <br/>
<br/>
5. Katsumoto is LOOSELY based on Saigo Takamori. As<br/>
in, he was the leader of a group of disgruntled, armed<br/>
Samurai who took umbrage with being deprived of their<br/>
status. That's about the extent.<br/>
<br/>
6. MOST IMPORTANT POINT: Ahlgren's<br/>
drunkenness--deplorable. No self-respecting member of<br/>
the 7th Cavalry would fail to hold their liquor like<br/>
that. I should know--I've been in the 7th twice! We<br/>
were a hard-drinking group, for sure--Ahlgren would<br/>
have wilted like a pansy. <br/>
<br/>
I'll probably end up watching it again, and I'll be<br/>
able to talk about some more. I actually liked the<br/>
movie, but then again, I had convinced myself it took<br/>
place on another planet. <br/>
