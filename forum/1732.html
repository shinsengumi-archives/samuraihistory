<h3>Sword History</h3>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-460507381">In response to some questions raised by Tom and Carlo I added to <br/>
photos to the album. One is of the blade tip and the first several <br/>
inches. (Tom, see I am learning. I did not know what a kissaki or a <br/>
monouchi is, but I looked them up in a glossary.) Even though it was <br/>
taken outside, without flash, there is some glare in this pic. If you <br/>
can not see what you are looking for, tell me and I will see if I can <br/>
get a clearer photo.<br/>
<br/>
The second pic is of the inside of a flap on the leather scabbard. I <br/>
do not know what the characters say. I assume they identify the sword <br/>
owner. This photo was taken inside with a flash using a friend's <br/>
camera that does a better job on real close shots.<br/>
