<div id="ygrps-yiv-1664368155">A RESPONSE; the only 'real' books on the subject I have are the following, "Bushido" by Inazo, "Hagakure;The Book of the Samurai," by Yamamoto Tsunetomo. I don't think my "Zen" books count but I have a few of them as well. As for the tc movie, I liked the scenery, some of the history was accurate, the final battle scene was very well done even if tc survived. I love Japanese history and love their literature. I was just hoping for a better movie that showed Japan and it's history; its a fascinating country and people; lived on Okinawa, Japan for two years. <br/>

A friend of mine worked on the film, and said it was a miserable process, as there was nothing but sheep and scientologists in the general area, which made for a kind of wretched night-life.<br/>

Parts of Last Samurai were indeed filmed in Japan. There were scenes <br/>
shot at temple complexes near my home in Kyoto (Chion-In was one) and <br/>
in the general vicinity. These were primarily the shots with just <br/>
Watanabe and TC rather than the big battle scenes (New Zealand).</div>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1788141143">...Well, leave us not forget Yoshikawa Eiji's _Musashi_ and Inagaki<br/>
Hiroshi's film adaptation, "The Samurai Trilogy."    Inagaki's "Chushingura"<br/>
ought to be on that list too, I believe.  And I don't believe "Hidden<br/>
Fortress" is on that list as yet...<br/>
If we weren't talking fiction, I'd add Musashi's own _Book of Five Rings (or<br/>
Spheres)_, the Tengu-Geijutsu-Ron of Chozan Shissai (Shissai Chozan?) and<br/>
the Heiho Kaden Sho of the Yagyu, Soho's _The Unfettered Mind_... but it was<br/>
fiction you specified, Thomas, so I won't.  For your purposes, however,<br/>
David, some of those might be of considerable interest.<br/>
And Thomas, as well as Kitsuno, thanks again for that "...Last Sword..."<br/>
recommendation.  I'm very much looking forward to that.  Sounds splendid.<br/>
