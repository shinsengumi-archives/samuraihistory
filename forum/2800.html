 </span></blockquote>See also Water margin / written by Shih Nai-an ; translated by J. H. <br/>
Jackson. There may be others as well. A good read, influenced several <br/>
Japanese Ukiyo-e artists along with probably others.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>The battle of Lepanto involved over 200,000 people in a naval action! <br/>
This is the equivalent of any major Japanese battle in period. The ratio <br/>
of guns in most of the European armies were probably fairly close to <br/>
Japan, in recent discussions on another list, figures were around 20-30% <br/>
for Europe with Japan peaking around 30%. The much more massive scale I <br/>
think is not a justified claim. The period I'm thinking of is post-1550s <br/>
to the final Sengoku battles.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>That's something that's hard to measure though. I think Japan has a kick <br/>
ass army in this period, but by how much is impossible to determine <br/>
because we can't steal thier armies and make them fight it out as a test.<br/>
