<h3>Heaven and Earth Review</h3>

<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1416190774">I read the review of Heaven and Earth that was linked here a while <br/>
ago when I asked about the movie on DVD.  I can tell that guy didn't <br/>
like it, and I think he sees Kurasawa as god, at least he acts like <br/>
it.  One thing I can see that shows that he didnt give it chance when <br/>
he mentions that Kagetora is waiting or 6 days for troops from a <br/>
castle that is a 2 day ride.  It doesn't seem to take much thought to <br/>
me to see this as possible.  2 days for meengers to arrive, time to <br/>
mobilize the garrison, and then 2 days back, and the almost <br/>
invetiable delays in the actual travel.  Just something that has been <br/>
on my mind and wanted to speak my peace.</div>
