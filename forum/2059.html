<h3>kabuki & swords</h3>
by <i>matthewhoyle2000</i>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1256621508">Does anyone know if the Kabuki actors of 17th, 18th and 19th cent Japan<br/>
used real swords in <br/>
their plays ? <br/>
 <br/>
Looking at ukiyo-e you would think so, some of the koshirae looks very <br/>
elaborate. <br/>
 <br/>
If this is the case wouldn't the theater people have gigantic<br/>
collections of <br/>
swords rusting away somewhere ?<br/>
 <br/>
Just curious.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1116317854">I found this bit of info, but I am afraid it doesn't go into further <br/>
detail, but it does indicate real swords were used, at least in the <br/>
19th century.<br/>
<br/>
"Until the latter part of the 19th century, Kabuki actors owned and <br/>
took care of their own props. Today, however, about 40 employees at <br/>
the Fujinami Properties Co. handle them. Many of these props are <br/>
genuine articles - real swords, netsuke, tobacco pouches, hibachi <br/>
and so forth. They are priceless not only because of their intrinsic <br/>
value, but also because they have histories of being used by famous <br/>
actors such as Danjuro, Kikugoro and Kichiemon."<br/>
