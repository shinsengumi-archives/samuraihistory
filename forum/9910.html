 </span></blockquote>It's really quite hard to say... for instance how do you know that they were in fact Japanese, given that, I'm guessing, you don't speak Nihongo?<br/>

The interpretation of dreams is a tricky field in its own right, but you could look at in a Freudian ssense if that helps. None of the work Freud, or Jung for that matter, is 'proven' empirical science, but it does help some people.<br/>
