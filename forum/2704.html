their own way. The Muslim fundamentalist, for example. I DO NOT MEAN to <br/>
open a can of worm here, I am against violence and the killing of <br/>
innocents, but the Mujadeens live a spartan life, practice martial <br/>

At the same time, some of the UN/US soldiers probably live a very <br/>

So, I won't call bushido out as anachronistic, and -even when I will <br/>
NOT suggest it- I suppose that joining the army is the best way to <br/>
practice the 'way of the warrior' today.<br/>

the objetive of bushido, can be seen on what is nowadays called BUDO, that <br/>
is a way of enlightment, e personal struggle for improvement, and do so to <br/>
have a better family, a better society and a better contry to live. as for a <br/>
person that does not live it, that's its meaning.<br/>
On the topic of not folling bushido, that no point in following a code of <br/>
rules, stated once that bushido is not a code of rules, and was never meant <br/>
to be written, but with the ages its was written a book called <br/>
Budoshoshinsho, but it was written without the permission of the sensei(wich <br/>
and dont recall the name) but it was written on the spirit of not letting to <br/>
be forgot, because it was cosidered something extremely beatifull, and <br/>
something to be a guide a the life of those seeking for it.<br/>
Hope i 've not been to confuse.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-68338551">Hi Lee.<br/>
Sorry, I do not think that is the appropriate place to talk about <br/>
modern world politics. My take, as I have said, is that I am against <br/>
violence and the killing of innocents. Said that, I think we should not <br/>
enter in the merit of being pro or against war in Iraq and so on in <br/>
this mailing list.<br/>
<br/>
What I wanted to say is only that I do believe that there still are <br/>
people who live their life mainly as warriors. That  was my point, and <br/>
I wanted to make without taking any political position.<br/>
<br/>
Regarding the para-militias and the Waco guys, I do not know them <br/>
enough to judge. I believe they have never been in a real battle, and <br/>
probably they do not fancy to - otherwise they would sign up for the <br/>
real army.<br/>
Bye!<br/>
