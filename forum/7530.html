<h3>Ii Clan (was RE: [samuraihistory] Re: Top Ten Samurai Movies)</h3>
by <i>ninaboal21044</i>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-2102891032">That's my favorite, and I watch it all the time. I just got the new<br/>
Criterion release and it's great, with all the interviews in it.<br/>
 <br/>
However, now I do want to get into some actual history. Concerning the Ii<br/>
clan. I know that they wore red armor and that there is a story about them<br/>
from their earlier days of glory. Apparently, during one of the battles<br/>
(forget which one), one of their generals stationed some strong men at the<br/>
rear, to prevent anyone from deserting even in the midst of a hard-fought<br/>
battle. Some stern stuff here.<br/>
 <br/>
***SPOILER ALERT for those who haven't yet seen the film and don't wish to<br/>
know what happens.<br/>
 <br/>
As I was watching SEPPUKU (the western title is "Hara Kiri"). In the course<br/>
of the film, a ragged, destitute ronin shows up at the gate of the Ii clan's<br/>
Edo headquarters, presumably to request a place to commit seppuku so that he<br/>
no longer would have to live in dire poverty. But in reality, he is in<br/>
desperate need for money to get a doctor for his sick child, so he is making<br/>
this request in the hope that the Ii clan members will feel sorry for him.<br/>
That they will give him money to go away -- and with the money, he can get<br/>
aid for his sick son. <br/>
 <br/>
Instead, the Ii clan members insist that he actually commit seppuku. The<br/>
ronin is so destitute that he has pawned his swords and is wearing blades of<br/>
bamboo. When the clan members find this out, they are outraged and decide to<br/>
force him to commit seppuku with his own bamboo wakizashi. Which he does in<br/>
great agony. Later on, his father-in-law (Nakadai) seeks to avenge this<br/>
death and people can watch the film to see what happens.<br/>
 <br/>
But in actual history: I was wondering: during the 17th century, did the<br/>
historical Ii clan actually have any tendencies toward the type of sadism<br/>
that the film shows them to have? According to the film, the bamboo seppuku<br/>
was a matter of public record (the revenge for this is what is covered up by<br/>
the clan officials).  It was considered to be an appropriate punishment for<br/>
a begging ronin who came to request seppuku but had sold his blades ("the<br/>
soul of the samurai"), so he only had blades of bamboo.<br/>
 <br/>
I've heard vaguely from a few others that there was a real history of<br/>
destitute ronin appearing at clan gates to presumably request a spot for<br/>
seppuku -- but who actually wanted "go away" money. Is there any history of<br/>
anyone ever being forced to commit seppuku with a bamboo blade? Was the Ii<br/>
clan ever involved in any of this sort of thing? <br/>
 <br/>
Or did the novelist Takiguchi Yasuhiko, who wrote the original story<br/>
SEPPUKU, make up all of this out of thin air and his fertile imagination? If<br/>
Takiguchi made up all of this, why would he use a real clan, the Ii clan,<br/>
for his scenario? Why not use a fictional clan? <br/>
 <br/>
Just curious. Thanks, Nina Boal  <br/>

 Hara Kiri-the best of the noble ronin films, the 2 Â½ hrs just fly <br/>

<h3>Ii Clan</h3>
by <i>thomas_tessera</i>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-758331281">Hi Nina,<br/>
<br/>
"Concerning the Ii clan. I know that they wore red armor and that<br/>
there is a story about them from their earlier days of glory."<br/>
<br/>
Indeed the clan flourished under the Tokugawa. The red armour was<br/>
actually suggested by Ieyasu himself, who had noted that one of the<br/>
Takeda generals, Yamagata Masakage, had dressed his men in red armour.<br/>
(credit: samurai-archive)<br/>
<br/>
"But in actual history: I was wondering: during the 17th century, did<br/>
the historical Ii clan actually have any tendencies toward the type of<br/>
sadism that the film shows them to have?"<br/>
<br/>
This is a broad topic, and I am only an amateur, but allow me to offer<br/>
somew views on this topic, and maybe some others might chip in. A bit<br/>
lengthy, but it's a big topic.<br/>
<br/>
Every comment need be headed 'In my view... '<br/>
<br/>
I don't think it was sadism per se, but such an attitude existed and<br/>
was general to its class. These men were largely warriors without a<br/>
war, so they looked at other means to demonstrate their prowess, and<br/>
one means was to ensure that others stuck to the code. If I insist you<br/>
commit seppuku, it's because I would in your situation. Whether this<br/>
is actually true or not is another matter, but as long as you're not<br/>
put to the test, then no-one will ever know...<br/>
<br/>
Seppuku, and a close relation junshi (the practice of retainers<br/>
killing themselves upon the death of their lord) assumed an importance<br/>
out of all reasonable proportion in peacetime. With no-one out to kill<br/>
me, the next best way to show my worth is to kill myself. Junshi was<br/>
rarely practiced in earlier eras, and was frowned upon if not<br/>
expressly forbidden by the authorities.<br/>
<br/>
Earlier and more violent eras were a lot more pragmatic. "He who<br/>
fights and runs away," as the saying goes, and if every samurai lived<br/>
by the post-Edo ideal then none of them would have survived their<br/>
inevitable reverses in fortune. Life might be ephemeral, but it was<br/>
precious, and the martial ryu taught that to throw one's life away was<br/>
a waste, and stupid.<br/>
<br/>
Let me illustrate with a true tale of the peacetime samurai: two men<br/>
pass on the stairs of Edo Castle. As they do, the sheaths of their<br/>
swords accidentally clash. This was considered an insult beyond repair<br/>
(it was a technique used to start a fight, a show of disrespect of the<br/>
other person). Fighting in the castle was prohibited, but 'samurai<br/>
honour' demands instant redress of insult (notably the author of The<br/>
Hagakure considered the loyal 47 ronin to be despicable for waiting so<br/>
long. They sould have acted that very day, and been killed to a man),<br/>
so what happens, "I'll show you the kind of man I am!" shouts one,<br/>
draws his sword and kills himself, there on the stairs. The other is<br/>
horrified, he races on, delivers the message, returns, "how dare you<br/>
act in such a way as to imply my dishonour!" and, you guessed it, he<br/>
draws his sword and kills himself, too.<br/>
<br/>
An extreme case, I grant you, but a telling one. Two lives lost for<br/>
what? Injured pride.<br/>
<br/>
I would suggest that the Ii officials knew this fellow was looking for<br/>
'go away' money, but also saw there was some fun to be had ...<br/>
undoubtedly there were sadistic b*st*rds around, our unfortunate<br/>
fellow just happened to run into one of them.<br/>
<br/>
There is a tale of a thousand match contest in the Muto Ryu (founded<br/>
by Tesshu, a swordsman of great renown) where the fencer has to fight<br/>
a thousand matches over a 3-day period. Few have done it, but one man<br/>
did, and on the third day, still a long way short of his mark, he was<br/>
challenged by a man whom he knew delighted in nothing more than<br/>
injuring his opponents in a fencing match. Our hero (who by this stage<br/>
was in such a pass that he later recorded he was passing blood in his<br/>
urine) squared his shoulders, and stepped forward. Master Tesshu, who<br/>
knew both men, saw this and stopped the bout, declaring our hero the<br/>
victor not only of the match, but of the total challenge.<br/>
<br/>
In short I would declare the attitude you highlight a psychological<br/>
sickness not unknown in the military, where some feel the need to<br/>
prove their prowess at every turn, but have no valid means of so doing.<br/>
<br/>
In the UK I remember there was some furore over the activities of the<br/>
Parachute Regiment (an elite unit) that might be considered along the<br/>
same lines, who went through a period of picking fights with regular<br/>
army units stationed nearby. I know of one guy in a very elite unit<br/>
who would never drink in a pub if there were other members of his own<br/>
unit present, as there was sure to be a fight.<br/>
<br/>
It's a man thing.<br/>
<br/>
(If I appear to be hard on the samurai, I am harder on the Tokugawa<br/>
Shogunate, who continually demonstrated an inability to get to grips<br/>
with these issues, and fudged things miserably at times. To my very<br/>
limited knowledge, it seems the authorities invariably fudged things<br/>
terribly when it came to matters of seppuku and samurai discipline in<br/>
general.)<br/>

<h3>RE: [samuraihistory] Ii Clan</h3>
by <i>ninaboal21044</i>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1843063236">Great points. What is "sadism" according to our modern sensabilties (which<br/>
include all sorts of acceptable sadisms of our own)? And what is a proper,<br/>
appropriate response to an action seen as being an outrage within the<br/>
context of 17th century samurai ethics?<br/>
 <br/>
The following is all speculative, as this is a list discussing samurai<br/>
history and not a list where we discuss Japanese cinema. However, reading<br/>
what I've read, and drawing a few speculative conclusions (which might be<br/>
wrong): I would not be at all surprised to see that an account existed at<br/>
one time in a clan's logbook about a begging ronin who had bamboo swords<br/>
being forced to commit seppuku with his own bamboo wakizashi. So I will<br/>
continue my discussion as one of possible history and not as a discussion<br/>
about a film. <br/>
 <br/>
Put yourself in the viewpoint of a 17th century clansmen (hanshi). You serve<br/>
your clan and lord faithfully. The wars are over, still you wish to uphold<br/>
the code of bushido (which by the way had NOT been recorded as a "how to"<br/>
official manual). Some ragged fellow wearing two swords and who speaks the<br/>
language of a man of the samurai class appears at your clan gate. He tells<br/>
the oft-repeated story about how he's a ronin who is so poor he wants to<br/>
commit seppuku in a corner of your clan's back yard. How many times have you<br/>
heard this sad tale before? <br/>
 <br/>
Fast foward a bit to modern times. Many of us, at least in the U.S. (and<br/>
probably in other countries) have seen the ragged folk on the corners with<br/>
signs "will work for food." But when some of these folks are approached to<br/>
actually do some work, they give excuses. And it turns out that they don't<br/>
want a job, they want a handout. <br/>
 <br/>
Back to 17th century Edo in Japan. You, the loyal hanshi, invite the poor<br/>
guy in and relate to your superiors this sad tale that he bears. Does he<br/>
really want to commit seppuku or is he just looking for a handout? You<br/>
decide that it doesn't matter, that your clan stands for upholding samurai<br/>
honor and a samurai must be taken at his word. So he will commit seppuku, as<br/>
he has stated that he wishes to do. <br/>
 <br/>
Then somewhere along the line, you and your fellow clansmen discover that<br/>
the ragged ronin was carrying bamboo sword blades. This brings a whole<br/>
different issue to the fore. Because as a loyal samurai and hanshi, you have<br/>
learned all of your life that "The Sword Is The Soul of the Samurai." And<br/>
yes, this idea of the sword, as opposed to other weapons, being so important<br/>
to fighting samurai was largely not true in earlier times of Japanese<br/>
history. But by the time of the peaceful Edo period, this idea had become<br/>
almost "gospel." So in this particular time, the sword is supposed to be the<br/>
"living soul" of the samurai.  <br/>
 <br/>
So this ronin has commited an outrage by having sold his sword blades and<br/>
hiding his shame by carrying replacement blades of bamboo -- which would be<br/>
totally useless in a real fight. Why did he do it? To feed his starving<br/>
family? Because he needed the money for more sake or opium? Who knows? And<br/>
according to our 17th century hanshi and his colleagues -- who cares? In<br/>
effect, the man has sold his soul. And must be punished simply for that. But<br/>
on top of it, he claims to want to participate in the sacred ritual of<br/>
seppuku. And doesn't possess the means for doing so.  It's clear that the<br/>
lying wretch is trying to extort the clan for a handout and has no intention<br/>
to commit seppuku. <br/>
 <br/>
So you and your colleagues decide to take a stand for Bushido. Not only<br/>
force this guy to commit seppuku, but force him to use his own sword to do<br/>
it. What a way to send a message that the code of Bushido isn't dead, even<br/>
though it has taken a battering in recent, peaceful times. <br/>
 <br/>
Back a bit to the fictional account written by Takiguchi Yasuhiko (which<br/>
later became the film, SEPPUKU). In these works, the account of the bamboo<br/>
sword seppuku becomes public record, and there is no protest against this.<br/>
So unless the accounts of these events were vivid figments of Takiguchi's<br/>
over-active imagination, it can be logically speculated that this act by a<br/>
clan, which some of us here and now consider an act of sadism, was<br/>
considered acceptable within the context of the society where it happened.  <br/>
 <br/>
History is full of atrocities that occured that were considered acceptable<br/>
within the context of the times where they took place. It's chilling. Not a<br/>
pleasant subject; it seems easier for a lot of us to wander off in<br/>
speculations about how noble the samurai were and always have been. Not so. <br/>
 <br/>
So why am I drawn to this whole speculation? I'm working on a piece of<br/>
historical fiction where one of the characters, an impoverished 18th century<br/>
ronin, has pawned his swords and has replaced them with bamboo blades. And<br/>
must deal with the consequences of that action. He doesn't try and gain<br/>
money by claiming to want to commit seppuku. Still, he runs into harrowing<br/>
choices and events. And I get to ruminate in the issue of what really<br/>
constitutes a "soul" and whether or not it might be encased in a sword. And<br/>
also run head-on into other issues that go beyond 18th century Japan. <br/>
 <br/>
Again, my two mon. Which has turned into a few ryo. Perhaps useless<br/>
ramblings.<br/>
 <br/>

<h3>Ii Clan (was RE: [samuraihistory] Re: Top Ten Samurai Movies)</h3>
by <i>kurotatsunoshi</i>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-747589511">I'm not aware of any specific instances in which the Ii treated a <br/>
ronin (or anyone else) in an unnecessarily harsh manner. The reason <br/>
the screenwriter chose the Ii clan could have been a combination of <br/>
several factors:<br/>
1)The empty suit of armor in Hara-kiri is one of the most important <br/>
symbols in the film. The Ii clan red suits of armor were among the <br/>
most distinctive and famous in Japan, particularly Naomasa's horned <br/>
suit (presumably the one featured in the film) and made a perfect <br/>
cinematic fit. It was also interesting that they chose to use the <br/>
incorrect Ii hatch mark standard (only used in wartime, it was the <br/>
first character of their name) rather than the peacetime Tachibana <br/>
(flower) standard on the large screen in the courtyard. Thus, when <br/>
the screen is covered in blood from a fallen Ii retainer, the good <br/>
name of the Ii has also been symbolically stained with blood.<br/>
2)The Ii were renowned for their zeal and steadfastness both in <br/>
battle (seen when disobeying orders to be the first into battle at <br/>
Sekigahara, and using their orders to keep the besieged Osaka castle <br/>
under control as an excuse to bombard the castle) and in supporting <br/>
the Tokugawa (`the establishment'). This made them perfect for being <br/>
the symbol of the `unfair powers that be'.<br/>
3)The Ii were accused (in the person of Ii Naosuke) of being too <br/>
strict and cruel in dealing with anti-government factions during the <br/>
Bakumatsu era (about 230 years after the time period Hara-kiri was <br/>
set in). This formed the basis for the events in the film Samurai <br/>
Assassination. Personally, I've always felt it was a bum rap. Naosuke <br/>
was trying his best to bring Japan into the modern era while still <br/>
keeping its national identity, but the many factions pulling in <br/>
different directions made it a near impossible job. This helped to <br/>
give the Ii clan a `bad guy' image.<br/>
I've always found the story of Ii Naomasa fascinating. It reads like <br/>
a movie. His father was murdered when Naomasa was a child, leaving <br/>
him the last of his clan. He was sheltered, protected, and brought to <br/>
adulthood by his aunt, a Buddhist nun who assumed the leadership of <br/>
the clan and brooked no nonsense during his childhood (sometimes even <br/>
dressing as a man to command the respect of those she had to deal <br/>
with). He became one of the `4 Pillars Of Tokugawa' (in most <br/>
reckonings) and received the wound that eventually killed him while <br/>
engaged in battle with one of the few clans that were the martial <br/>
equals of the Ii (the Shimazu). Interestingly enough, Tokugawa Ieyasu <br/>
blamed that famous suit of armor for being the cause of the wound.</div>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1304291239">Interesting that in Joan Mellen's analysis of SEPPUKU in her WAVES ON<br/>
GENJI'S SHORE (I believe that's the title; my memory is not always very<br/>
good). She goes on to speculate about how some real-life ronin "avenged"<br/>
Tsugumo Hanshiro (the main character, played by Nakadai)'s death a few<br/>
centuries later when Ii Naosuke was assasinated.<br/>
 <br/>
However... as a historian, Joan Mellen really needs to stick to<br/>
movie-critiquing. I've also read about the assasination of Ii Naosuke and it<br/>
has absolutely nothing about poor, impoverished ronin rising up against the<br/>
rich ruling class. Not at all. The assasination was done by some<br/>
anti-Tokugawa pro-Emperor forces who wished to enforce their motto of<br/>
"Revere the Emperor, Expel the Barbarians" ("Sonno-Joi"). These<br/>
anti-Tokugawa forces were exponents of keeping a strict feudalism, they just<br/>
thought that the Tokugawas, in wanting to open up the country for trade,<br/>
weren't being strict enough in being feudal. <br/>
 <br/>
The only forces in the bakumatsu wars who wanted to bring any sort of<br/>
democracy to the common people (which would include poor, starving ronin)<br/>
was Sakamoto Ryoma. Who I find to be one of the most fascinating people of<br/>
the bakumatsu era. He and his forces were not at all involved in the<br/>
assassination of Ii Naosuke as far as I know. <br/>
 <br/>
An aside on cinema: in the new Criterion release of SEPPUKU ("HaraKiri")<br/>
Joan Mellen has an essay included. I think she learned her lesson and her<br/>
new essay has no references to the assassination of Ii Naosuke.<br/>

3)The Ii were accused (in the person of Ii Naosuke) of being too <br/>
strict and cruel in dealing with anti-government factions during the <br/>
Bakumatsu era (about 230 years after the time period Hara-kiri was <br/>
set in). This formed the basis for the events in the film Samurai <br/>
Assassination. Personally, I've always felt it was a bum rap. Naosuke <br/>
was trying his best to bring Japan into the modern era while still <br/>
keeping its national identity, but the many factions pulling in <br/>
different directions made it a near impossible job. This helped to <br/>
give the Ii clan a `bad guy' image.<br/>
I've always found the story of Ii Naomasa fascinating. It reads like <br/>
a movie. His father was murdered when Naomasa was a child, leaving <br/>
him the last of his clan. He was sheltered, protected, and brought to <br/>
adulthood by his aunt, a Buddhist nun who assumed the leadership of <br/>
the clan and brooked no nonsense during his childhood (sometimes even <br/>
dressing as a man to command the respect of those she had to deal <br/>
with). He became one of the `4 Pillars Of Tokugawa' (in most <br/>
reckonings) and received the wound that eventually killed him while <br/>
engaged in battle with one of the few clans that were the martial <br/>
equals of the Ii (the Shimazu). Interestingly enough, Tokugawa Ieyasu <br/>
blamed that famous suit of armor for being the cause of the wound.<br/>

However, I have handled several historical sets in the mid-to-low 90 lb range, so 120 would not be out of the question.</div>

 </span></blockquote>That sounds ludicrously heavy. Absolutely INSANELY heavy.<br/>
<br/>
If I remember the number correctly, according to Sakakibara Kozan the <br/>
average cuirass ("breast-and-back plates" for folks in Riolinda) in the <br/>
sengoku period weighed 15 to 21 pounds* (lighter than earlier, scale <br/>
armours with full lacing), the helmet 3 1/2 to 4 1/2 (plus another 3/4 <br/>
for the shikoro), the kote averaging 1 to 2 pounds each, haidate at <br/>
about 5 to 6 pounds and suneate at about a pound each.<br/>
<br/>
There is no WAY Japanese armour ever weighed 120 pounds.<br/>
<br/>
Even the bullet-proof stuff.<br/>

 <br/>
I stand corrected. Just out of idle curiousity, do you have a general idea of what the heaviest armor you have worked with was? I imagine you've seen as much armor as anyone in the west.<br/>
The heaviest I've examined firsthand was an Edo period ceremonial O-Yoroi that the owner had tagged at 42.5 kg.<br/>
By contrast, my father-in-law's family armor is 19.6 kg (including the armor box).</div>
