<div id="ygrps-yiv-1505339361">Hi,<br/>
There was no hitokiri and most battles were fought between provinces claiming to be the rightful representative of the emperor.  Althought the emperor was shifting alliance as was needed and no one daimyo (province) truly represented the interests of the emperor against the shogunate.  The shogunate also claimed to be the rightful rep of the emperor.  The two main provinces were satsuma and choshu as both had large numbers of samurai (employed and not employed) and had funds to develop a fairly modern arsenal.  The shognate and these two provinces all traded with various european countries who viewed the shogunate as the rightful leaders of Japan (france) and those who viewed the provinces as countries in themselves. (England).  The provinces even went as far as developing peasant militia to battle the shogunate at the border battles in choshu.  Some battles were fought against the europeans and this lead to even bigger rifts between the shogunate and Choshu and satsuma.  Well you can read more on your own but two books that might help you are:<br/>
Sakamoto Ryoma and the meiji restoration.  By, Marius B. Jansen:  This book is a good representation of bakumatsu Japan from the point of view of a individual shishi.<br/>
Choshu in the Meiji Restoration.  By, Albert M. Craig.  This book is good for a localized outlook on the bakumatsu period and the political battles fought behind the scenes which are often more powerful than the horribly done armed battles of the period.<br/>
Hope this is helpful.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-845307438">You know I've been wondering the same thing.  I too am a fan of <br/>
the samurai X/Rurouni Kenshin saga.  It seems to me that there <br/>
is very little information about this period available (or maybe I <br/>
just don't know where to look?).  But there is hope; NHK Japan <br/>
has announced a TV drama in production based on the <br/>
Shinsengumi.  It is projected for release sometime in 2004.  I'm <br/>
not sure about a release to the US or on DVD but I'm hopeful.  A <br/>
recently released film on the subject, by director Beat Takeshi <br/>
(who also stars), is called "Gonin".  Haven't seen the film myself <br/>
but have read some reviews of it.  <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1648684404">I too am a fan of the Bakumatsu but I am embarrassed to say I have never<br/>
heard of Rurouni Kenshin. His name has come up on this list several times,<br/>
is this a computer game character?<br/>
    There are quite alot of good books in English on the subject and tons in<br/>
Japanese. There are many good films as well; Shinsengumi with Mifune,<br/>
Shinsengumi Shimatsuki with Ichikawa, Bakumatsu (the Ambitious), Goyokin<br/>
with Nakadai and Tamba. And my all time favorite Daibosatsu Toge with<br/>
Nakadai, alias Sword of Doom. The Beat Takeshi film you may be thinking of<br/>
is Gohatto (taboo), a story of homosexual desire among the Shinsengumi.<br/>
Directed by Oshima Nagisa, well worth it for the dojo and fight scenes which<br/>
are first class.<br/>
    I would do an internet search for "Samurai Video" or Video search of<br/>
Miami for most or all of these titles.<br/>
