<div id="ygrps-yiv-1564400584">Basically, you should remember that the portugueses arrived to Japan in 1543. Christianity was spreaded very quickly in the hands of the jesuits.<br/>
And soon some daimyos were converted. Maybe some of them really found truth in the western faith, but most of them accepted to become baptized in order to get economical advantages in their deals with the portugueses.<br/>
Whatever the reason was, obviuosly, when the lord was baptized soon all their retainers followed his example. In that way, in fact, most of the catholic samurais (there were not protestant samurais) become christian only because it was his duty toward his lord. Some few exceptions exist anyway.<br/>
And when the Tokugawa regime banned the christianity the vast majority of them just changed their faith as soon as his lord changed.<br/>
The few ones that chose to persist in their beliefs (samurais and farmers) were persecuted and most of them were indeed baptized in blood (martyrized).<br/>

<h3>Inada vs. Hachisuka on Awaji Island</h3>
by <i>steven_matsheshu</i>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-965417215">Kitsuno,<br/>
<br/>
      Remember how I was asking about "Nojiri" ?  I<br/>
was wondering if you knew anything about a rebellion<br/>
that happened on Awaji island in 1870-ish that<br/>
involved the Inada-branch Hachisuka Clan vs. The Main<br/>
Hachisuka Branch from the Shikoku mainland. Some<br/>
Nojiri were involved and I think they were the<br/>
ancestors of my present day family .. (emphasis : "I<br/>
think".. not fully proven yet).<br/>
<br/>
     Do you know anything about this ?<br/>
<br/>
         Thanks.<br/>
<br/>
             <br/>
