Although my English is pretty good {for a Yorkshireman} I find that it is the fingers on the keyboard that let me down at times......<br/>

individuals set for themselves as each art is a basic<br/>
conclusion to open the mind to all in order to<br/>
overcome anything put in the way of true<br/>

examples of how a man or women can be more than<br/>
objects ,fear ,power over or under ,in being able to<br/>

seek a way of no boundries ,but in any lesson we learn<br/>
not just how dangerous a sword is but in are fragile<br/>
minds we must concern the utmost respect in moral<br/>
consequince of even just the sword alone as well as<br/>
our bodies ,but most of all our minds. there is no<br/>
specific way to handle any fight but to keep in mind<br/>

god believers or any miraculous accomplishment of a<br/>
body how can anyone claim a place a time or race into<br/>
reality,for it is the other way around.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1691089255">This is a group to discuss the history of samurai, NOT martial arts <br/>
or philosophy in general or the best way to live your life or Zen or <br/>
flower arrangement or bike maintenance or ...<br/>
The expression "Bushido" or "Way of the Warrior" cropped up sometimes <br/>
now, and I would like to ask a question, which might even be relevant <br/>
to the topic of this group:<br/>
Did it ever occur to you that the term bushido is not one definite <br/>
thing but changes its meaning with the text you are using? Yamaga <br/>
Soko wrote different things about bushido than Daidoji Yuzan or <br/>
Yamamoto Tsunetomo. And Nitobe Inazo's discussion of bushido is again <br/>
different. As a matter of fact, the term "bushido" was not even used <br/>
very much before the end of the 19th century, when there was no <br/>
warrior class any more. All authors who write on bushido are saying a <br/>
lot of similar things, but when you read the details, where they <br/>
differ, you notice that they had rather different thoughts on this <br/>
matter. <br/>
I would really like to read your impressions on this.<br/>
<br/>
Regards,<br/>
Max<br/>
