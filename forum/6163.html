<h3>Japan Eras</h3>
by <i>dodu_gabriel</i>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-37481972">Hello everybody!<br/>
 <br/>
I have long thought whether to "break the silence" and ask something, seeing as newcomers (newbies) are not always welcome and especially because english is not my native language...I know, I am easily intimidated...not good for me, but emotions are hard to control (I read somewhere on the forum that it's good to "grow a thick skin", so I am growing one :) ). I came across samurai-archives.com by browsing the web in search of Japan related stuff, I have subscribed to the forum and have been reading the discussions for approximately 2 weeks now.<br/>
 Anyway, since I am digressing, I'll get to the point. I would like to know the chronologic order of the japanese eras, eventually before Heian Period, and up untill The Meiji Restoration, at least the most important ones, since I understand that an era would have started and ended whenever a personality (daimyo, general or military prominent person) would have realised something extraordinary (please correct me if I am wrong...I realise the probability that I am is high, so any correction would be whole heartedly welcome). I am asking this because I need a sort of "backbone" from which I can learn more.<br/>
Oh, and another thing, I would like to learn the japanese language, but for a self-taught like myself it seems almost impossible. Seeing that I am from the Eastern Europe, and books about Japan hardly get here (on-line shopping is out of the question for now, because, for example, Amazon does not cover my area - and also because I am somehow "financially-challenged" at the moment :D ), I mostly use the www. So, here is a list of sites that I use, please tell me if they are ok:<br/>
1. Jeffrey's Japanese-English Dictionary Server at www.solon.org (EDICT)<br/>
2. Jim Breen's Japanese Page<br/>
3. Nagasaki University Old Picture Database<br/>
4. www.kanjisite.com<br/>
These are my "personal favorites", if I can call them that.<br/>
 <br/>
I would also appreciate if you could direct me to some online japanese literature books (public domain, of course), since I can't buy any ( I know I ask much...but, hey, hope dies last...)<br/>
 <br/>
This beeing said, I thank you for your time and expect your answers<br/>
 <br/>
Respectfully,<br/>
 <br/>
Gabriel<br/>

<h3>Japan Eras</h3>
by <i>dodu_gabriel</i>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-905460711">Hello again!<br/>
 <br/>
I beg my forgiveness, but at about 10 minutes from sending my first mail to you, I came cross what I was looking for, and I would like to know if it is accurate:<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
Heian Period (794-1185) <br/>
The samurai's importance and influence grew during the Heian Period, when powerful landowners hired private warriors for the protection of their properties. Towards the end of the Heian Period, two military clans, the Minamoto and Taira, had grown so powerful that they seized control over the country and fought wars for supremacy against each other. <br/>
Kamakura Period (1192-1333) <br/>
In 1185, the Minamoto defeated the Taira, and Minamoto Yoritomo established a new military government in Kamakura in 1192. As shogun, the highest military officer, he became the ruler of Japan. <br/>
Muromachi Period (1333 - 1573) <br/>
During the chaotic Era of Warring States (sengoku jidai, 1467-1573), Japan consisted of dozens of independent states which were constantly fighting each other. Consequently, the demand for samurai was very high. Between the wars, many samurai were working on farms. Many of the famous samurai movies by Kurosawa take place during this era. <br/>
Azuchi-Momoyama Period (1573 - 1603) <br/>
When Toyotomi Hideyoshi reunited Japan, he started to introduce a rigid social caste system which was later completed by Tokugawa Ieyasu and his successors. Hideyoshi forced all samurai to decide between a life on the farm and a warrior life in castle towns. Furthermore, he forbade anyone but the samurai to arm themselves with a sword. <br/>
Edo Period (1603 - 1868) <br/>
According to the Edo Period's official hierarchy of social castes, the samurai stood at the top, followed by the farmers, artisans and merchants. Furthermore, there were hierarchies within each caste. All samurai were forced to live in castle towns and received income from their lords in form of rice. Masterless samurai were called ronin and caused minor troubles during the early Edo Period. <br/>
With the fall of Osaka Castle in 1615, the Tokugawa's last potential rival was eliminated, and relative peace prevailed in Japan for about 250 years. As a result, the importance of martial skills declined, and most samurai became bureaucrats, teachers or artists.<br/>
<br/>
P.S.: this is from japan-guide.com, a site which I have just discovered.<br/>
<br/>
Thank you<br/>
<br/>
Respectfully,<br/>
<br/>
Gabriel<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Newbies are welcome unless they make themselves<br/>
unwelcome. As for English not being your native<br/>
language--YOU are the one that all these other people<br/>
must be learning to hate. Your writing skills were<br/>
QUITE good--if it's not your native language, then<br/>
THEY have no excuse. WELCOME!!!! (and so that we know,<br/>
what is your native language?) <br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Ooh, that's a toughie. You are referring to year<br/>
periods, I assume? There are a lot of them. The best<br/>
list I know of is here:<br/>
<br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://home.earthlink.net/~steinrl/kanji/nengo.htm">http://home.earthlink.net/~steinrl/kanji/nengo.htm</a><br/>
<br/>
That only begins in year 1201, but does give the kanji<br/>
for each period, and the alternate periods. I'll see<br/>
if I can dig up anything prior to that. As for<br/>
changing the period name, it was the Emperor who did<br/>
that--not the daimyo, Shogun, or any military person.<br/>
Someone else may have "suggested" to the Emperor that<br/>
it would be a good time for a name change, but it was<br/>
the Emperor who actually did it. Reasons for changing<br/>
included a portentous sign, a natural disaster, a<br/>
particularly good event, or just because they'd gone<br/>
long enough. <br/>
<br/>

the year naming system. Well, at least you found it! <br/>

Impressive.  Your English is excellent.  Are you sure you're not a "ringer" posting from middle Ohio?  You made me look up "concatenates."  I think I heard the word used ONCE back in 1992.  <br/>
<br/>
To the crowd at large, not just our erudite Romanian, I could be wrong, but my ex-wife's aiee (sword) teacher (no, dear reader, I have no idea how it is spelled, since I have never ever seen it in print) told me that the great sword makers had stopped making katanas and moved into making kitchen knives, since that's where the money is.  Now, I can see perhaps where it would be extra handy to have a ginsu knife for chopping garlic instead of your trusty katana, but maybe that's just me.  Some of you might enjoy the garlic chopping with a larger blade.  Some of you might be a little unhinged if you do, since that strikes me (ha) as a foolish approach.  So, is there any truth to this rumor that the great swordmakers are still out there, just making steak knives for Williams Sonoma?

I don't know much, so an expert's opinion would be most welcome. I <br/>
like the www.toledoswords.com site, mostly because it's one of the <br/>
few I have visited (so I only know about their opinion). Is it ok?<br/>
 Oh, and don't be afraid, as I have no intention on getting freaky, I <br/>
just like to learn about the historical events that have taken place <br/>
throughout the world, and in that matter the Discovery Channel has <br/>
been of great help ;)<br/>

Your excellent suggestion yielded some websites of interest, <br/>
particularly Mr. Sinclair's articles at <br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.geocities.com/alchemyst/history.htm">http://www.geocities.com/alchemyst/history.htm</a><br/>
in which the past and current Japanese Ni-honto are discussed. <br/>
<br/>
Interestingly, he explains in that particular article the whole 24 <br/>
swords a year standard and from what it sprung, and who regulates <br/>
the entire sword making trade in Japan, and so on.  It also gave me <br/>
some insights on the folks who claim to have a "Japanese Samurai <br/>
Sword from World War Two."  According to Mr. Sinclair, 90% of Showa <br/>
swords are, essentially, little more than mass-produced blades, <br/>
which is a pity.  <br/>

I didn't intend the garlic remark as a joke!  I was merely thinking of what I commonly do with kitchen knives, and one of them is chopping garlic for a good soffrito, after you've cooked the onions in oil to a nice pale transparency (because the onions need to cook longer than the garlic).  No cross necessary for that.  The whole vampire myth- vampires wouldn't last a week in Italy, would they?<br/>
 <br/>
Now, why would sword makers be limited in their production of fine blades each year?  Is it a law?  And what would be the purpose of that law, beyond artificially driving the price of each sword up?  It sounds like a protectionist Japanese law, sort of like how DeBeers limits the sales of diamonds to artifically drive up the price.<br/>

Hello Matt!<br/>
<br/>
Funny garlic thingy there...:)) I think there should have been a <br/>
cross also. But leaving this aside (I hope this type of utterance is <br/>
permitted in english), the katana stuff was only inteded as a joke, <br/>
as I was reading a lot of "bollocks" (as Mr. Bryant said once) on <br/>
other forums regarding the Samurai matter.<br/>
<br/>
By the way, are you familiar with the Toledo Swordmasters (the <br/>
spanish Toledo, because there are others)? They have some very nice <br/>
replicas (is that the word?) of historical swords.<br/>

Tony<br/>
 caravelles Were just being replaced out as you say tony, but portuguese trade post in africa were still actively using them due to the adapted sail (which i think was arabic in origin) which allowed the ship to sail headlong. Galleons became the norm ,and it bacame a kind of arms race in europe to see whom could build the largest and most decorative. Id imagine the sight of these highly decorated and large craft to indiginous peoples would be a sign of strength as well as a practical use. But as you say there maybe be a combination of both galleon and caravelles so it would be intresting to look at the early galleons to see if they retain any features of the caravelle. james willis aka not james wilson lol lizzie<br/>

And no, I'm not in the Marines. I still have all my<br/>
brain matter, and no lobotomy scars--that would mar my<br/>
beautifully round bald head. I'm in the Army. <br/>

updating needed, the articles I found to be quite excellent and interesting<br/>

No,,,, NO... No! In fact, this word, "concatenates"<br/>
has been used even after 1992.<br/>
<br/>
In one of proofs of theorems in Munkres' 'Introduction<br/>
to Topology', you may find word, "concatenates" used.<br/>
In complex analysis, in description and a proof of<br/>
'analytic continuation', we can also find word,<br/>
"concatenates" used.<br/>
