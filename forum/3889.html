<div id="ygrps-yiv-367387186">I've just bought a copy of the latest Military Illustrated magazine (March<br/>
2004), mainly because it contained an article by Turnbull on the use of<br/>
cannon in 16th century Japan. Great I thought! However a few paragraphs into<br/>
the article it all seemed a bit familiar and I got the distinct impression<br/>
that I'd read it all before. On checking, I found that it is taken,<br/>
virtually word for word or paragraph for paragraph from Turnbull's new book<br/>
'Samurai: The World of the Warrior'. Even the photographs are virtually<br/>
identical (just different angles) to those reproduced in the book! Turnbull<br/>
has changed a few words here and there or added a few new sentences, but the<br/>
article really adds nothing at all to the chapter in the Osprey book. So<br/>
unless you want the magazine for the other non-Japanese articles, save your<br/>
money (3.40 or $5.95) and spend it wisely elsewhere!<br/>
This is not the first time that a whole chapter of Turnbull's work has been<br/>
republished in a magazine and at least the second time that Military<br/>
Illustrated has done this - so it's definitely a case of 'buyer beware' when<br/>
purchasing!<br/>
