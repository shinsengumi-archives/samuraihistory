<h3>yoshitsune the legend grows stronger</h3>
by <i>timssinned</i>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1731588386">now the nhk taiga drama is based on the story of yoshitsune.for the <br/>
first time in many years a lot of japanese where really intrested <br/>
again in watching what they call national tv program.<br/>
now the are in the episode´s of the battle clashes between the taira <br/>
and genji.now people are getting dissatisfied because it becomes <br/>
really fictionary.in all the story´s i read about these myth i never <br/>
ever read what is making a lot of japanese talk about.<br/>
the death of yoshitsune and his grave.<br/>
the takeda´s are related to the genji and still today they have many <br/>
schools where you can practice their old traditional war <br/>
diciplines.one speciality is the riding bowman.at full speed they <br/>
fire their bows on targets while they are riding on special equal <br/>
stepping horses.<br/>
these horses are being mentioned in european historybooks on the <br/>
reason why the european knights where unable to stop the mongolian <br/>
invasion.<br/>
strangely it is very common in japan that people think that <br/>
yoshitsune went to the country with the great rivers(china).it is <br/>
also weird that the mongolians only had two great leaders and that <br/>
genghis has the same meaning as yoshitsune in japanese.the japanese <br/>
believe that genghis was yoshitsune and all the above can piont out <br/>
it could be true. it could also explain why and how the mongolians <br/>
knew how to invade japan and knew the locations to land.i would like <br/>
to know what you think or heard about this?????</div>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1459734981">While the Takeda ryu is one of the last groups practicing yabusame <br/>
(mounted archery), the horse information is incorrect. Native japanese <br/>
horses have become extremely rare (one breed is down to 1 remaining <br/>
stallion). Almost all yabusame today is practiced with retired thoroghbreds <br/>
as they are more readily avaiable. The thoroughbreds being bigger (and <br/>
faster) while the course has been maintained at the traditional length is , <br/>
IMO, the reason one rarely sees multiple hits at yabusame demos.<br/>
