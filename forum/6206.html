<br/>
Heh.  You too, eh?  Well, that's sure the effect it has when you've read it.<br/>
But it sounds better coming from you than if I'd said that.  A delightful<br/>
book.  (The somewhat endless sequels are fun as well, but none of them hold<br/>
a candle to the first.)<br/>
<br/>
Interesting that you did a paper on him - as soon as I wrote that about the<br/>
quality of Saberhagen's research, I thought - "O Gods - there's some Tony<br/>
out there who's going to nail my ignorance here!"  (I know more about the<br/>
Turks than I do about the Romanians, and while _Tape_ fit into that picture<br/>
pretty credibly, still, it was a stretch.)<br/>

Holmes-Dracula File" -- "An Old Friend of the Family" was good, too. "Thorn," I <br/>
thought, was not the strongest in the series...<br/>

fellow, Vlad Tepes kinda has to be a standout. :)<br/>

I think you should visit the following site: <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.geocities.com/romaniancoins/history.html">http://www.geocities.com/romaniancoins/history.html</a><br/>
I'll help.It's got nothing to do with Romanian Coins.It's the whole history of Romania.<br/>
