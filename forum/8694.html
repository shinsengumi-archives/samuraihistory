<div id="ygrps-yiv-1542376821">We are delighted to announce the launch of Kyushu and Okinawa Studies'<br/>

history of Kyushu and Okinawa and featuring major academic contributors.<br/>
<br/>
Title: Gateway or Gatekeeper?<br/>
Central participants:  Bruce Batten, Obirin University, Japan and Wang<br/>
Zhenping, Nanyang Technological University, Singapore.<br/>
Subject:  Medieval communication between Kyushu and the Asian continent.<br/>
Date:  May 1st to May 7th, 2006.<br/>
Participation: The forum is open to anyone who wished to register and<br/>
participate: specialist, student or amateur.<br/>
Location: www.kostudies.com/forum<br/>
<br/>
Introduction: Two myths dominate the story of Japan's relationship<br/>
with the outside world. The first and most common is that Japan was an<br/>
isolated country, opened by the arrival of Commodore Perry. The second<br/>
compares Japan to an oyster, because the foreign influence that it<br/>
accepted was no bigger than a grain of sand.<br/>
<br/>
In recent years, those myths have come under attack from researchers<br/>
studying medieval communication between Kyushu and the Asian<br/>
continent. We are delighted to announce the participation of two<br/>
authors whose work details a far richer and more complex environment.<br/>
Professors Batten and Wang describe a time in which pirates,<br/>
diplomats, traders, monks and soldiers sailed to and from Japan.<br/>
<br/>
Much of this scholarship is new. For example, Professor Batten<br/>
examines the KÃ´rokan, the official guest-house for foreign visitors,<br/>
which was located in Hakata, now located inside the modern-day city of<br/>
Fukuoka. A thousand years ago, most visitors to Japan would have<br/>
arrived by ship at Hakata Bay, the one and only authorized gateway to<br/>
Japan.  For years the site was buried underneath the city's baseball<br/>
stadium and only in recent years, after the demolition of the stadium,<br/>
has the evidence been unearthed. Professor Wang also utilizes recent<br/>
archaeological findings and little-known archival material to come to<br/>
new conclusions about relations between Japan and the outside world.<br/>
<br/>
Professor Batten approaches the topic by covering the history of<br/>
Hakata from 500 C.E. into the medieval period. He has chapters<br/>
focusing on war, diplomacy, piracy, and trade. Professor Batten has<br/>
spent his professional career focusing on Kyushu and has had access to<br/>
the latest archaeological discoveries in the area. Chapter 4 of this<br/>
book, "Gateway to Japan", available to visitors of this symposium,<br/>
focuses on a single case study. By focusing on the particularly<br/>
well-documented case of a Chinese junk that arrived in Hakata in 945,<br/>
Professor Batten showcases many of his findings, including those on<br/>
immigration, trade and official attitudes toward the outside world.<br/>
<br/>
Professor Wang's focus is on diplomatic relations and a series of<br/>
important embassies sent from the Japanese islands to Sui and Tang<br/>
China. Wang explains in detail the rigorous criteria of the Chinese<br/>
and Japanese courts in the selection of diplomats and how the two<br/>
prepared for missions abroad. He journeys with a party of Japanese<br/>
diplomats from their tearful farewell party to hardship on the high<br/>
seas to their arrival amidst the splendors of Yangzhou and Changan and<br/>
the Sui-Tang court. One of his central ideas, outlined in the<br/>
introduction is that the traditional view of China's tributary system<br/>
is oversimplistic. He argues that it was not a unilateral tool of<br/>
hegemony but a more complex situation in which multiple partners were<br/>
able to modify the rules depending on the times and circumstances.</div>
