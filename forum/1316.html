<h3>Chi tenjo</h3>
by <i>homitsu</i>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-93689400">Hello! I just joined this list. Visited two temples in Kyoto last <br/>
summer (Koshoji and Genko-an) that had ceilings built from the <br/>
floorboards of Fushimi castle, stained with the blood of those who <br/>
died in the siege in 1600. I was very affected by the sight, could <br/>
almost hear the screams and clash of arms. I understand that there <br/>
are several other temples with the same and that the castle was <br/>
dismantled with parts of it incorporated into others all over Japan. <br/>
I have a number of (maybe dumb)questions I haven't been able to find <br/>
answers for which you all may know:<br/>
<br/>
*The castle was built by Toyotomi and I read that he died there (not <br/>
in the siege of course). Is that true and was he using it as his <br/>
residence at the time? Has it ever been determined what he died of?<br/>
<br/>
*How many people on each side died in the siege?<br/>
<br/>
*What other campaigns did Torii Mototada, the castle's defender, <br/>
fight in? <br/>
     That's enough for now-thanks-homitsu</div>
