<div id="ygrps-yiv-763240338">Speaking of esoteric Sengoku knowledge, I just saw a Japanese TV show recorded <br/>
sometime last year that had two brothers who were about age 12 or 13, who were <br/>
experts on Sengoku history, they had memorized every single little detail.  Among <br/>
other things, they were able to rattle off all of Oda Nobunagas aunts, uncles, <br/>
brothers, and sisters, and knew who was adopted by who and knew both the titles <br/>
and adopted names of pretty much anyone you could think of.  They had them up <br/>
against random people on the street, then college-level history students and <br/>
eventually up against a professor of Sengoku history at Shizuoka university.  They <br/>
knew the sengoku inside out, but lost to the professor by one question - one of <br/>
the only questions I actually knew the answer to...!  The question was:  What was <br/>
the original full name of the warrior who lead the battle against Mori Motonari at <br/>
the battle of Itsukushima? (Sue Takafusa).  Although the two kids stumped the <br/>
professor after the little competition with the following question:<br/>
<br/>
"What was the biggest event of 1601?"<br/>
<br/>
Think about it, then check the answer below:<br/>

sense" was Masamune -- but that's not what happened to his eye (despite what one <br/>

  The only reason I scored full was because the only possible answer that "made <br/>

<h3>Date origins...and locals...</h3>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-912490656">Konnichi wa, tomodachi...<br/>
O genki desuka?<br/>
I am very interesed in the historic origins of the Date clan-<br/>
Who were their relatives by blood?<br/>
Who were their relatives by marriage?<br/>
The Date seem to have been one of those clans that were <br/>
notable enough to register, yet seemed not to contribute to any of <br/>
the major recorded actions...<br/>
What were their domains of residence, and the places they <br/>
migrated? I know they vaguely lived in the Mutsu/Dewa regions, <br/>
and I know they also spread southward, but wha specific kuni <br/>
did they reside in?<br/>
How early did they start to show up in histories or writings? <br/>
Whom were they allied to in the pre-sengoku jidai?<br/>
OK - lots of questions...plenty of room for answers...<br/>
Domo arigato...<br/>

<h3>Trying to learn</h3>
by <i>goodfella26426</i>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1500046492">Tony, not to dispute you, but why was your response about the officers considering themselves samurai incorrect?? In WWI, the cavalry still consisted of horses, but by WWII, the cavalry was tanks and such.. if yor in a tank w/ a biiiiiiiiig cannon on the front, whats the point of a sword?? hence why the sword became a dress item, it no longer had a functional purpose.. However I have seen many pictures in textbooks and on the history channel and such showing the Japanese at prison camps using the swords to behead POWs.. I also heard on the history channel that they did consider themselves samurai, even tho they knew they werent.. So I jsut wondered what else you had to say about the subject and where you got your info.. I am, unfortunately, notorious for not having specific referrences, sorry I cant supply any..<br/>

and Noda in Nanking, who competed to see how many Chinese heads could <br/>
chop in a day (for fun...). Nonetheless, there is NO sufficient <br/>
documentation to prove the story was true (Iris Chang says is true, but <br/>
it is very debatable). One of the arguments to disimiss the story as a <br/>
lie says that it would need quite a few katana to chop several heads. <br/>
The count was supposedly 106 to 105 for Mukai.<br/>
Anyway, I hope I did not open a can of worms. Horrible things happened <br/>
in Nanking, we all know that.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1069625769">In regard to whether the WW2 officers in the Imperial Army considered themselves 'samurai', I would like to add a specific example of my neighbour in Hiroshima. Over rather a few tokkuri of warm sake in recent months he has been regaling me with stories of when he served in Manchuria, much as my grandfather did with his stories from North Africa, Italy, the Middle East and India. He clearly found that while officers were more than often not of samurai stock, but considered themselves the successors of that class, perhaps in a similar manner to which many yakuza consider themselves modern samurai.<br/>
So why did they carry swords? Why do officers in many officers around the world carry swords? If you view the photographs of the carnage on the Western Front during WW1 you will still see officers leading their troops sword in hand. Why? Distinction.  Still, the officer has to be seen as superior to his/her men/women (not to be accused of sexism) and the sword is an obvious symbol universally of such a principle.  A man with a sword has always ranked higher than one with a spear or musket.<br/>

<h3>R: [samuraihistory] Trying to learn</h3>
by <i>Carlo Tacchini</i>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1393937847">As officers in western armies link (even now) themselves to the western<br/>
''knights'' with the carring of a cavalry sword, so the japanese<br/>
officers linked (no more after WWII) themselves to ''their'' knights,<br/>
incidentally Samurai. In XVIII century western officers still whore<br/>
gorgets (totally useless) as a symbol of their status.<br/>
Is a matter of idealistic symbolism. During the Meiji Era there were not<br/>
katana mounting in japanese army but only and totally ''western''<br/>
mounting. Still remained the link with the ''knights'' ideals. Later,<br/>
when nationalism rised (too much), a sort of strange ''Tachi'' mounting<br/>
replaced the westerns one.   <br/>

I am taking a graduate seminar on Modern Japanese history, and I am <br/>
sure the above will be a big issue for discussion. I'll keep you posted <br/>

<h3>Re: [samuraihistory] Trying to learn</h3>
by <i>nihontonut</i>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-258310674">In addition to the reasons allready mentioned is the fact that they were<br/>
actually used in combat. Of the officers and nco's,<br/>
(the people who actually took swords into battle in WW2) many of them had<br/>
training in iado, kendo and kenjutsu. They complained that the kyugunto, a<br/>
western style saber used during the Russo-Japanese war until the mid 1930s<br/>
was to brittle and inflexable for combat and it also did not allow for a two<br/>
handed grip. Also there were strong nationalistic feelings at the time and<br/>
many people thought that they should be using there own swords instead of<br/>
copying an inferior western style. at the time of WW2 an officer could<br/>
purchase a machine made sword, or for extra cost he could order a handmade<br/>
one. In addition many officers were decended from samurai and many family<br/>
swords were remounted in military mounts and taken to war. I am sure there<br/>
was a great deal of pride in taking great grandads sword to war.(some of<br/>
which had family mons on the mounts)<br/>
I dont think they thought the were samurai, but I am sure that they saw<br/>
themselves in a similer light, same ideals and values anyway.(When they<br/>
asked a group of fighter pilots if anyone would fly a plane into a ship the<br/>
response was allways almost 100% YES!!) I have couple of WW2 mounted swords,<br/>
one is late war poor quality and machine made, the other dates from the mid<br/>
1500s. And both show evidence of actual use in combat in WW2.<br/>

completely different things, as I'm sure you know.<br/>
This debate keeps getting more and more ridiculous. <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1627906374">Because the general deafening consensus is that not only are there no samurai and that it's an absurd thought to even ponder but that no one, even Japanese with samurai ancestorage would consider themselves samurai. All ties to the the class of samurai had been legally severed. Why take a chance of validating a soldier's claim to that status by bringing back the "soul of the samurai"? In essence the Japanese government was reinstating the rank of samurai without the class or privileges by letting them carry swords again. A person might humbly say that they are not samurai but in their heart of hearts they feel they are and that no matter what the government says they still remain samurai.<br/>
 Now on the darker side:<br/>
There was a military uprising in the 1970's by a general who wanted to go back to the days of Imperial japan and reinstate the class of samurai by force. But only a handful of soldiers joined him. Everyone else shouted him down as a crazy man. He committed Sepeku as a result of his failure.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1039873874">Hi,<br/>
<br/>
Tjhough I really love his fiction (albeit in translation beacuse his use of <br/>
now-obscure kanji in his prose gives me a headache), the "general" of whom <br/>
you speak was Mishima Yukio.  He had formed a private "army" (I forget the <br/>
size, but it was small and not officially part of the Civil Defense Forces) <br/>
called the Tate no kai or "Shield Society."  It is hard to call what he did <br/>
on that day in 1970 a true uprising becuase he had, like, only 10 guys <br/>
(from his Shield Society) and it can be argued that he took a hostage <br/>
merely to be allowed to speak.  Mishima could be described as a bit of a <br/>
hedonist and loved to be the center of attention from all accounts.  <br/>
Incidentally, his seppuku, which was botched all to hell and a second <br/>
kaishaku had to finish the job of taking his head, seems to have been the <br/>
plan all along.  He made sure that morning that his affairs were in order <br/>
and sent off to the the publisher the last manuscript of his Tetralogy.<br/>
<br/>
In any event, I don't think that this can be considered a true military <br/>
uprising since he was not part of the military, had no weapons of note and <br/>
clearly did not expect to take the day as he had prepared for his death.  <br/>
Also, if you read his short book _Sun and Steel_ he outlines in it his <br/>
beliefs about unifying life and art and about the merits of dying while <br/>
still young and beautiful.<br/>
<br/>
For what it's worth.<br/>

Yukio, card carrying whacko, who harrangued the army at Japan's military HQ. No <br/>

 </span></blockquote>No, there wasn't. There was a WRITER (not a general),<br/>
Mishima Yukio, who was disenchanted with what post-war<br/>
Japan had become, and attempted to get the Japanese<br/>
"West Point" cadets to join him in an abortive coup<br/>
attempt. When NO ONE followed him, he committed<br/>
suicide at the Defense Academy in Ichigaya. I've stood<br/>
on the spot where he committed seppuku. Everyone<br/>
thought he was a madman because he WAS a madman. Have<br/>
you read any of his books? Whacko. <br/>

books? The only one I could finish was Kinkakuji, and<br/>
that was for a class) who acted more in a moral and<br/>
artistic protest than an attempt to really overthrow<br/>
the government or anything. That's very interesting<br/>
about the seppuku...how it was botched and so forth.<br/>
The movie about his live is very interesting, and he<br/>
was actually acting in a play at one point where his<br/>
character committed seppuku--I wonder how much he came<br/>
to associate with that character. He was clearly<br/>
mental, to say the least. <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1552397524">I can read his books because he was (and arguably still is) a very <br/>
influential Japanese fiction writer.  In order to get an idea of what was <br/>
going on in the literary circles of the later 20th century one really cant <br/>
get away without reading some Mishima (and Kawabata and Oe the Murakamis, <br/>
etc.)  On another side, it was an interesting side course for my study as I <br/>
am interested in the ways that the samurai/bushido/martial tradition in <br/>
Japan has been co-opted by people for their specific ends.  As such, <br/>
Mishima is very important.  He wrote a comment on Hagakure, he started to <br/>
lift weights and study Kendo in his 30s (as a way to exemplify bunbu <br/>
ryodou), and wrote a book called wakaki samurai no tame ni.  Insane or not, <br/>
there is much to mine their for material for research and such.  Besides <br/>
many great writers were "whacko."  Flaubert and Akutagawa come to mind.<br/>
<br/>
As for the play, it was called _Patriotism_ and a film was made of it that <br/>
had such a graphic and realistic (as far as one would guess) depiction of <br/>
seppuku that Mishima's widow had all extant copies of it (that she could <br/>
get her hands on) destroyed.  My former University has one of the few <br/>
surviving copies.   <br/>

Exactly. He was a whacko writer (how can you read his<br/>
books? The only one I could finish was Kinkakuji, and<br/>
that was for a class) who acted more in a moral and<br/>
artistic protest than an attempt to really overthrow<br/>
the government or anything. That's very interesting<br/>
about the seppuku...how it was botched and so forth.<br/>
The movie about his live is very interesting, and he<br/>
was actually acting in a play at one point where his<br/>
character committed seppuku--I wonder how much he came<br/>
to associate with that character. He was clearly<br/>
mental, to say the least.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1452377796">Hi again,<br/>
<br/>
I feel like I am always on the "other side."  I guess, though, that one of <br/>
the reasons for this forum is to spur debate.  So here goes.<br/>
<br/>
While the concept of Japanese re-militarization may be "laughable" today -- <br/>
though I disagree -- the case today is not the same as it was in 1970.  The <br/>
30+ intervening years have done much to shape the thoughts of the Japanese <br/>
(nation and people) as well as the opinions of those looking in from <br/>
without.  <br/>
<br/>
I contend that the problem sending troops is a political one.  Koizumi, <br/>
like most politicians, doesn't want to do anything unpopular with the <br/>
people and so that is why it took them so long to get off their hands.  <br/>
That this is not the only outlook in Japan is evidenced by the popularity <br/>
of Mayor Ishihara.  He has been advocating getting rid of the <br/>
non-aggression clause in the constituition (article 9 is it?) for some <br/>
time, and yet remains wildly popular.  Anyway we should note that Mishima <br/>
was not really looking for militarism, but a return to Japan's past, what <br/>
he felt made Japan uniquely Japanese.  And that, more than militarism, was <br/>
a return to reverence for the emperor and that (military) service should be <br/>
in those terms, rather than in more secular ones.<br/>
<br/>

Just as I stomached Kenzaburo Oe, who isn't<br/>
necessarily whacko, just boring. (I fully grant that<br/>
this is simply my own opinion). Murakami Haruki, on<br/>
the other hand, stands as the greatest writer of all<br/>
time (again, my opinion--not really, he's just my<br/>
FAVORITE writer of all time. Allow me a little<br/>
hyperbole.) Kawabata is VERY good and fully deserving<br/>
of the Nobel he won--I loved Yukiguni and own a copy. <br/>
<br/>
On another side, it was an interesting side<br/>

not? I believe, correct me if I'm wrong, that he felt<br/>
that masculine love was a virtue, like many samurai<br/>
did, and Ihara Saikaku (speaking of authors). <br/>

in his biography I saw, I can't remember which. It's<br/>
been too long. <br/>
<br/>
I'm not trying to debate his literary merits--he's<br/>
definitely got a place in the pantheon of Japanese, if<br/>
not world, literature. Many writers who are "great"<br/>
are writers who I wouldn't read if stranded on a<br/>
deserted island with their collected works--pick a<br/>
Russian writer and give me his name and I'll<br/>
immediately fall asleep. That's not a reflection on<br/>
their writing per se, it's a reflection on my attitude<br/>
towards their writing. As I said, I've got nothing<br/>
against Japanese modern fiction--while I think Oe<br/>
Kenzaburo and Abe Kobo are boring and I'd rather pluck<br/>
my eyelashes out, I simply LOVE Murakami Haruki,<br/>
Kawabata Yasunari, Natsume Soseki, etc. My FAVORITE<br/>
book of all time is probably either "South of the<br/>
Border, West of the Sun" or "Sputnik Sweetheart" by<br/>
Murakami or "All She Was Worth", the best mystery I've<br/>
ever read, by Miyabe Miyuki. I LOVE that book...<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Having not lived here in the 70's (I was only around<br/>
for the second half of the decade anyways) I can't<br/>
comment on that, but I will say the Japan is probably<br/>
the most adamantly pacifist country I can think of,<br/>
socially speaking. Many Japanese are barely aware of<br/>
the existence of their own Jietai, or were before the<br/>
whole Iraq deployment thing. I find it highly ironic<br/>
that the countries in Asia still get upset at visits<br/>
to Yasukuni and keep pointing to it as a leftover<br/>
vestige of militarism and a sign that Japan might "do<br/>
it again." China's CLEARLY the bigger expansionist<br/>
threat. <br/>

internationally speaking it's about time Japan got off<br/>
it's duff and did something in the world. <br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Yep, Article 9. Limiting Japan's "defense" spending<br/>
since 1954. Of course, even when they stay under 1%<br/>
(the unofficial limit--as far as I know Nakasone in<br/>
the 80's was the only one to go over that) of their<br/>
budget, it's still a huge defense expenditure compared<br/>
to many countries around the world. Japan's military<br/>
isn't huge, but it beats the pants technologically off<br/>
of just about anyone. <br/>
<br/>
  Anyway we<br/>

than me (not my area of interest, really.) The<br/>
endstate of this discussion is that we agree that the<br/>
first poster's question on this is erroneous--it<br/>
wasn't a general, it was Mishima, and it wasn't even<br/>
really a coup attempt. <br/>

is that really such a bad thing?? Im gonna have to mve to Japan in a few years.. at first I was not looking foreward to it, mostly bcos I dont speak the language.. but many ppl have been telling me I'll do just fine that they are very westernized and most ppl, especially the younger ones (in my age backet) speak english.. (on a side note, according to the NY times Wed. Oct 23, 2002.."To Grandparents english word trend isnt naissu") *hooray I actually have a refference* the Japanese are adopting English words into their own language.. History, tradition and a sense of who I am culturaly is really important to me.. so on one hand I was pretty relieved to hear that they are westernizing and that I will get along fine over there, but on the other hand, I feel sorry bcos in a way they are loosing that.. it seems Mishima was in his own....whacko little way, was just trying to point this out to ppl.. does anyone else not see this or see modern Japan as being "sell outs" in a way??<br/>

 </span></blockquote>If you don't mind, how old are you? Be careful what<br/>
you assume by "speak english"--many are familiar with<br/>
the language, can read it (mostly), but SPEAKING it is<br/>
something entirely different. Many people can speak<br/>
enough to help you find the grocery store or show you<br/>
an English menu, but I wouldn't expect in depth<br/>
conversations on astro-physics. <br/>

the Japanese are adopting English words<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>And making them Japanese. One of the hardest things<br/>
for me in Japanese is trying to figure out what the<br/>
"adopted" english word is when a Japanese says it. I<br/>
had to look up a few--"Borantia" (Volunteer) is the<br/>
example that comes to mind, but frequently the words<br/>
are used out of normal English context or are just<br/>
plain unrecognizable. <br/>

any less American because they don't wear cowboy hats<br/>
and six-shooters? Even Japan's modernization is<br/>
uniquely Japanese--I wouldn't call it "Westernizing".<br/>
For example, any of us from the West can tell you that<br/>
you walk into a Japanese McDonald's and it's a<br/>
completely DIFFERENT experience than it is in the US<br/>
or Europe. <br/>

necessarily fact. <br/>
<br/>
I find Mishima's work highly disturbing. He seems<br/>
obsessed with madness. Though I suppose no more than<br/>
Tanizaki's "Diary of a Mad old Man", which I happened<br/>
to like. <br/>

Sellouts? Adaption is a common way of all biolagical critters...but<br/>
selling out involves monetary or other similar compensation - <br/>
<br/>
Kanji - yes, they found that the Chinese had a functional writing<br/>

country did your particular writing system come from?<br/>

Buddhism - remember that they added a tollerance for other religions<br/>
that strict Buddhism from India did not espouse...<br/>
They had indigionous religious systems and simply added Buddhism to<br/>
the pile - they did not replace their religions...(I am also a<br/>
Buddhist, but that is a side note...<br/>

Airplanes - quite post-period, but if it is pertanent, I ask you off<br/>

My experience is like Nate's - many Japanese people read and write English well but do not speak at all fluently. And to be able to read Japanese opens up the country and culture to you in a way you cannot imagine.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-964734240">Christopher, Mr. Wilson didn't write what you're responding to. I did. Mr. Hazen. You seem to have blended the original post by Mr. Wilson and my response to his post, in which I was defending the Japanese as not being "sellouts" but as being skilled at adapting their culture to the times, and particularly, in taking from other cultures and improving upon them. Kanji, buddhism, airplanes, electronics, and the get-rid-of-the-samurai-and-modernize-movement are all part of that cultural quality. The japanese did not invent any of those things. They simply learned/took from other cultures and improved upon them. If you want justification for the inclusion of airplanes in that list... the americans invented the airplane, but in WWII it was the Japanese Zero that was king of the skies, not the American P-51 Mustang. As for electronics... again, Americans were at the helm of this... Thomas Edison, for example, and americans invented the computer, too. But what country makes the most/best computers? Japan. Sony and Hitachi and Toshiba generally make the best electronic equipment... TV's and computers and such. Japanese companies. Though America  has experienced a resurgence in quality with the Apple Macintosh brand, but it is still struggling with popularity. (I'm typing on a iMac right now). Similarly, who makes the most reliable engines for vehicles? It ain't Ford! Get a Honda or a Toyota, a Lexus or an Acura, if you want reliability. Same with motorcycles. The Japanese have long made the best engines... Hondas, Suzukis, Kawasakis... all way better than the old Harley Davidson (I've owned a Harley, a honda, a suzuki, and now I have a Buell... which the Buell is supposed to be an American response to the Japanese sportbike). Again, Americans invented the motorcycle, but Japan makes the best ones. Shoot, even my american made Buell has a Japanese suspension!<br/>
<br/>
Getting rid of the sword carrying Samurai class and modernizing is simply an example of that cultural adaptation.<br/>
<br/>
Hope I've explained my point well enough. As Nate responded, the Japanese aren't "sellouts" anymore than the rest of us. But if I were to make a generalized statement of opinion, I would say Americans were adventurous innovators, and the Japanese were creative assimilators. Seems like americans invent the stuff, and then the Japanese make it better. (But Macs still rule...)<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-96122536">I think that the samurai should still exist as a living link to the past, the same way that the knighthood still exists, no I am not claiming to be a knight but Sir Mick Jagger and Sir Paul Mccartney could make that claim. What if samurai existed simply as a non hereditary title without the sword wearing rights and stipends, as a way for Japan to bestow upon its citizens, recognition for personal acomplishments or service to the nation?<br/>

<br/>
  Because the general deafening consensus is that not only are there no samurai and that it's an absurd thought to even ponder but that no one, even Japanese with samurai ancestorage would consider themselves samurai. All ties to the the class of samurai had been legally severed. Why take a chance of validating a soldier's claim to that status by bringing back the "soul of the samurai"? In essence the Japanese government was reinstating the rank of samurai without the class or privileges by letting them carry swords again. A person might humbly say that they are not samurai but in their heart of hearts they feel they are and that no matter what the government says they still remain samurai.<br/>
  Now on the darker side:<br/>
  There was a military uprising in the 1970's by a general who wanted to go back to the days of Imperial japan and reinstate the class of samurai by force. But only a handful of soldiers joined him. Everyone else shouted him down as a crazy man. He committed Sepeku as a result of his failure.<br/>

  Turn the question around: Why do we in the US military<br/>
  carry cavalry sabers as our ceremonial weapons (and<br/>
  why did they carry them back in the day when they<br/>
  actually used them?) Because that's what we<br/>
  used--that's what fit with our Army. Why should the<br/>
  Japanese Army change what had worked for their culture<br/>
  for 1000 years?<br/>

bizarre, for sure. Not one of my favorites. Though A<br/>
Wild Sheep's Chase and Dance Dance Dance are<br/>
definitely screwy, and I love them. My favorites<br/>

houses/apartments that combine these three rooms.<br/>

nothing to explain it. Thanks.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Nothing is wrong with just eye-candy. She's not the<br/>
brightest girl, but then again on most of her TV<br/>
appearances Iijima Ai doesn't come across as smart<br/>
either, and she really is. I think Inoue Waka is just<br/>
as cute as can be--she's no Sawaguchi Yasuko, but then<br/>
again, no one else is. <br/>
