<h3>The Samurai Archives Yakuza Film Rundown</h3>
by <i>kitsuno</i>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-134894162">I've started a side project I wanted to let everyone know about, the Yakuza Film Rundown:<br/>
<br/>
www.yakuzafilm.com<br/>
<br/>
I'll be giving a rundown of 1-2 Yakuza films a month, which will are chosen by you, the readers - the next movie will be Takashi Miike's "Like a Dragon", which beat out "Deadly Outlaw: REKKA" and "Yakuza Demon", after which I'll have up another poll so you can vote on the next movie.  The first rundown is available - Takashi Miike's 2002 "Graveyard of Honor", as well as a post detailing the AnimEigo release and Extras DVD.  Rather than keeping it a straight review, I try to mix it up, keep it conversational, and add as many pertinent and entertaining links and images into the text as I can find, trying to give it a more "multimedia" feel. <br/>
<br/>
Look for the "Like a Dragon" rundown soon.  I hope you enjoy the blog.</div>
