Konnichi wa,<br/>
     I am a 19 year old American citizen who has always had an interest in<br/>
the Samurai and 16th century Japan.  It is not until within the last 2<br/>
years, however, that I have begun to really look into it.  I am a rather<br/>
good writer and plan to use the late Sengoku period in one of the episodes<br/>
of a series my friends and I are going to begin writing.  I wish to know<br/>
where I can get ALL of the info I need such as Historical data, Language<br/>
and systems of counting used by the people, as well as all of their<br/>
important customs.  I've read "SHOGUN" by James Clavell, but besides the<br/>
obvious renaming of historical figures such as Will Adams (James<br/>
Blackthorne in the book) and Tokugawa Ieyasu (the character Yoshi<br/>
Toranaga) a few things were kind of inaccurate and even I picked up on it<br/>
with my limited knowledge.  Things such as -san and -sama for polite<br/>
conversation and addression superiors instead of using -sama and -dono as<br/>
I understand they are the correct way of seperating politeness from<br/>
respect.  Also they said "Domo" could be used instead of "Domo Arigato" by<br/>
men to say "Thanks".  This was the first thing that caught my eye as a<br/>
problem since "Domo" means "Very much" it didn't make sense to me.  Am I<br/>
mistaken??  I wish to know how much of the counting systems given were<br/>
correct as well (a Koku is the amount of rice needed to feed 1 man for 1<br/>
year, and days are divided into 12 sets of 2 hours each and named in order<br/>
of the Oriental Zodiac, etc.)  Also the correct measurement of "Ri" is<br/>
important.  The book said it was "1 mile" the glossary of the samurai<br/>
archives said it was "2.445 miles" I'm more inclined to believe the<br/>
Archive though.  It being official and all.  Is there any other advise as<br/>
to what I should incorporate into my book and places where I could accuire<br/>
this info.  Any information that any of you could give me would be greatly<br/>
appreciated.  My intention is to make this as Historically accurate as<br/>
humanly (or Americanly ::sigh::) possible.<br/>
<br/>
P.S.  By the way, any infant can speak better Japanese than me which is a<br/>
big problem so I have a question about a certain title.  If I was to call<br/>
someone "Shogun of the Six Divine Virtues" would it be writen as "Roku<br/>
Shintoku no Shogun" or the other way around???<br/>
