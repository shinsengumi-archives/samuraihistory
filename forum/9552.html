<br/>
 </span></blockquote>A  "Budo Charter" was established on April 23, 1987 by Japanese Budo Association (Nippon Budo Shingikai).  It's introduction states:<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
Budo, rooted in the martial spirit of ancient Japan, is an aspect of traditional culture that has evolved from jyutsu to do through centuries of historical and social change.<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
Following the concept of unity of mind and technique, budo has developed and refined a discipline of austere training which promotes etiquette, skillful technique, physical strength, and the unity of mind and body. Modern Japanese have inherited these values and they play a prominent role in forming Japanese personalities. In modern Japan the budo spirit is a source of powerful energy and promotes a pleasant disposition in the individual.<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
Today, budo has been diffused throughout the world and has attracted strong interest internationally. However, infatuation with mere technical training, and undue concern with winning is a severe threat to the essence of budo. To prevent this perversion of the art, we must continually examine ourselves and endeavor to perfect and preserve this national heritage.<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
It is with this hope that we establish the BUDO CHARTER in order to uphold the fundamental principles of traditional budo.<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
MY paraphrase of this charter is:<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
Budo, literally "martial way" is rooted in the warrior spirit of ancient Japan.  It is a part of the culture of Japan that has evolved from Japanese "traditional ways and practices" (jyutsu), to become "a way to journey through life"-- a calling (do), through centuries of historical and social change.<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
Budo follows the idea of congruity of thought and action, that is, a purposeful unification of mind and physical technique.  Budo has developed and refined various disciplines of rigorous training that promote etiquette (respectful civil behavior) , skillful technique (polished and experienced action), physical strength and vigor, and the unity of mind and body (a congruous melding of the body's action with the mind's intentions). <br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
Budo has been diffused throughout the world and has attracted strong international interest. Infatuation with mere technical prowess and undue concern with winning however poses a severe threat to the basic nature of budo. To prevent this misuse of the art we must continually examine ourselves and endeavor to perfect and preserve the purposes of budo, Japan's national heritage.<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
It is with this hope that we establish the Principles of Budo in order to uphold the fundamental purposes of traditional budo.<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
Principles of Budo<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
ARTICLE 1: OBJECTIVE<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
The objective of budo is to cultivate character.  To improve the ability of the individual to make value judgments and to foster a well disciplined and capable individual, budo makes use of physical and mental training utilizing ancient and modern martial techniques.<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
ARTICLE 2: KEIKO<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
The meaning of keiko includes "to think and to practice old subjects" and implies that one must mentally purpose and physically emulate the teachings of the rigorous training undertaken.  When practicing daily one must constantly follow respectful decorum, adhere to the fundamentals of technique, and resist the temptation to merely pursue physical technical skill rather than the purposeful unification of mind and physical technique.<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
ARTICLE 3: SHIAI<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
In competition (shiai), and in the performance of basic forms training (kata), one must manifest budo spirit, exert one's self to one's maximum, win with modesty, accept defeat gracefully, and constantly exhibit temperate, self-restrained attitudes.<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
ARTICLE 4: DOJO<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
The "way place" (dojo) is a place ordained for training one's mind and body. Here one must maintain discipline, proper etiquette, and respectful formality. The training area must be a solemn, clean, safe and dignified environment.<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
ARTICLE 5: TEACHING<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
In order to be an effective teacher budo instructors should always strive to cultivate the instructor's personal character, and further the instructor's own skill and discipline of mind and body. The instructor should not be swayed by winning or losing or display arrogance about possessing any superior skill.  Rather, the instructor should retain the attitudes suitable for a budo role model.<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
ARTICLE 6: PRESENTATION<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
When presenting budo, one should follow traditional values, seek substantial training, contribute to research, and give one's total effort to perfect and preserve this traditional art.  One should also have an understanding and be mindful of varying international points of view.<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> > "Finding the way" is also a bit off the mark of MOST martial philosophies as it is not the path one is after but the destination; the paths can be many roads/ways leading to the same goal (eg. mastery of the self).<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>"Popular budo" may not seek the "way" of Budo, it may seek only the destination or acquisition of rank or technique; but a true "do" or "Way" is a life's purpose or path.  To use a western concept..."success is a journey not a destination."<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
Is Budo merely "a philosophical path in a Japanese martial tradition"?  It may be.  It may be just another technique to learn.  It may be being able to defend one's self.  It may be becoming the best at a technique.  It may be winning at all costs.  It may be seeking enlightenment through the application of the martial arts to one's daily life.  One's martial "Way" will be different for each individual.  BUT the "martial way"--budo--is a journey of discovery and not merely the acquisition of technique.  That is more properly termed a jyutsu.  One gets to determine for one's self what his "martial way" will become and what jyutsu one will study and make use of.<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
But that's just MY understanding of it.<br/>
<br/>

 <br/>
Instead of reading up on the Hagakure or worrying yourself too much<br/>
about 'bushido' in general, I'd recommend you pick up 'Taming of the<br/>
Samurai', by Eiko Ikegami. It will give you a far more accurate picture<br/>
of Edo period samurai, though it can be tough reading at times - the<br/>
first few chapters in particular.<br/>
