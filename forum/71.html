<h3>Law enforcement in Edo period Japan</h3>
by <i>JM</i>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-898566814">Hi. I hope this helps. <br/>

<br/>
The site is a translation site for the Rurouni Kenshin manga(comic),<br/>
but it has a section which deals with the Shinsengumi, a famous group<br/>
of swordmen who protected the citizens of Kyoto from the Isshinshishi(Pro-emperor radicals) during the mid-19th century. The owner of the site is very knowledgable with the said group, and you can ask him for more info should you find the content of his site insufficient.<br/>
<br/>
For my question, can anyone here provide me with more info about the Miura family? All I know about them is that they were of great help in putting the Minamoto family into power and that they were from the Kinugasa region(somewhere near Kamakura?).<br/>

RE: For my question, can anyone here provide me with more info about the <br/>
Miura family? All I know about them is that they were of great help in <br/>
putting the Minamoto family into power and that they were from the Kinugasa <br/>
region(somewhere near Kamakura?).<br/>
<br/>
The Miura claimed descent from Taira Takamochi, a son of Katsurabara-shinno <br/>
(himself a son of the Emperor Kammu).  Miura (Taira) Tamemichi established <br/>
himself at Kinugasa in the mid-11th Century. By the late-12th Century, they <br/>
were acting as vice-governors (suke) of Sagami Province.  Miura Yoshiaki <br/>
(d.1181) and his son Yoshizumi (d.1200) supported Minamoto Yoritomo from the <br/>
outset of the Gempei War, though the former was killed early in the <br/>
fighting.  After the Minamoto victory, Yoshizumi was named as one of the 13 <br/>
members of the Shukurou (or council of elders, established in 1199 to check <br/>
the power of Minamoto Yoriie).  Yoshizumi was also to evidently act as shugo <br/>
of Sagami, and the Miura would later recieve Kawachi and Kii.  Miura <br/>
Yoshimura (d.1239) thus became quite influential under the Hojo bakufu and <br/>
his family might have been the only Minamoto Gokenin capable of threatening <br/>
the Hojo's grip on Kamakura.  This, it would seem, was their undoing, for on <br/>
1247 the Hojo and Adachi family made a sudden attack on the Miura residences <br/>
and killed (or forced into suicide) some 500 members of the latter family.<br/>
Minor branches of the Miura endured, however.  The most notable of these <br/>
became powerful once again in the Muira area under the leadership of Miura <br/>
Tokitaka. He adopted his heir Yoshiatsu from the Uesugi, but when a natural <br/>
son was born to Tokitaka, he forced Yoshiatsu into the priesthood.  <br/>
Yoshiatsu suddenly rebelled and Tokitaka was attacked at Arai and killed <br/>
along with his son in 1496.  Yoshiatsu (the son of Uesugi Takamasa and also <br/>
known as Miura Dousun) established his own son Yoshimoto at Arai while he <br/>
resided in Okazaki (not to be confused with the Okazaki of Mikawa).  He <br/>
became involved in a war with Hojo Soun when the latter attacked Odawara <br/>
Castle.  Yoshiatsu allied with the uesugi but was subsequently attacked at <br/>
Okazaki and fled to Arai, which fell to the Hojo after a long siege in 1516. <br/>
  He commited suicide along with Yoshimoto (I'm not sure what became of <br/>
Yoshiatsu's 2nd son Yoshimasa - perhaps he also died at Arai).<br/>
Another branch of the Miura, descended from a grandson of Muira Yoshizumi), <br/>
was established as daimyo by the Tokugawa in 1639 in Shimotsuke Province.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>What do you want to know, they were a Taira family that sided with the Minamoto and then the Hojo, Kinugasa was their fortress and the site of several battles. A branch of this family was later made Daimyo in the Tokugawa era...<br/>
