<br/>
I believe nobody here misunderstood Christianity and Buddhism, specially me<br/>
who acknowledged many forms of christianity (was once a christian as well),<br/>
and was undergo at least three schools of buddhism (including hokkekyo,<br/>
dhyana and vajrayana).<br/>
<br/>
You don't understand buddhism at all by the other side.<br/>
The principal point of buddhism teachings is the SUFFERING of any sentient<br/>
being. Be it psychological, be it existential, be it an phisical illness.<br/>
<br/>
More research on this subject can also give buddhist roots in the oriental<br/>
and ocidental (though Hipocrates and what was before him) medicinal systems,<br/>
but it is beyond the topic and will not speak about this issue here.<br/>
<br/>
And disagreeing with mr goldman, Jesuits was not good to Japan and not good<br/>
to Brazil. Non-christian for such theology of those intolerant christian<br/>
times, was not barelly considered humans until their convertion that should<br/>
be done whatever means would be necessary, including sword-pointed<br/>
convertion.<br/>
<br/>
The Samurai Spirit is much about Honour, Loyalty (not to a fictional god but<br/>
to the Lord he and his ancestors gaves oath of allegiance) and also, the<br/>
most elevated moral values of the classical japanese culture that also<br/>
includes:<br/>
<br/>
Respect and Loyalty to the Shogun<br/>
Respect and Loyalty to his daimyo<br/>
Respect and reverence to ancestors<br/>
Reverence and respect to the family (Oyakoko)<br/>
and foremost and in no way of less importance,<br/>
reverence and devotion to the GODS of the Land.<br/>
<br/>
(and I can point SEVERAL verses in the Old and New testment that will<br/>
blasphemously against such values)<br/>
<br/>
A TRUE Samurai NEVER would convert himself to a religion that demonizes his<br/>
ancestors spirits, the Gods of his ancestors, and if he is much into Shinto,<br/>
specially due to it, the Gods that makes the Imperator (Ten no Heika), a<br/>
Holy man.<br/>
<br/>
The convertion in itself is already an act of threason desserving a sepukku!<br/>
<br/>
It is true that one must be, at least one time in his life, a buddhist, to<br/>
at least understand what buddhism is. No theoric studies can make one<br/>
understand even the superfitial aspects of such doctrine.<br/>

Let me say first off that you've misunderstood Christianity and Buddhism and<br/>
most world religions if you think that the point is simply morality. Sure,<br/>
most religions have a system of morality, but the defining of good and bad<br/>
is NOT the point. In Christianity the point is peace with God through faith<br/>
in Christ. In Buddhism the point is the cessation of individual existence in<br/>
an illusory world, to exist only in Nirvana. Christians want to propogate<br/>
their religion because they believe people will be judged by God when they<br/>
die, and so they think people need forgiveness to enter heaven instead of<br/>
hell. Buddhists propogate their religion because they believe people are<br/>
blinded by the material world from their need to escape into a painless and<br/>
selfless existence in Nirvana. It IS the root principle that matters. The<br/>
moral system is a reflection of the root belief. That's why Buddhist morals<br/>
and Christian morals are so different. They DON"T teach the same thing. I'd<br/>
assume from your post that you're not a very religious guy. Talk to anybody<br/>
who takes their religion seriously and you'll find that the beliefs are most<br/>
important, not the least important.<br/>
<br/>
Which, that's why the Jesuit missionaries tried to clothe Christian truth in<br/>
the fashion of contemporary Japanese religion. Christian beliefs with<br/>
Japanese rituals or practice. It's the underlying  belief that is most<br/>
important. So, in theory, if you make it look a little more Japanese, it<br/>
becomes easier for the Japanese to understand, but the core beliefs remain<br/>
intact. This method of propogating Roman Catholic faith was used by their<br/>
missionaries a lot. It isn't looked at as deceitful, but simply as<br/>
communicating their beliefs in such a way as to be more easily understood,<br/>
and to some extent, in a manner more palatable to the mind of the one being<br/>
taught. Some of this has to do with Aristotelian distinctions between the<br/>
accident and occident of a thing... The "accident" is the appearance of a<br/>
thing. The "occident" is the core essence. The accident doesn't matter<br/>
nearly as much as the occident. So, as long as the same core belief is being<br/>
taught, then the Catholics didn't care what it looked like. (In actual<br/>
practice, though, the old Catholic method tends toward syncretism... mixing<br/>
of both belief and ritual... so nothing remains in its pure form).</div>
