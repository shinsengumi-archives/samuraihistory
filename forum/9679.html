Sorry  about the previous questions, they weren't very well thought<br/>
through.  Anyways the reason why I'm asking these new questions is<br/>
because, I need a  primary source for my essay.<br/>
<br/>
1. If a samurai was to lose a battle, and  return alive, would he<br/>
commit suicide?<br/>
Not necessarily. It would depend on several circumstances.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
2.  Were there any female samurai? <br/>
Yes, though usually they were referred to as Onna Musha. Most women of the  <br/>
samurai class stayed on the homefront and used their naginata to defend the  <br/>
home. There were a few who went on the battlefield. You can do some work on  <br/>
Google to find out more details.<br/>
<br/>
3.  What would happen if a samurai's katana was stolen?<br/>
Well, he'd either find another katana or use his wakizashi.<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
4. If  a samurai used seppuku to regain his honor, what would happen to<br/>
his  family?<br/>
That depends upon the situation. <br/>
 <br/>
I think that you need to visit some sites dedicated to Japanese history to  <br/>
answer your questions. Try Samurai Archives Wiki. Also check out "Ten  <br/>
Misconceptions About Samurai" (search on Google to find the exact site).<br/>
 <br/>
Hope this helps. Nina aka "Wave Tossed"<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-783481983">1. If a samurai was to lose a battle, and return alive, would he commit <br/>
suicide?<br/>
Why should he? That only happens in movies.<br/>
<br/>
2. Were there any female samurai?<br/>
Yeah and they were really hot looking but they usually had a bad case of <br/>
PMS. They had names like Hot Susuki or Kamon Iwannalaya<br/>
<br/>
3. What would happen if a samurai's katana was stolen?<br/>
He would head over to the nearest pawnshop to pick up a replacement or just <br/>
go ahead and carve a big wooden club and add some nails to it. Otherwise, he <br/>
would just use his bare hands. Come on, you've never seen a Japanese martial <br/>
arts film?<br/>
<br/>
4. If a samurai used seppuku to regain his honor, what would happen to his <br/>
family?<br/>
Seppuku was just a way to escape facing failure like the grade you're going <br/>
to get because you can't do your own research.</div>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>If you need a primary source, then this definitely isn't the place to<br/>
look for one. Answers from people on this board, or from samurai<br/>
websites or what have you, would be what's called a "secondary source".<br/>
That is, people who didn't live during the time you're researching. A<br/>
"primary source" is something written during the actual time period.<br/>
It's the difference between reading The Book of Five Rings and reading a<br/>
book about The Book of Five Rings.</div>
