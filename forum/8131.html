<div id="ygrps-yiv-1354610443">Greetings,<br/>
  I have a good friend who is a member of the main branch of the <br/>
Suenaga Clan (Suenaga Shamay)for who I as an ameture historian am <br/>
doing some research.<br/>
   I am seeking information on Castles held by the Suenaga Clan <br/>
ideally including plans and photos. I especially would by interested <br/>
in finding a reconstruction of NODA Castle in Osaka which was held by <br/>
the Suenaga faily during the first half of the 16th century.<br/>
     I also am seeking information on the Color and Design of the <br/>
Suenaga Mon to paint as a gift for her.<br/>
     Additionally I would like to find a complete clan history in <br/>
english. I am especially interested in the 10th through 17th centuries.<br/>
<br/>
Thank You</div>
