<br/>
7th Annual Samurai Archives Samurai Fiction Contest - 2011 <br/>
<br/>
Seventh Annual Samurai Fiction Contest, 2011<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
The parameters for the Seventh annual Samurai Fiction contest are covered on this page. This year we're going back to basics. The story is to be historical fiction, but the genre is WIDE OPEN. Be it Horror, Sci-fi, Suspense, it's all up to you how you want to handle it. <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Requirements: <br/>
<br/>
This is to be a piece of fiction writing taking place within an unspecified period in Japanese history. As mentioned above, the genre is wide open <br/>
<br/>
Parameters: <br/>
<br/>
The story is required to be more than 1,000 words, with a 5,000 word targeted limit - overages are acceptable if necessary, but please don't overdo it. It can be done in the first person, or the third person, and must be a complete short story, not an excerpt from a larger story. Please list your chosen genre on your entry. Although the particular genre will not affect judging, all entrants will be judged on how well they utilize thier chosen genre.<br/>
<br/>
Disqualifications: Stories with numerous blatant misspellings or poor grammar may be immediately disqualified at the judges discretion. Please spellcheck and proofread your stories. You have until December 2011, plenty of time to correct spelling mistakes and grammar issues.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
There is no fee to enter the samurai fiction contest. The contest is completely free and open to all. The entries will be published on Samurai Archives.com, with the winner featured. Writers will retain all rights to their stories. A maximum of two stories per entrant are allowed. <br/>
<br/>
Please note that any stories that are disqualified for bad grammar or spelling will not be published on the website. <br/>
<br/>
Submission Information: <br/>
<br/>
Submissions are to be sent via email to webmaster |at| samurai-archives.com in a WORD .Doc format, .TXT file OR HTML. At the top of the first page, please include your full name, your Yahoo ID, and Samurai Archives Citadel ID (or whichever is applicable) your email address, as well as the genre the story falls under, and the title of your story. You will receive a confirmation email that your submission has been received. A maximum of two stories per author are acceptable. <br/>
<br/>
Judging and Winning the contest: <br/>
<br/>
Submissions will be judged by a panel of Yahoo Group and/or Samurai Citadel community members who are not submitting stories. The judges will not be told who the authors of each respective submision are until after the judging has closed, to avoid any swaying of the judges. The recipient of the submissions (The Samurai Archives webmaster) will not be a judge, and will only moderate the proceedings, to keep entries anonymous. The winning story will be featured on the Samurai Archives site as the winner of the 2011 Samurai Fiction contest. All stories will be placed in the 'Fan Fiction' section of the Samurai Archives as well. The winner will be announced at the Yahoo Group and the Samurai Archives Citadel at the end of judging in December. <br/>
