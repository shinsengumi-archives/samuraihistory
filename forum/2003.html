<h3>Re: [samuraihistory] latch?</h3>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-2091251095">I noted that too. A latch very much like that on Gunto was <br/>
occasionally seen on tanto especially ones with metal saya. Satsuma <br/>
dandies liked to flaunt their "manly hot-headedness" by sporting <br/>
cords that tied the tsuka to the saya. These prevented the sword from <br/>
being drawn except with the most deliberate effort. Suggesting to <br/>
some that you better not get the man angry...<br/>
	The koiguchi or opening on a proper saya should be airtight, <br/>
to prevent moisture getting in the scabbard and keep ones sword from <br/>
falling out. In the movies there is often an audible "Click" when <br/>
this seal is broken. I imagined this is what the writer meant and it <br/>
helped keep my mental images "honest."<br/>
	I believe the writer went to great pains to make his book <br/>
ENGLISH. Thus he used English terms whereever possible, even in cases <br/>
where the Japanese term is widely used. While I applaud his efforts, <br/>
I found this one of the most annoying aspects of his style and it <br/>
detracted greatly from the book for me.<br/>
