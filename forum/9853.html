<div id="ygrps-yiv-1902179559">I would say both, but it really depended on the army.  There was often a thin line between high ranking ashigaru and very low ranking samurai, so either would suffice.  Usually, it would be a high ranking ashigaru (the equivalent of a sergeant or a lieutennant in the U.S. Army), who would then be under the command of either a kumigashira or a monogashira (division commander, one way or another).<br/>
