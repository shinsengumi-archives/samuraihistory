 </span></blockquote>I'd say that there are probably unrecorded assassinations and secret<br/>
betrayals that were never recorded.  A lot of people died suddenly, or<br/>
thier deaths came at a perfect time for thier enemies.  So I've always<br/>
figured there were probably behind the scenes work that we'll never<br/>
know about that might change the entire view of Japanese history. I<br/>
would think that if a battle was enough to change history, than it<br/>
would have made the history books, unless the impact wasn't apparent.<br/>
I did read a few years ago that decendants of various Samurai families<br/>
still have 400 year old correspondences, but refuse to let scholars<br/>
look at them because they are "family matters". Aargh!</div>

do you believe that there are untold truths in the samurai history, <br/>
such as unrecorded battles that may have changed history?<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-270227533">In my humble opinion:<br/>
Every singular event in universe is affecting history of course. As the usual reference says, the movement of the wings of a  butterfly in the brazilian rainforest can start a typhoon in Hong Kong.<br/>
So, should be an infinite number of single situations, not only every single decision of every samurai, but every single breath of every farmer, that indeed could have affected the samurai history. How many single unrecorded events were neccesary to produce the final output in Okehazama battle, as an example?<br/>
Scale of the event even is not a worthy reference. An individual action could be so decisive like the performance of an entire army. <br/>
In that point of view, of course, should be lots of unrecorded critical situations that may have changed history. As impressive events like a battle?<br/>
At one point the event is so impressive that is recorded independently of their influence in history. So probably, as has been said before, main battles probably not. Small skirmishes, almost for sure.<br/>
Of course, probably all this is obvious, but I think that is neccesay to establish my arguments in order to say that, yes, to the the question.<br/>
