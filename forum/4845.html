<br/>
	A couple of notes on this dialogue - first (to be fair), the original TMNT<br/>
was a loving one-shot satire of Frank Miller's Daredevil comic, heavily<br/>
influenced in turn by Kozure Okami (Lone Wolf and Cub).  What grew out of<br/>
that single-issue in-joke can be seen as a kind of huge marketing joke in<br/>
and of itself, but as a satire of American youth and media fads (i.e. the<br/>
martial arts film craze, teen teams in comics, funny animal comics, anime<br/>
and manga influence, etc.), the original was pretty amusing.  Not great<br/>
literature; certainly not on a par with Kozure Okami, as far as graphic<br/>
storytelling goes; but amusing all the same.<br/>
That aside, this comment sounds like something I'd say.  That's some quality<br/>
ranting there.  (And I do mean that as a compliment.)<br/>
On a more serious note:<br/>

Subject: Re: Weapons of Ninjas<br/>
<br/>
(snip)  ... they are not Ninja weapons, in actual fact they were<br/>
originally farming implements that was used to plant seeds. Now I<br/>
don't know when but they got extended for battle and instead of<br/>
carrying two they actually carried THREE one in each hand and one<br/>
tucked into their belt. When entering battle they would run towards<br/>
there enemies throwing one of the sai's  at the enemy then drew the<br/>
third one ready for combat. (snip)<br/>
	This comment about the agricultural derivation of the sai is one I've heard<br/>
before.  And back in the '70s, I remember my teacher telling me about the<br/>
practise of carrying a third sai for throwing (Draeger & Smith's<br/>
_Comprehensive Asian Fighting Arts_ also corroborates this.).  But I have<br/>
also heard (and this seems more credible to me) that the sai were originally<br/>
Okinawan hay-hooks, that the worker would stick one sai into each end of a<br/>
(small) bale and walk away with these as handles.  In terms of design, they<br/>
seem better suited to this than to planting, as the side tines would serve<br/>
to stabilise the bale, while I can't think what use they are in planting.<br/>
Anyone have any sources to cite on this question?  Oral tradition on this<br/>
continent is something I have learned to regard with great suspicion, as<br/>
I've found plenty of bad information being passed along in good faith by<br/>
folks who honestly believed what they were saying.  So Zev, please don't<br/>
take this as a challenge of your integrity, as that's not my intention at<br/>
all.  But I would like to nail down the facts if I can.<br/>
	Apparently (according to Draeger & Smith again) a weapon of this design has<br/>
been in use under various names for over 1500 years, everywhere from India<br/>
to Okinawa, and observes, "Evidence exists which favours Indonesia as the<br/>
place of origin.  ...Ancient Indonesian civilizations on Sumatra and Java,<br/>
which had contact with Okinawa, used the weapon in their combat systems."<br/>
If this is so (and Draeger tends to be reliable), then it may never have had<br/>
an agricultural application at all:  any stories of that sort could<br/>
conceivably have been 'cover stories' devised during such times as the<br/>
carrying of weapons was illegal.  ("This, officer?  Nah, this ain't a<br/>
weapon.  This is a, uh, hay hook.  Yeah, a hay hook.  Got a couple of 'em.<br/>
And, um a spare.  In case one gets, y'know, broken.  Or something.")  This<br/>
is pure speculation on my part, so I'd be very interested in more solid<br/>
information.<br/>
	Draeger & Smith also note that the weapon "never became popular in Japan<br/>
and is almost completely divorced from Japanese combat systems; it is only<br/>
seen in those karate systems that have an Okinawan tradition."  So as far as<br/>
the ninja and sai go, I guess we do have to blame those pesky adolescent<br/>
terrapins.  And that, in turn, goes back to Frank Miller putting sai in the<br/>
hands of Daredevil's girlfriend Elektra... although her fingers were always<br/>
positioned wrong... which may take us back to that 'badly researched<br/>
American excuse' business again.  Come to think of it, he could never draw<br/>
the tip of a katana right either.<br/>
	Admittedly, kobujutsu is a bit of a digression from samurai history.  But<br/>
as far as that goes, does anyone have any information on whether individual<br/>
samurai are likely to have trained in any of the kobu weapons?<br/>
