<h3>Last Samurai Desktop Backgrounds</h3>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1185557648">I've uploaded 3 large Last Samurai screenshots that are actually <br/>
made for desktop backgrounds.  I thought it might interest people <br/>
interested in the armor worn in the movie, as there are some closeup <br/>
shots:<br/>

another story you might check out is the suikoden.<br/>
from what i remember suikoden is the original chinese title.  japan <br/>
has its own, slightly personalized, version.  suikoden roughly <br/>
translates into "water margin"<br/>
pearl buck did the only translation into english that im aware of.  <br/>
its title is "all men are brothers".<br/>
its hard to find and harder to read.  very dry.<br/>
anyway, the heros of the suikoden are a very popular subject for iri <br/>
zumi.<br/>
(i once came across a book of prints.  very big, very beutifull and <br/>
very exensive.  i kick myself now for not dropping the 80$ because i <br/>
havnt seen it since.)<br/>
check into suikoden and you might find some interesting characters <br/>
and prints.</div>

 </span></blockquote>i kind of thought that might be the case.<br/>
the eight dog samurai threw me, though.  suikoden has over a hundred <br/>
heros.<br/>
is it actually about 8 samurai or does the number have some other <br/>
significance?<br/>
<br/>
on the side, theres a sonny chiba film about 8(?) samurai.  wonder if <br/>
its based on hakkenden.  would be kind of disapointing to know how <br/>
badly they slaughtered a story of such significance.  was happy <br/>
believing it was just some good, if cheesy, chop-sockey.</div>

 </span></blockquote>No, Takizawa Bakin brought the number down to eight to make it easier... and <br/>
then spent 26 years writing Japan's mega novel. In paperback, it's ten volumes. <br/>
I'm a great fan of the Hakkenden, so you might not want to get me started. <G><br/>

<br/>
It's actually based on a tarted up fantasy two-part novel called "Shin Satomi <br/>
Hakkenden" which was written in, IIRC, the '70s.<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>It's never been translated into English. (Like I said, it's ten volumes of very <br/>
small type in Japanese.) That's still pretty much the only commonly available <br/>
edition of it, although there are a few abridgements and "children's book" <br/>
versions of the tale. All are Japanese.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
There was a popular(ish) anime series a few years back loosely based (very!) on <br/>
the book.<br/>
<br/>
If you want to find info about it, a search of the whole title will be more <br/>
productive: "Nanso Satomi Hakkenden."</div>
