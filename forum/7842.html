<div id="ygrps-yiv-997909385">Uhhhh!!!  Heh, heh, heh!!! Hard questions...<br/>
<br/>
Have you seen the film SEPPUKU? If you haven't, do so at your earliest<br/>
opportunity. There is a new Criterion edition out with subtitles in English.<br/>
Is English your native language, or is it Spanish? Don't know if a Spanish<br/>
sub-titled edtion is out. <br/>
<br/>
At any rate, in this film, an impoverished ronin is torn between the choice<br/>
of selling his sword blades to raise money to feed his wife and child. If he<br/>
did not do this, then his family would get sick and starve. So he sells the<br/>
sword blades. And ends up being brutally punished for this "sin" by some<br/>
clan samurai who see him as being utterly dishonored. I personally see the<br/>
man who sold his swords to try and keep his family from starving as having<br/>
far more honor than the judgmental people who heaped blame upon him. As the<br/>
man's father-in-law states later on in the film, "even a samurai cannot live<br/>
on air." <br/>
<br/>
I'm in the middle of writing a piece of fiction that deals with somewhat<br/>
similar themes. I try and ask,"what is a sword and what is the soul? Is a<br/>
sword simply a metal object or is it a part of your being?." There is an old<br/>
Zen saying, I do not know who wrote it, "I have no sword; I make my mind my<br/>
sword." <br/>
<br/>
I studied kendo for ten years and I know personally about how a sword or a<br/>
bamboo shinai can become an actual extension of your body. I own a single<br/>
Nihonto, a 400 year old wakizashi without signature on the tang (it used to<br/>
be a katana but was cut down) and when I handle this sword, I know that it<br/>
is more than merely metal. So also, I know that when a samurai was forced to<br/>
give up or sell his sword to feed his family, it probably was agony for him.<br/>
But he might have had to do it and this was tragic.  <br/>
<br/>
I don't know if I made much sense here.<br/>
<br/>
Cheers, Nina<br/>

Good afternoon.<br/>
Nina why do you always brings this hard to answer questions ??? jajajaja !!!<br/>
Ok, I think that it was something philosophical and spiritual.  <br/>
Some one once told me that there is two senses in life that you can not<br/>
ingnore : first one is when your death time is getting close and second one<br/>
is when you are hungry !!! Then I understand why he brought out<br/>
his blades.   Katana was considered the soul of the<br/>
samurai since it was considered what ebodied bushido. <br/>
 This is interesting, a samurai think that his sword is an extention of his<br/>
body.  So he consider his sword<br/>
a part of it.   Besides, it was his primary weapon,<br/>
his life depends on it ( think about this carefully ).<br/>
  The katana is that, a weapon !!!   And the samurai<br/>
more than any one else new that.   <br/>
Something funny about this is that there is anything on the Bushido code<br/>
that have to do with weapons !!!<br/>
It is a moral and correct conduct code.    Then I<br/>
think that all this is a romantic tale out of some<br/>
Noh.   <br/>
Now, if you tell me that a samurai fells something special and spiritual for<br/>
his sword, I will be with<br/>
you in a 100%.   <br/>
<br/>
Best regards.    <br/>

<h3>RE: Sword Is The Soul Of The Samurai? (was RE: [samuraihistory] R	e: h itokiri kawakami gensai?)</h3>

<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1205795009">Back to film discussion, as I don't have access to actual records of real<br/>
people. There is an intersesting set of situations in the film TASOGARE<br/>
SEIBEI aka TWILIGHT SAMURAI, an excellent film which I believe is based on a<br/>
novel. It takes place in the late Edo/early Bakumatsu period. Here we have<br/>
as the main character, Seibei, a clan samurai who is very low-paid and he<br/>
struggles to survive and support his family. He is widowed and must support<br/>
several children plus his mother who has become senile. The film portrays<br/>
him as being up to his ears in debt, which actually was the fate of many<br/>
samurai and even daimyo during the Edo period. As a samurai, he serves his<br/>
lord in an accounting office every day. But at night, he must supplement his<br/>
meager income (50 koku of rice per year, which was about as low as a<br/>
samurai's stipend could get); he has to take in craft piecework to make and<br/>
sell to a wholesaler -- which was a common way for samurai or ronin to make<br/>
money, though the income was usually paltry. Seibei makes insect cages,<br/>
which are very intricate and he uses quite a lot of skill to piece these<br/>
together. But he only gets paid by the piece, and in a scene with the<br/>
wholesaler, the wholesaler explains that the market for insect cages just<br/>
isn't all that great these days, so he will continue to receive only a<br/>
pittance for his cages.<br/>
<br/>
****SPOILER ALERT*** Don't read this paragraph if you haven't seen the film<br/>
and don't wish to know what happens at the end.   <br/>
<br/>
It turns out that Seibei is quite skilled as a swordfighter. He is<br/>
challenged to a "live" duel by another in his clan. He shows up at the<br/>
agreed site with a bokken (wooden practice sword), stating that he'll use<br/>
this against his opponent's live katana. He defeats the opponent. Because of<br/>
his skill, Seibei's lord orders him to kill a renegade former clansman who<br/>
has run off to join one of the factions in the civil uprisings that occurred<br/>
during this period. He ends up facing the man inside a deserted house, where<br/>
the two have a discussion. Seibei explains that his expertise is with the<br/>
wakizashi. But also explains that he sold his katana some time earlier to<br/>
pay for his wife's funeral, and thus wears a bamboo katana -- which is why<br/>
he had used a bokken for the earlier duel; he had no katana. The duel takes<br/>
place, with Seibei using his wakizashi, and he kills his opponent and<br/>
returns home to live out his days serving his clan until he loses his life<br/>
(still serving his lord) in one of the bakumatsu uprisings.<br/>
<br/>
****END SPOILER ALERT***<br/>
<br/>
This is a very good film on many layers. Among other things, it explores the<br/>
martial ethic of a late Edo period low-ranked, impoverished samurai.<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
Ha Ha u struck again Ms Boal thats an awesome question and depends on how u<br/>
look at it. If we treat martial arts or life in general as living to make<br/>
the lives of others better than how is there a lose in honor for n e thing<br/>
of a sort of selling to help provide for ones family. However, if u wanna<br/>
tie Pride and Honor together then thats totally something else.</div>
