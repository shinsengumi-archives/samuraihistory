<h3>Re: [samuraihistory] Yagyu Jubei</h3>

<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-670131824">I don't know about how biographical it is, but where I started getting info <br/>
on him was through the Capcom PlayStation 2 game Oni-Musha 2: Samurai's <br/>
Destiny (which, admittedly, takes A LOT of liberties with life dates, as the <br/>
game was set in 1570 or 1573, and Jubei wasn't born until the 1600's).  From <br/>
what little I've read on the actual man, he was born in 1606 to a sword <br/>
instructor in the Tokugawa government, and himself grew to be a great <br/>
swordsman.  From that same source (an on-line edition of a Japanese magazine, <br/>
which one I am not sure), he died in 1650, possibly in either a battle or a <br/>
duel.<br/>
  By the way, I've got a question of my own: Does anyone know where I can <br/>
find out more about Saiga (or Saigo) Magoichi?<br/>

 </span></blockquote>In order to unsubscribe from the Yahoo samuraihistory group, you must <br/>
first ask your Internet Provider to mail you an Unsubscribing Kit. <br/>
Then follow the directions.<br/>
<br/>
The kit will most likely be the standard no-fault type. Depending on <br/>
requirements, System A and/or System B can be used. When operating <br/>
System A, depress lever and a plastic dalkron unsubscriber will be <br/>
dispensed through the slot immediately underneath. When you have <br/>
fastened the adhesive lip, attach connection marked by the large 'X' <br/>
outlet hose. Twist the silver-colored ring one inch below the <br/>
connection point until you feel it lock.<br/>
<br/>
The kit is now ready for use.<br/>
<br/>
The Cin-Eliminator is activated by the small switch on the lip. When <br/>
securing, twist the ring back to its initial condition, so that the <br/>
two orange lines meet. Disconnect. Place the dalkron unsubscriber in <br/>
the vacuum receptacle to the rear. Activate by pressing the blue <br/>
button. The controls for System B are located on the opposite side. <br/>
The red release switch places the Cin-Eliminator into position; it <br/>
can be adjusted manually up or down by pressing the blue manual <br/>
release button. The opening is self-adjusting. To secure after use, <br/>
press the green button, which simultaneously activates the evaporator <br/>
and returns the Cin-Eliminator to its storage position.<br/>
<br/>
You may log off if the green exit light is on over the evaporator. If <br/>
the red light is illuminated, one of the Cin-Eliminator requirements <br/>
has not been properly implemented. Press the "List Guy" call button <br/>
on the right of the evaporator . He will secure all facilities from <br/>
his control panel.<br/>
<br/>
To use the Auto-Unsub, first undress and place all your clothes in <br/>
the clothes rack. Put on the velcro slippers located in the cabinet <br/>
immediately below. Enter the shower, taking the entire kit with you. <br/>
On the control panel to your upper right upon entering you will see <br/>
a "Shower seal" button. Press to activate. A green light will then be <br/>
illuminated immediately below. On the intensity knob, select the <br/>
desired setting. Now depress the Auto-Unsub activation lever. Bathe <br/>
normally. The Auto-Unsub will automatically go off after three <br/>
minutes unless you activate the "Manual off" override switch by <br/>
flipping it up. When you are ready to leave, press the blue "Shower <br/>
seal" release button. The door will open and you may leave. Please <br/>
remove the velcro slippers and place them in their container.<br/>
<br/>
If you prefer the ultrasonic log-off mode, press the indicated blue <br/>
button. When the twin panels open, pull forward by rings A & B. The <br/>
knob to the left, just below the blue light, has three settings, low, <br/>
medium or high. For normal use, the medium setting is suggested. <br/>
After these settings have been made, you can activate the device by <br/>
switching to the "ON" position the clearly marked red switch. If <br/>
during the unsubscribing operation, you wish to change the settings, <br/>
place the "manual off" override switch in the "OFF" position. You may <br/>
now make the change and repeat the cycle. When the green exit light <br/>
goes on, you may log off and have lunch. You will then be <br/>
unsubscribed from Yahoo samuraihistory.<br/>
<br/>
The second option is to follow the directions included at the bottom <br/>
of every email message from this group:<br/>

<h3>Saiga Magoichi</h3>
by <i>jeromelarre</i>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1834628191">Hello,<br/>
<br/>
Through various sources but that I can't consider are the most <br/>
serious ones,<br/>
I met several times the name of Saiga Magoichi. I think he's somehow <br/>
related<br/>
to the saiga musketeers in sengoku period but I am not sure about <br/>
this.<br/>
<br/>
Does anybody has any clue if it is a hisorical or fictionnal <br/>
character and<br/>
what he did or supposely did to be famous?<br/>
<br/>
Thank you<br/>
<br/>
Jérôme.</div>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-442995679">Hey,<br/>
       Saiga, or Saigo, Magoichi was a real person from the Sengoku era.  If <br/>
memory serves me correctly, and I do not remember where I read it although it <br/>
was online, he was a captain, or leader in some way, of a gun squadron in the <br/>
Kii area, and may have been somehow associated with a group of monks there.  <br/>
Additionally, although it doesn't really matter or apply: He made an appearance <br/>
in Capcom's best game ever, Onimusha 2: Samurai's Destiny in a supporting <br/>
role, where he is referred to as "captain of the Kiishi Saiga Gun Team".  Hope <br/>
this helps a little.  :-)  Take care.  :-)<br/>
