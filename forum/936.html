<div id="ygrps-yiv-520498532">Hello,<br/>
How are you? I had stumbled upon your page as I was looking about <br/>
some pages. So I joined. I really enjoy the history of The Samurai. <br/>
I have many books on the subject. I have a few contacts who are <br/>
authors. I am also involved in a historiacl re-enactment group. A <br/>
small group of us potray's a Japanese Shiro. We have great fun with <br/>
it. Again I just wanted to say hello and I llok forward to talking <br/>
to you all more!<br/>
