<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-2047911784">i came across questions concerning l.h.samurai. my opinion:<br/>
my personal training encompassed equal facility with either side of <br/>
the body as there is no "dominant" side. this training progressed to <br/>
blade & weapons,& firearms. left & right-equal. ten years ago i lost <br/>
my right arm.(complete amputation- i do not use prosthesis. except <br/>
for fishing.) i believe my training gave me a great advantage as i am <br/>
able to do about ANYTHING i could before- from tying my boots to <br/>
riding a motorcycle. ok-i had to give up guitar and a couple of other <br/>
things- but ON THE WHOLE i am at no real disadvantage in most <br/>
situations including close quarters combat. i see no reason why the <br/>
Samurai would not train thier bodies to function in the same manner.i <br/>
would really like to hear from anyone with 'missing parts' in similar <br/>
situations.</div>

 </span></blockquote>Well, I suppose my situation counts as similar, I'm registered as blind,<br/>
and I've been teaching my own combat sport for over twenty years now, so<br/>
I agree that disability is no handicap as long as you don't listen to<br/>
those who tell you that it should be. I teach the competitive  use of<br/>
historical reproduction arms and armour, I've done archery and used to<br/>
shoot full bore pistol when it was legal over here in the UK. And now<br/>
just for fun I run a tiny group of historical re-enactors recreating<br/>
momoyama Japan, as well as running an airsoft campaign from an ex-<br/>
government nuclear bunker (now a museum), and my good lady is a science<br/>
fiction author. Life can take you down truely unexpected and strange<br/>
paths when it wants to, would you not agree?:-)<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1951535681">Greetings,<br/>
<br/>
  From what I have gathered from various readings and the teachings of my <br/>
sensei the concept of a left-handed kenshi is against the mentality of the <br/>
Japanese during the pre-Meiji periods.<br/>
  Nearly everything in Japanese life was uniform, including the manner in <br/>
which people wore their kimono and walked down the street.  People always <br/>
walked to the left, much in the manner that European people drive.  If there <br/>
was a left-handed kenshi, his saya would be hitting everyone that he walked <br/>
by which would, in essence, be insulting and challenging to any other kenshi <br/>
he happened to meet.<br/>
  Now I am not saying that there were no kenshi that were left hand <br/>
dominant, but they were trained to use the daito as if they were <br/>
right-handed.  Left hand dominant kenshi would have an advantage in the use <br/>
of the wakizashi as a secondary weapon, since it could be drawn left-handed <br/>
if the right hand was occupied.<br/>
  I hope that this has helped in some way.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Peace,<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1432307488">I understand the idea of rigid uniformity regarding r .handedness, but I would still bet that your average Joe Samurai was just as facile with either hand UNLESS- as in some Arabic or Islamic beliefs- there was some prohibition or religious rule against left-handedness- the left being the "dirty" or "evil" hand- forbidden to eat with- ect<br/>
 I have trouble seeing any fighter just rolling over & showing his throat if his right hand/arm was incapacitated.    <br/>
