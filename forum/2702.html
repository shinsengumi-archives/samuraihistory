presence. Sigh.<br/>
<br/>
It is complete unmitigated fiction. And no, there are no more samurai; they <br/>
ceased to exist with the stroke of a legislative pen (okay, a brush) in the 1870s.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Tony, I don't think the problem is with the movie, which is actually <br/>
quite good (as a movie - NOT documentary).<br/>
<br/>
The problem is with the fact that far too many kids are ignorant in <br/>
history (which they "learn" only from movies and videogames), while a <br/>
few other people have a problem in telling facts from fiction.<br/>
<br/>
I think the role of this mailing list should be to beef them up with a <br/>
good dose of reliable information,  and in a way "The Last Samurai" <br/>
offers the chance to many people to begin to learn something for real. <br/>
And for us who know a bit about the samurai, is a great chance to share <br/>
our knowledge with others.<br/>
<br/>
Let's keep a positive, open-minded spirit.<br/>
<br/>
Gaman, gaman!!! ;o)<br/>

classical US Army Field manuals. That was not how<br/>
Romans really fought....<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1349301368">I suppose because it's late that my twisted lawyer's mind is looking at this <br/>
question sideways (are there still samurai?), but I suppose it's analogous to <br/>
the question of whether or  not there is still French, German, or Russian <br/>
royalty.<br/>
<br/>
There are certainly claimants to these thrones, even though the thrones were <br/>
abolished with the stroke of a pen (ok, sometimes the stroke was accompanied <br/>
by a revolution, but you get my drift).  Still, the legislation abolishing the <br/>
existence of the monarchy doesn't stop people from claiming to be royal.<br/>
<br/>
In the same way, I suppose that someone with the proper ancestry could still <br/>
claim to be samurai, even if the law does not recognize his or her claim.<br/>

was their family doing in the Tokugawa period, and only TWO could <br/>
answer. One is the descendent from a Gono (a rich farmer) and he is <br/>
still the son of the head of a village in Ise; the other knows his <br/>
family was in business in Sakai. My wife comes from a noble family of <br/>
scholars from Kyoto, but she did not know!! I had to do the research <br/>
for her!!!! Phew.<br/>

<h3>Dead Subjects-II</h3>
by <i>Lee Changsub</i>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1542663633">Dear Cesare:<br/>
I do appreciate for your extensive study and stay in<br/>
Japan and bondage through your marriage. But, let me<br/>
tell you one story...<br/>
<br/>
One of American professors I used to know personally<br/>
stayed for only a few days in Japan when he was in his<br/>
early thirties. Yet, he met the Japanese prime<br/>
minister for a talk.<br/>
Staying 5 years in Japan and interrogating 'a<br/>
gazillion of' young Japanese friends sounds indeed<br/>
scholastic.<br/>
But I wonder if it would be the same experience for<br/>
you if you also could visit Japan 5 days and meet a<br/>
Japanese prime minister and other noble families.<br/>
<br/>
Maybe, you have to expand your Japanese network with<br/>
more emphasis on quality instead on quantity.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
                            Sincerely,<br/>
<br/>
<br/>

entertaining autobiography of Fukuzawa Yukichi, when he fist visits the <br/>
US he is really puzzled at finding out how Americans do knowvery little <br/>
about their ancestors. Japan is becoming a bit like that, with people <br/>
having no idea of what their families were doing only a bit more than <br/>
100 years ago. That's all!<br/>

 </span></blockquote>I would push it even a bit further. I do not believe they are <br/>
"inaccurate." Inaccurate would be something that wants to be <br/>
historically accurate but it's not. Here we talk about plain historical <br/>
FICTION. The two main characters of "The Last Samurai" are NOT <br/>
historical characters, so, to expect accuracy is a paradox. This is a <br/>
major Hollywood production that entertains for a couple of hours, and <br/>
that's it. It has been done to make $$$, and features one of the most <br/>
popular actors in the world. It's not a cult-movie for a bunch of <br/>
scholars of the samurai. So, take it or leave it, but if we criticize <br/>
the movie, we should do so thinking of what the movie IS, not what we <br/>
would like the movie TO BE.<br/>

<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-194875166">Nobody's expecting it to be accurate HISTORY--then it<br/>
becomes a documentary. Simply by being fiction, it's<br/>
not history. What bothers myself, and Tony, and<br/>
others, is when things that are simply WRONG are<br/>
perpetuated. For example, the samurai in the Satsuma<br/>
Rebellion did NOT fight with bows against a modern<br/>
army with firearms--as has been stated, the Japanese<br/>
had been using firearms for several centuries, and the<br/>
Satsuma army had firearms, wore "uniforms", and wasn't<br/>
this Sengoku style army. Though that makes for better<br/>
cinematography and wins you Oscars for costume design,<br/>
so accuracy loses to spectacle. <br/>
<br/>
The problem isn't with the STORY--heck, if we can<br/>
accept Shogun, we can accept anything. It's the<br/>
details that are flat WRONG, and perpetuate the myths.<br/>
That's what is so frustrating. I'll go see the movie,<br/>
and I might even enjoy it, but I will not understand<br/>
why you can't make a good movie that's not a bunch of<br/>
cliches and hogwash.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>I take a much harder view. "Dances With Wolves" is historical fiction, but it <br/>
doesn't pretend to present a "real" historical event. I have no problems with it <br/>
(although I can't stand it for other reasons).<br/>
<br/>
"Shakespeare in Love," likewise, as a comedy doesn't pretend to be history. I <br/>
have no problem with it. "Elizabeth," on the other hand, plays fast and loose <br/>
with history and historical characters and events and fails the test.<br/>
<br/>
No one thinks "Robin Hood" is history. No one thinks "Lion in Winter" is <br/>
history, but a fictive "slice of life" look at the family of Henry II.<br/>
<br/>
"Braveheart" masquerades as history, as does "Last Samurai."<br/>

they just swap entertainment for $$$.<br/>
Nevertheless, I really thought it was funny to see Tom Cruise and Ken <br/>
Watanabe fighting side-by-side against ninja. Last night I watched <br/>
again a couple of episodes of 'Toshiie to Matsue.' Well, the fighting <br/>
scenes were pathetic, anyway the whole show is all-over entertaining. <br/>
Why not accepting the distortion of modern production - especially when <br/>
we know that they are there for specific reasons?<br/>

The movie was a good movie, just like other people<br/>
have mentioned, Glory, Bravehart, Gladiator, hell, I<br/>
even like The Patriot.  If you didn't like the movie<br/>
cause you just didn't think it was good, then that's a<br/>
whole different thing, but don't down it cause it<br/>
wasn't accurate.  This movie is getting heat from the<br/>
general public, people who don't sympathize with a<br/>
foreign "epic" like this because they're not familiar<br/>
with the culture, and people like yourselves, who<br/>
conversly seem to know a little bit too much about the<br/>
culture to be able to enjoy the middle ground that the<br/>
film maker was probably trying to obtain for both<br/>
sides to be able to enjoy.<br/>
<br/>
I don't know about the rest of you, but I became<br/>
interested in romantic visions of honor back when I<br/>
was a child.  I think it's important to know the truth<br/>
about things, but not to let it destroy your sense of<br/>
romance.<br/>

TLS is, well... the Emperor. For the rest, it's all utter fiction, with <br/>
no real names, no real places and a Tom Cruise thrown into a small <br/>
Japanese village. I do not really see where TLS demands to be <br/>
accurately historical. I have never read on the website, or in any <br/>
interview to the movie crew they wanted to be historically fit. That <br/>
would have been impossible, as there are no records of Little Big Horn <br/>
veterans fighting with the samurai in the 1870's. I mean: what's the <br/>
problem in admitting it is simply entertaining historical fiction, and <br/>
amen?<br/>

more exciting, and more romantic than anything cooked up by the pool in <br/>
So.Cal. This begs the question; Why can't they get history right? Why <br/>
does there seem to be some aversion to an honest history? Is it that <br/>
history is too difficult to pin down? Is it too difficult for Hollywood <br/>
writers?(Afterall REAL writers don't go Hollywood) Are they really a <br/>
propaganda factory and they have to build in a message?<br/>
	How is it the BBC seems able to pull it off, and the NHK albeit <br/>
whitewashed (and they seem to be going the way of Hollywood...)<br/>
I seriously feel like I am missing something sometimes. Is ignorance <br/>
truly bliss?<br/>
