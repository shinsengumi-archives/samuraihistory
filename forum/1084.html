<h3>thanx and cdrom</h3>
by <i>llethal666</i>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1827570305">First of all, I'd like to say 'thank you' for all the support this list gave<br/>
me last year when I asked about references about samurai stuff...<br/>
And now I have the pleasure to show you the cdrom I told that I was<br/>
producing with some friends called 'Katana, a creation process'.<br/>
<br/>
This cdrom will be at the File Symposium (<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.file.org.br/)">http://www.file.org.br/)</a> (in the<br/>
Museun Pa√ßo das Artes) and if there is someone in Brazil, don't miss it :-)<br/>
<br/>
The cdrom language is portuguese, but if someone would like to see it<br/>
anyway, I could put it in a ftp address for download. Just let me know!<br/>
<br/>
btw, I have some screenshot here:<br/>

<br/>
Thanx, people!<br/>

Katana, a creation process<br/>
<br/>
The current study is directed in the exploration of the creative<br/>
differential in Japan. We'll study the influency of the japanese philosophy<br/>
at the artisan work and the swordsmiths at the moment of the sword<br/>
construction, looking for their own philosophical merits, the beauty and the<br/>
functionality. The sword wasn't just an object of cut for the Samurai but<br/>
something that had a philosophy, simbols, an interior essence or how it's<br/>
said, it has an soul. The peculiar and different way, that it was necessary<br/>
to get the ideal sword, made the artisan use cultural and religious aspects<br/>
in a symmetry with the Nature. The parallel universe of the oriental<br/>
creation is something mystic and philosophic, wich the objective is to<br/>
create<br/>
in a way to sensitize because of the beauty and the utility.</div>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1092692403">Hello gang!<br/>
Just wanted to let those of you in the Dallas/Ft. Worth area know there is a Japanese Armor Exhibit going on right now in Dallas.  I'm sorry for not putting this out their sooner but computer use is so limited right now.  Anyway, it's on Flora St. in Dallas, but I don't know EXACTLY where it is being held.  I am sorry for not being more precise with my information.  I didn't bring my paper with the address on it with me to my local Kinko's!  HA HA... As soon as I do I will write you all and let you know.  It is only going on until the 26th of August so get moving!  I just found out about it and nearly died because I didn't know it was here.!!!  Like I said, if I find the paper with the address on it I'll pass that along for you all. <br/>
 <br/>
Enjoy,<br/>
Christine<br/>
