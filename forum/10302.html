Our first podcast of our new series, The Battle of Nagashino and Its Context in the Military Revolution examines the battle of Nagashino, and how it fits in to the "Military Revolution" theory supported by historians such as Geoffrey Parker and Delmar Brown.  We examine the history of the battle, the biases of the sources, the "accepted" history of the battle of Nagashino, and where this all fits in the context of the Military Revolution theory.</div>
