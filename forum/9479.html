-Wow! What a show! Glad that WAM has started both it and SaiYuki <br/>
Reload over again (8Am/4PM/2AM ETs). How many animes have actual <br/>
historical figures in them? I can think of a few like Rurouni <br/>
Kenshin/Samurai X; Hellsing; SaiYuki/SYR; Read or Die and the new one <br/>
COD/Cutting Edge/AnimeNetwork/Le Chevalier D'Eon. The last one is set <br/>
at the time of the French revolts (1790s) and includes the title <br/>
character, the Royals, Duc d'Orleans (baddie) and a few others. Kyo <br/>
has lots like Nobunaga, Yukimura Sanada (what a family!) and Saito <br/>
Hajime (ancestor of his namesake who was Captain of the third squad <br/>
of the Shinsengumi featured in RK as well as Peacemaker). In <br/>
Peacemaker Saito is cast as a ghost seer who can see the dead souls <br/>
much like Ichigo in Bleach can. Well more soon. Have a cool day and <br/>
Kami bless you all. Toodles-K&K<br/>
