<h3>Samurai CDV photograph</h3>
by <i>dcress</i>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-123004746">Hello,<br/>
Can anyone help me identify the persons in the URL below. The photo <br/>
is a carte-de-visite taken in the late 1860's to mid 1870's. All the <br/>
adult males appear to be holding samurai swords. I can provide <br/>
closeups if anyone needs more details. Any help would be greatly <br/>
appreciated. Thanks for your time, David Cress<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1065758072">I believe you are looking at a group of farmers/townsmen (or perhaps a <br/>
troupe of entertainers) dressed up and posed for a photo by a European <br/>
photographer. None are wearing two swords, symbol of the Bushi class, <br/>
they are wearing brightly patterned expensive looking Hakama and <br/>
kimono, like a daimyo might wear, yet none of them seem to possess the <br/>
dignity one would expect of persons of that class. Men and women are <br/>
mixed together but without anything to indicate their status in the <br/>
group or with whom they might be associated (women were more like <br/>
possessions in those days so one would expect a female to stand <br/>
respectfully behind her father or husband while he was seated or in <br/>
some other way indicate her place in the group). A woman of good <br/>
breeding would never expose that much skin or any hint of her <br/>
underclothes in so public a display as a photograph.<br/>
	To me at least this is not a photograph of samurai but one of many <br/>
posed photos taken by photographers like Beato and others who were in <br/>
Japan just after the fall of the Shogun...<br/>
