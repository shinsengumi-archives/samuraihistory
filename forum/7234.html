Japan's Unresolved Questions of Historical Consciousness<br/>
by Herbert P. Bix  <br/>
June 14, 2005 <br/>
 <br/>
Japanese archaeologists and historians have long rejected the <br/>
government's claim that Japan has had 124 emperors from the mythical <br/>
Jimmu, descendant of the Sun Goddess, to the controversial Showa <br/>
Emperor Hirohito, whose pre-World War II reign brought havoc to <br/>
Asian and Japanese people. The scholars recognize that most sites of <br/>
ancient imperial tombs should be treated as objects of scientific <br/>
inquiry rather than as religious remnants of discredited State <br/>
Shinto. But bureaucrats of the Imperial Household Agency, claiming <br/>
to follow the Imperial Household Law, interpret the rules and <br/>
control the tombs. They will neither allow the tombs to be treated <br/>
as ordinary historical sites for investigation nor release copies of <br/>
documents pertaining to them or to more recent emperors. Professing <br/>
concern for the peace, calm, and privacy of emperors, but really <br/>
fearing public scrutiny of the imperial institution and <br/>
its "traditions," they continue to deny permission to excavate the <br/>
tombs. <br/>
<br/>
Recently, Toike Noboru, a professor of imperial history at Den-en <br/>
Chofu University in Tokyo, invoked Japan's freedom of information <br/>
law in his effort to make the numerous imperial tumuli that dot the <br/>
Japanese countryside accessible to historical knowledge.[1] At stake <br/>
is not only the possibility of writing a more lucid account of the <br/>
origins of the Japanese people but also a less idealized history of <br/>
the modern imperial house. Blood myths of an unbroken line of <br/>
imperial succession for ages eternal" (bansei ikkei) and Japan as <br/>
a "divine land" (shinkoku) could be better understood. Indeed, the <br/>
entire field of ancient Japanese history would benefit if the oldest <br/>
tombs were excavated, and the question of the imperial family's <br/>
descent from Korea could be resolved. We might also learn more about <br/>
why keepers of the imperial secrets go to such great lengths to <br/>
conceal this strong likelihood. Even Emperor Akihito has said that <br/>
the mother of the so-called "50th emperor," Kammu, had Korean blood <br/>
and "it made him feel a certain closeness to Korea."[2] <br/>
<br/>
But Akihito has never said anything that could offer support to <br/>
scholars who call for release of the historical papers of his <br/>
deceased father, Hirohito. Apparently the Japanese public lacks the <br/>
right to learn more about the activities of its most important 20th <br/>
century monarch. For how else to explain the failure to mount a <br/>
movement to revise laws and regulations of the Imperial Household <br/>
Agency, which were enacted by the Diet and are, presumably, laws <br/>
like any other.<br/>
<br/>
Today bold scholarly efforts to pry open the Imperial Household's <br/>
sanctuary -- its administration of graves, storehouses, archives, <br/>
and other related properties of hundreds of emperors, empresses, <br/>
dowager empresses, and imperial family members -- need to be <br/>
situated in a larger constitutional and historical context. Only <br/>
then can we see behind them the conflict between legacies of the old <br/>
and the new imperial order, and ultimately between the principles of <br/>
monarchy and democracy. Bring the virtually autonomous "symbol <br/>
monarchy" and its high-handed, secretive administrative practices <br/>
into the picture, and the tombs issue will also illuminate other <br/>
problems of historical consciousness that trouble Japan and disturb <br/>
its relations with Asian neighbors. <br/>
<br/>
*<br/>
<br/>
Tomb identification, restoration, and repair marked the first stage <br/>
in the construction of Japan's modern monarchy. The costly work was <br/>
begun in the early 1860s under Emperor Komei, father of the Meiji <br/>
emperor who served as the guiding light for Japan's modern <br/>
transformation. For decades the Tokugawa feudal regime had opposed <br/>
the identification of such burial sites. Only in its final crisis <br/>
years did it suddenly relent and cooperate in the project, which <br/>
continued until the Meiji Restoration. The grave of 14th century <br/>
Emperor Go-Daigo, one of the few monarchs who actually combined real <br/>
power and authority, was the first to be identified. Essentially, <br/>
the tombs and mausoleum denoted points of continuity with the <br/>
ancestors buried in them, purportedly stretching back in time to the <br/>
age of the gods. In that sense they signified exactly what Komei and <br/>
the "scholars of National Learning" most wanted to establish: <br/>
namely, the permanence of the imperial order, its connection with <br/>
the gods, and thus his own divinity.[3] <br/>
<br/>
Following the revolutionary changes that began in 1868, the <br/>
resurrection of emperorship continued. More burial mounds were <br/>
identified, and this activity became part of a major oligarchic <br/>
effort to foster belief in the myth of an unbroken line of imperial <br/>
succession. Numerous caretakers and performers of funeral rites <br/>
became involved in tomb maintenance, which developed into a major <br/>
function of the Imperial Household Ministry, predecessor to the <br/>
Agency. By the time of Meiji's death in 1912, the Japanese people <br/>
had been bound, in theory, to the emperor and his divine ancestors. <br/>
But Japan's bureaucratic elites still worried about the fragility of <br/>
their new monarchy, based on hereditary male succession. Their <br/>
worries increased during the reign of Meiji's son, the chronically <br/>
ill Taisho, of whom few expected anything. Already it had been made <br/>
a crime even to say that the emperor was not a living deity. In the <br/>
1920s lese majesty laws were tightened and teachings on the national <br/>
polity [kokutai], or the meaning of the throne in Japanese life, <br/>
further systematized. <br/>
<br/>
When Hirohito, the only emperor ever to be educated under the new <br/>
imperial system, ascended to the throne at the end of 1925, the <br/>
defining political principles, formalized in the Constitution <br/>
(1889), the Imperial Rescript on Education (1890), and kokutai <br/>
thought, began to be re-emphasized. But among ruling elites, fear <br/>
for the survival of the monarchy persisted. <br/>
<br/>
Meanwhile the number of graves identified as "imperial" kept on <br/>
increasing. When Japanese soldiers started dying in Manchuria during <br/>
the early 1930s, Yasukuni Shrine, charged with commemorating their <br/>
spirits and mobilizing the nation for war, took on new importance; <br/>
so too did the emperor's dispatch of emissaries to the grave sites <br/>
of his imperial ancestors, but especially to Ise Jingu, shrine for <br/>
the spirit of the Sun Goddess, and to Yasukuni. <br/>
<br/>
*<br/>
<br/>
After Japan's defeat in 1945, U.S. officials, with the active <br/>
cooperation of Japan's old guard "moderates," reformed and <br/>
constitutionally preserved the monarchy, for without constitutional <br/>
support it might not have lasted. Unwisely, they kept Hirohito on <br/>
the throne. They did, however, transform the emperor into a vague, <br/>
ill-defined "symbol" bereft of political power, but left undecided <br/>
the question of whether he is the head of state. They also abolished <br/>
State Shinto, formally disestablished but did not abolish Yasukuni <br/>
Shrine, and wrote a rigorous separation of politics and religion <br/>
into the Constitution. Because U.S. occupation officials treated <br/>
postwar Yasukuni the same way they treated Hirohito -- keeping him <br/>
on the throne and indulgently shielding him from the Tokyo War <br/>
Crimes Trial -- the shrine was eventually able to restore its <br/>
authority and resume its close connection with the monarchy. <br/>
Hirohito paid his first post-occupation visit to Yasukuni in 1952, <br/>
his last in 1975. Three years after that final visit, the name-list <br/>
of the newly enshrined martyrs arrived at the Imperial Household <br/>
Agency. Hirohito learned that fourteen A-Class war criminals, <br/>
including former Foreign Minister Matsuoka Yosuke, an individual who <br/>
had not died in the war and whom he blamed for his alliance with <br/>
Nazi Germany, had been secretly enshrined. His visits to Yasukuni <br/>
abruptly ended, but he continued to send imperial family members to <br/>
attend the shrine's spring and autumn rites, a practice that <br/>
continues to this day. Akihito has never visited Yasukuni.[4] <br/>
<br/>
For four straight decades, from the mid-1950s through the late <br/>
1980s, Japan's economy had grown, holding in check the undemocratic <br/>
tendencies of its polity. During that time, Yasukuni, together with <br/>
the Central Association of Shinto Shrines, its main support <br/>
organization, repeatedly attempted to regain state protection and <br/>
revive the practice of official public visits by ministers of state. <br/>
A concurrence of crises at the end of the 1980s -- the temporary <br/>
weakening of the LDP, Hirohito's death, and the end of the cold war -<br/>
- soon altered the political atmosphere in Japan.<br/>
<br/>
Nationalism is once again on the rise throughout East Asia. Japan, <br/>
having sent troops to Iraq and accommodated to post 9/11 U.S. <br/>
strategic planning, has entered a stage that could produce <br/>
irrevocable alterations in its constitutional provisions and image <br/>
as a peace state. The ruling conservative politicians have turned to <br/>
legal compulsion to force patriotic expression, and increasingly <br/>
seek to impart only one subjective meaning to it, which all must <br/>
embrace. Singing the national anthem (kimigayo) and raising the sun <br/>
flag (hinomaru) during school entrance and graduation ceremonies are <br/>
typical examples.<br/>
<br/>
Recent efforts to revise Japan's Basic Education Law also reveal <br/>
restorationist impulses that are stirring again beneath the surface <br/>
of conservative politics. The present Education Law, for example, <br/>
was enacted in 1947, nearly two years after defeat, in reaction to <br/>
Emperor Meiji's Education Rescript, which had disavowed universal <br/>
ideals and promoted militarism, loyalty, and filial piety. In the <br/>
current post-9/11 situation the two leading business federations <br/>
(Keidanren and Doyukai) and the leading political parties blame the <br/>
Education Law for the ills of society and seek to rewrite it along <br/>
with the Constitution. Rather than address real economic problems <br/>
and the dissolution of middle class social norms that lie behind the <br/>
present tribulations of Japan's school system, conservative <br/>
politicians pose as guardians of morality and rush ahead with <br/>
revision schemes.[5] <br/>
<br/>
The same restorationist inclination can be seen in the way some of <br/>
Japan's elites cling to their old perceptions of the Japan-China War <br/>
and Pacific War, ignoring differences with China and Korea. The <br/>
behavior of Prime Minister Koizumi well illustrates the problem. <br/>
Koizumi follows in the footsteps of former prime minister Nakasone, <br/>
but unlike Nakasone he persists in visiting Yasukuni despite <br/>
diplomatic protests and demonstrations in China and Korea. The <br/>
postwar Yasukuni re-presents the prewar view of Japan's modern wars <br/>
and actively combats the results of the Tokyo Trials. Thus Koizumi's <br/>
visits highlight the gap in historical consciousness between Japan <br/>
and the Asian neighbors it attacked and occupied during the first <br/>
half of the twentieth century. His actions carry the danger of <br/>
jeopardizing critically important economic ties. Were it not for the <br/>
willingness of all sides to keep politics and economics separate, <br/>
their respective nationalisms could narrow and spiral out of <br/>
control. For Korea and China also remain locked into pre-World War <br/>
II images of Japan.<br/>
<br/>
In Japan neo-nationalist views of the lost war have moved into the <br/>
mainstream, but public opinion remains divided over Koizumi's stand <br/>
on official visits to Yasukuni, with more than half opposing them. <br/>
At the same time, the public also strongly supports revision of the <br/>
Imperial Household Law to accommodate a future female successor to <br/>
the throne. Unfortunately, there has been no public debate, as yet, <br/>
over far more fundamental questions: What is the relationship <br/>
between the symbol monarchy and Japanese democracy in a time of <br/>
rising nationalism? Should the monarchy, predicated on gender <br/>
discrimination and inseparably connected with Yasukuni Shrine, be <br/>
removed from the Constitution? Should it even continue to exist in <br/>
the Twenty-First Century? If it should, then on what grounds, and at <br/>
what cost to the constitutional rights and freedoms of imperial <br/>
family members?[6] <br/>
<br/>
Finally, if Japan is to protect its democratic institutions and <br/>
rebuild political relations with China and Korea, then public debate <br/>
over the Security Treaty with the United States must also be <br/>
reopened, and the historical legacy of that military alliance <br/>
reassessed to prevent Japan's Pentagon ties from undermining its <br/>
democratic processes. Mass movements demanding the ouster of all <br/>
U.S. bases on Japanese soil could stiffen the will of Japanese <br/>
politicians and force them to place relations with Washington on a <br/>
new foundation. For U.S. political elites seek to perpetuate Japan's <br/>
energy dependency, limit its diplomatic options, and check its <br/>
tendency to draw closer to its neighbors in an economic community <br/>
that could be of benefit to all peoples of the East Asian region. <br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>This has often been discussed before but I'll give you some names <br/>
again:<br/>
<br/>
Choshu in the Meiji Restoration by Albert Craig is excellent. First <br/>
published in 1961 it was reissued by Lexington Books in 2000. Plenty <br/>
of info on Yoshida Shoin and his pupils. Analysis of the clan structure <br/>
and the factors that made Choshu the main clan to challenge the <br/>
bakufu.<br/>
<br/>
There is a Yoshida Shoin society in Yamaguchi prefecture which issues <br/>
information about him in English and Japanese and if you want it I will <br/>
look out their email address.<br/>
<br/>
Sakamoto Ryoma and the Meiji Restoration by Marius B Jensen, also <br/>
first published in 1961 (when the Meiji Restoration and bakumatsu <br/>
history were hot topics among US historians) and resissued in 1994 by <br/>
Columbia U.P. A very good historical biography. Ryoma's life was <br/>
dramatic and romantic,  he wrote very good letters and died by <br/>
assassination too young. What a hero!<br/>
<br/>
Incidentally it's the 170th year anniversary of Ryoma's birth and there <br/>
has just been a big exhibition on his life and times in Kyoto. A friend of <br/>
mine went to see it and is sending me the catalog.<br/>
<br/>
The Making of Modern Japan (Jansen again: Harvard UP) gives a good <br/>
overview of the bakumatsu as well as the Tokugawa state, with some <br/>
fascinating illustrations.<br/>

have quite a lot about Takasugi Shinsaku in them, especially the Craig. To <br/>
get more information on Shinsaku - I don't know what else to suggest <br/>
unless you read Japanese abd can look at Japanese amazon for what <br/>
they've got there. I think someone (Hide?) gave a link once before.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-175828783">Thanks again Gillian... even if you wrote that you didn't understand my question your answer is what I needed!<br/>
Although I am studying japanese I am not so skilled to read easily a history book yet... but if I have to I am going to look for something about Takasugi in japanese!<br/>
Thanks again!<br/>
Cheers<br/>
