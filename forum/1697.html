<h3>History of a Sword</h3>
by <i>friopoops</i>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-876158171">I am new to this group and relatively new to the fascination and <br/>
interest in Samurai history. I have two swords that have been in my <br/>
family's possession for almost 60 years, since they returned to the <br/>
US with an older member of my family at the end of World War II. For <br/>
years I admired these swords, but only recently started to examine <br/>
them with a sense of their history. Certainly, a little knowledge can <br/>
be a dangerous thing, but every thing I learn (or think I do)leads to <br/>
more curiosity and questions.<br/>
<br/>
One sword is an Army Parade Saber that I gather is relatively common <br/>
and nothing special - except for one thing - this saber has its <br/>
original tassel.<br/>
<br/>
However, the other sword is more intriguing and of more historical <br/>
interest. The style is Kyu Gunto which I believe became popular <br/>
during the Russo/Japanese war and continued until World War II. <br/>
Removing the blade from the handle reveals the signature on the tang. <br/>
The translation I have indicates that the sword blade was forged in <br/>
the 17th century. More specifically, by a smith between 1681 and 1684.<br/>
I am just fascinated by all of this - the characters on the hidden <br/>
part of the sword blade, etc. <br/>
<br/>
Sorry for the long preamble, but this leads to three questions:<br/>
<br/>
1. I would like to know better how to care for these swords. I know <br/>
this is not the proper forum for that discussion, but if anyone could <br/>
point me toward that information somewhere, I would appreciate it.<br/>
<br/>
2. How common a practice was it for a military officer to take an old <br/>
sword, maybe a family sword, and have it configured and adapted to a <br/>
more contemporary style?<br/>
<br/>
3. I am interested in learning about the smith who forged this sword <br/>
blade in the 1680's. The name was translated for me, but I have been <br/>
unable to find information about him. He is not listed on the Samurai-<br/>
Archives site. Can anyone give me any suggestions about searching for <br/>
information about this smith?<br/>
<br/>
Thank you for offering and supporting this group.<br/>

	Welcome to the world of Nihonto, twenty years ago I started <br/>
out with a mild interest in Japanese history and martial arts. My <br/>
teacher told me to study swords, easy thought I, now half a lifetime <br/>
later I am still studying. It is a fascinating subject with something <br/>
for every interest. If you follow the above link you'll be taken to <br/>
probably the most comprehensive site on the web.<br/>
	Depending on where you live there are clubs and collectors <br/>
who will be willing to help you research your swords. There is a <br/>

happy to help if I can.<br/>

  Congratulations on your finds.  You truly have a treasure in your <br/>
possession.  The first thing that could suggest is to have it professionally <br/>
cleaned and/or polished.  The fittings that currently exist on the blade <br/>
mean little in comparison to the blade itself.  If you do manage to get it <br/>
cleaned and polished you should also get it placed into a Shirasaya.<br/>
  Bear in mind that this is not a cheap or fast process.  Professional <br/>
polishers are very backlogged and very expensive.  It could take two years <br/>
and $2000 to get your blade worked on.  But it is worth it.  It will keep <br/>
any rust currently on the blade from causing any more damage.<br/>
  I hope this helped you.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-186900665">Carlo,<br/>
<br/>
  Does not disturb me at all.<br/>
<br/>
  The furniture of this sword is in the Kyu Gunto style that I believe began or was popularized during the Russo/Japanese war. The grip is covered with an ivory colored pebbly material which I believe is the skin of a ray fish.<br/>
<br/>
  To show you how new I am to this, until a few weeks ago I did not know the blade could be removed from the handle. A friend showed me how. There is a signature on the tang, quite long - a large number of characters. My friend had someone translate the signature and was told that the smith who forged the blade worked as a smith during the 1680's.<br/>
<br/>
  So, now I am intrigued by the history of the sword and would like to see if I can find information about the smith.<br/>
<br/>
  If I can figure out how to do it, and if the moderators of the group say it is okay, I will be glad to add a few photos to the album for this group.<br/>
<br/>
  Thank you for your response and interest.<br/>

<br/>
    Mr. Moore,<br/>
<br/>
      Congratulations on your finds.  You truly have a treasure in your <br/>
    possession.  The first thing that could suggest is to have it<br/>
    professionally <br/>
    cleaned and/or polished.  The fittings that currently exist on the<br/>
  blade<br/>
<br/>
    mean little in comparison to the blade itself.  If you do manage to<br/>
  get<br/>
    it <br/>
    cleaned and polished you should also get it placed into a Shirasaya.<br/>
      Bear in mind that this is not a cheap or fast process.  Professional<br/>
<br/>
    polishers are very backlogged and very expensive.  It could take two<br/>
    years <br/>
    and $2000 to get your blade worked on.  But it is worth it.  It will<br/>
    keep <br/>
    any rust currently on the blade from causing any more damage.<br/>
      I hope this helped you.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
    Peace,<br/>
<br/>
    Matt<br/>

<h3>History of a Sword</h3>
by <i>samuariempath</i>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1841361993">In seeing the pictures it is most difinately of the Shin gunto style. <br/>
Which came into heavy use in WWII when katana became mass <br/>
produced.Prior to this time(during the meiji era 1867-1920's) the <br/>
wearing of them was outlawed all togather. Also before the meiji era <br/>
katana and wakisashi(Daisho) where worn only by the samurai class.<br/>
<br/>
Though the meiji era didn't detur the carring of swords. it was <br/>
durong this time that we see the rise of the tsueken cane sword. <br/>
Anyway back to Carlos'sword.( I imagine it to be his as i think he <br/>
started the thread) it is an interiting peice but somethings about it <br/>
vex me: Are there characters on the other side of the tang? I was <br/>
unable to gleen such information from the photo's. Also where did the <br/>
tsuka come from? it seems quite athentic but the tsuba doesn't seem <br/>
to fit, more the elongated hand guard.<br/>
<br/>
Hopefully that answered more questions than it posed<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1778386015">In response to Tom's suggestion and the help of Kitsuno, I created an album on the group site and place 4 photos in it. I have more photographs, but I didn't want to overdo. If there is a specific something that somone wants to see, I will try to accomodate.<br/>
<br/>
  By the way, I have been focusing on the history of the blade and don't think I mentioned that the sword is in a steel scabbard that is covered in leather. It was obviously used and the leather is well worn but in remarkably good shape, This is in the 4th picture in the album.<br/>

<br/>
Carlo,<br/>
<br/>
  Does not disturb me at all.<br/>
<br/>
  The furniture of this sword is in the Kyu Gunto style that I believe<br/>
began or was popularized during the Russo/Japanese war. The grip is<br/>
covered with an ivory colored pebbly material which I believe is the<br/>
skin of a ray fish.<br/>
<br/>
  To show you how new I am to this, until a few weeks ago I did not know<br/>
the blade could be removed from the handle. A friend showed me how.<br/>
There is a signature on the tang, quite long - a large number of<br/>
characters. My friend had someone translate the signature and was told<br/>
that the smith who forged the blade worked as a smith during the 1680's.<br/>
<br/>
  So, now I am intrigued by the history of the sword and would like to<br/>
see if I can find information about the smith.<br/>
<br/>
  If I can figure out how to do it, and if the moderators of the group<br/>
say it is okay, I will be glad to add a few photos to the album for this<br/>
group.<br/>
<br/>
  Thank you for your response and interest.<br/>

      Congratulations on your finds.  You truly have a treasure in your <br/>

    professionally <br/>
    cleaned and/or polished.  The fittings that currently exist on the<br/>

      Bear in mind that this is not a cheap or fast process.<br/>

    any rust currently on the blade from causing any more damage.<br/>
      I hope this helped you.<br/>

    Does not disturb me at all.<br/>
<br/>
    The furniture of this sword is in the Kyu Gunto style that I believe<br/>
  began or was popularized during the Russo/Japanese war. The grip is<br/>
  covered with an ivory colored pebbly material which I believe is the<br/>
  skin of a ray fish.<br/>
<br/>
    To show you how new I am to this, until a few weeks ago I did not know<br/>
  the blade could be removed from the handle. A friend showed me how.<br/>
  There is a signature on the tang, quite long - a large number of<br/>
  characters. My friend had someone translate the signature and was told<br/>
  that the smith who forged the blade worked as a smith during the 1680's.<br/>
<br/>
    So, now I am intrigued by the history of the sword and would like to<br/>
  see if I can find information about the smith.<br/>
<br/>
    If I can figure out how to do it, and if the moderators of the group<br/>

      Mr. Moore,<br/>
<br/>
        Congratulations on your finds.  You truly have a treasure in your <br/>
      possession.  The first thing that could suggest is to have it<br/>
      professionally <br/>
      cleaned and/or polished.  The fittings that currently exist on the<br/>
    blade<br/>
<br/>
      mean little in comparison to the blade itself.  If you do manage to<br/>
    get<br/>
      it <br/>
      cleaned and polished you should also get it placed into a Shirasaya.<br/>
        Bear in mind that this is not a cheap or fast process.<br/>
  Professional<br/>
<br/>
      polishers are very backlogged and very expensive.  It could take two<br/>
      years <br/>
      and $2000 to get your blade worked on.  But it is worth it.  It will<br/>
      keep <br/>
      any rust currently on the blade from causing any more damage.<br/>
        I hope this helped you.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
      Peace,<br/>
<br/>
      Matt<br/>

The photographs in the album are of my sword and I will try to answer some of your questions.<br/>
<br/>
  There are no characters on the other side of the tang - only on the side shown in the photo. If you see there is a flap on the leather scabbard. If you raise that flap, you can see characters written inside, on the leather. I assume this is the signature of the sword owner.<br/>
<br/>
  Regarding the tsuka and tsuba - I do not know the answers to your doubts about whether they fit together. This sword was brought home to the US at the end of World War II and it is just as you see it. The sword has been on display or in storage all that time - almost 60 years. <br/>

  In seeing the pictures it is most difinately of the Shin gunto style. <br/>
  Which came into heavy use in WWII when katana became mass <br/>
  produced.Prior to this time(during the meiji era 1867-1920's) the <br/>
  wearing of them was outlawed all togather. Also before the meiji era <br/>
  katana and wakisashi(Daisho) where worn only by the samurai class.<br/>
<br/>
  Though the meiji era didn't detur the carring of swords. it was <br/>
  durong this time that we see the rise of the tsueken cane sword. <br/>
  Anyway back to Carlos'sword.( I imagine it to be his as i think he <br/>
  started the thread) it is an interiting peice but somethings about it <br/>
  vex me: Are there characters on the other side of the tang? I was <br/>
  unable to gleen such information from the photo's. Also where did the <br/>
  tsuka come from? it seems quite athentic but the tsuba doesn't seem <br/>
  to fit, more the elongated hand guard.<br/>
<br/>
  Hopefully that answered more questions than it posed<br/>

	Nice mounts, whomever fitted the sword did well to preserve <br/>
the mei. These are certainly not rare but they don't often come with <br/>
traditional blades in them.<br/>
	I believe your mei reads Banshu ju Fujiwara Katsuyoshi saku. <br/>
Banshu is Harima so; Fujiwara Katsuyoshi of Harima made this...I am <br/>
not certain of this reading though,I should be interested in a better <br/>
shot of the signature (mei) perhaps with baby powder in it to make <br/>
the characters stand out and one more shot of the tip including the <br/>
three inches or so of temperline below it.<br/>

<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1150404174">Some information (from the book I quoted) useful for you that can handle<br/>
the blade and see it in a proper manner :<br/>
Quote...<br/>
ARMY KYU-GUNTO PATTERN<br/>
This 'Kyu-gunto', or proto-military sword, must have superseded the 1877<br/>
sword patterns with the possible exception of the cavalry type. The<br/>
introduction date has not been established; one source suggests 1874,<br/>
which must be regarded as doubtful - otherwise, the kyu-gunto would have<br/>
preceded the 1877 patterns. Dating to the end of the nineteenth century<br/>
is more likely. <br/>
Early examples are thought to have mass-produced blades but most<br/>
survivors originate from the Russo-japanese War (1904-5) and usually<br/>
display hand-forged or ancestral blades. They were carried until<br/>
superseded by shin-gunto in the early 1930s, though many senior officers<br/>
continued to carry them during the Second World War. The hilts are<br/>
gilt-finished brass with a small pierced obverse guard of sakura (cherry<br/>
blossom) design and a long, thin knucklebow. The backstrap is wholly or<br/>
partially engraved according to rank, a general officers' pattern<br/>
incorporating a kiku or chrysanthemum blossom near the pommel. The grips<br/>
are rough or polished white same (rayskin) or, in rare cases, tortoise-<br/>
shell -normally confined to swords of field and generai officers. Black<br/>
same is also sometimes found. Gilt-wire binding fills the grip grooves.<br/>
Hilts of extreme length can be found when traditional blades are<br/>
utilised. They are retained by a removable bamboo peg, the mekugi, which<br/>
passes through the blade tang. Swords with mass- produced blades have<br/>
shorter hilts that may be removed by unscrewing the pommel-top nut in<br/>
the same manner as a 'parade sabre'. A few hand-forged blades have been<br/>
found with tangs tapered and threaded far this kind of fixing. A<br/>
decorated press stud with a spring clip, set in the fuchi (collar),<br/>
engages a slot in the scabbard mouth to retain the sword. Secondary<br/>
retention by means of a leather strap and press studs is also found. The<br/>
metal scabbards are painted or nickel or chromium-plated, and have wood<br/>
liners. A second (lower) ashi or suspension mount, when present, is<br/>
normally removable; a slot on the top of the mount slides aver the<br/>
scabbard shoe. Contemporary photographs seem to indicate that the<br/>
two-ashi sty/e was used with the two-sling full dress sword belt, while<br/>
the one-ashi fitting was confined to the service belt with its single<br/>
hanger of chain or leather. Non-commissioned officers carried a similar<br/>
sword with plain brass mounts, the backstrap often lacking the side<br/>
ears. Mass- produced blades and painted metal scabbards are prevalent.<br/>
There are many variations of this sword pattern, differing largely in<br/>
quality of fittings and the amount of decoration.<br/>
...unquote.<br/>
As you can read, still remain a good possibility to have found an<br/>
ancestral blade, but more details are needed.<br/>

    happy you have found such a good blade, so I'm asking about the<br/>
  original<br/>
    description you have made of the blade, signature and furniture as I<br/>
    have missed the start of this discussion.<br/>
    This naturally if is of no disturb to you.<br/>
    Japanese blades are my hobby and I am everyday in search for new<br/>
  friends<br/>
    to talk with about Nihonto.<br/>
    With regards,<br/>

      I would be happy to answer any questions about the blade of this<br/>
    sword. I am so new at this, I don't know what you might like in the<br/>
  way<br/>
    of descriptions.<br/>

      Mr. Moore,<br/>
<br/>
        Congratulations on your finds.  You truly have a treasure in<br/>
your <br/>
      possession.  The first thing that could suggest is to have it<br/>
      professionally <br/>
      cleaned and/or polished.  The fittings that currently exist on the<br/>
    blade<br/>
<br/>
      mean little in comparison to the blade itself.  If you do manage<br/>
to<br/>
    get<br/>
      it <br/>
      cleaned and polished you should also get it placed into a<br/>
Shirasaya.<br/>
        Bear in mind that this is not a cheap or fast process.<br/>
  Professional<br/>
<br/>
      polishers are very backlogged and very expensive.  It could take<br/>
two<br/>
      years <br/>
      and $2000 to get your blade worked on.  But it is worth it.  It<br/>
will<br/>
      keep <br/>
      any rust currently on the blade from causing any more damage.<br/>
        I hope this helped you.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
      Peace,<br/>
<br/>
      Matt<br/>

<h3>R: [samuraihistory] History of a Sword</h3>
by <i>Carlo Tacchini</i>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-115616536">Ok, now I am able to see them.<br/>
Assuming that judging swords by internet pictures is a bit difficult, at<br/>
least, my suggestions are as follows: <br/>
the signature may be that translated by Tom. Sincerely I am not able to<br/>
read it correctly with the given image, but considering as hereafter, I<br/>
am doubtful about his originality. <br/>
The tang seems to me younger than said by your friend quoting it at<br/>
1680.<br/>
I am not able to see filemarks on the surface of the tang and can not<br/>
judge if the hamon is due to water or oil quenching,<br/>
the also-straightness of the blade and the wrap in leather of the<br/>
scabbard can suggest a post 1889 sword,<br/>
altought the very good conditions of all the ensamble may suggest a<br/>
sword for occupation corps of Korea.<br/>
The interesting fact is the presence of a shinogi.  <br/>
Naturally, judging a sword by few photos is a very difficult thing, also<br/>
only generally speaking.<br/>
For better judgement you have to meet personally a trustable togishi.<br/>
Wait before polish it.<br/>

  The Russo-japanese war swords are good explained in the rather<br/>
  simple-to-find book ''Military swords of Japan 1868-1945'' by Fuller<br/>
and<br/>
  Gregory. It is cheap and you can find it in Amazon. <br/>
  If you have a scanner you can send the signature to me together a<br/>
little<br/>
  description of the blade. I'll try to find your man.<br/>

<br/>
    Does not disturb me at all.<br/>
<br/>
    The furniture of this sword is in the Kyu Gunto style that I believe<br/>
  began or was popularized during the Russo/Japanese war. The grip is<br/>
  covered with an ivory colored pebbly material which I believe is the<br/>
  skin of a ray fish.<br/>
<br/>
    To show you how new I am to this, until a few weeks ago I did not<br/>
know<br/>
  the blade could be removed from the handle. A friend showed me how.<br/>
  There is a signature on the tang, quite long - a large number of<br/>
  characters. My friend had someone translate the signature and was told<br/>
  that the smith who forged the blade worked as a smith during the<br/>
1680's.<br/>
<br/>
    So, now I am intrigued by the history of the sword and would like to<br/>
  see if I can find information about the smith.<br/>
<br/>
    If I can figure out how to do it, and if the moderators of the group<br/>
  say it is okay, I will be glad to add a few photos to the album for<br/>
this<br/>
  group.<br/>
<br/>
    Thank you for your response and interest.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-858027455">Carlo-<br/>
	Scott has the translation so he can easily straighten us out <br/>
and the mountings are clearly wartime production. Without further <br/>
info though, I stand by my translation. The Nihonto Meikan lists five <br/>
Katsuyoshi using this kanji, but only one who signed in this manner. <br/>
The shodai Ise Katsuyoshi was in the school of Sengo Masashige. <br/>
Masashige was a student of the infamous Muramasa. Banshu Katsuyoshi <br/>
was originally from the Ise line of Katsuyoshi and worked around the <br/>
Tenna era (1681-1683).<br/>
	One would expect to see some characteristics of the Sengo <br/>
school in his works, thus pics of the kissaki and monouchi are <br/>
important. I agree no final determination can be made without sword <br/>
in hand, but I would posit that a faker or 'tribute' sword would <br/>
hardly choose to copy the work of a late generation smith from a <br/>
little known line.<br/>

<h3>R: R: [samuraihistory] History of a Sword</h3>
by <i>Carlo Tacchini</i>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-2041220793">The shape (ichimonji it seems to me) of the tang match with the<br/>
swordsmith's work and period? And why so slight curvature in a 17th<br/>
century blade ?<br/>
It resemble to me no ''black color'' rust in the tang but it may be due<br/>
to the flash light surely used to take the photos. The handle is rather<br/>
long, suggesting a possible ancestral blade, but... also the signature<br/>
seems to me too much well preserved for having 300 years, as the sharp<br/>
angles of the tang and mekugi-ana. Sharpness may be explained with a<br/>
borders re-shaping (saving the signature) to fit with the kyugunto<br/>
mounting but I am still not able to see filemarks, whether the kanji are<br/>
rather good visible. Without jihada, boshi and a closer image of at<br/>
least little part of the hamon is hard to determine the school. If this<br/>
patterns do not match with the signature ?<br/>
May be a new swordsmith signature of later time? Because effectively, if<br/>
old, is hard to think of a fake with such a signature, but nowadays some<br/>
fakers make the same reasoning.<br/>
Honestly, signature is the last thing I see to, while here we have to<br/>
work with it as the first step. And to be sincere, I was not able to<br/>
read it as good as you have made. I have thinked about the little label<br/>
:<br/>
surrenders swords had such a lebel to make it easy to give back<br/>
(eventually...) the blade to the formerly owner, and this may suggest<br/>
the blade was of a certain interest.<br/>
But this is not a rule in kantei (fakes of surrenders blade with<br/>
''dedications'' have a their own market...). If Scott would see at the<br/>
back of the handle and other details comparing it to the description<br/>
shown in the part of the article I have posted, may be we can argue if<br/>
the mounting was intended for a High officer, enforcing the ''ancestral<br/>
blade'' theory.<br/>
By the way, Gen. Yamashita's sword was of the same period... <br/>
Please have no trouble to refute my suggestions as I'm taking this as a<br/>
learning session, with a lot of fun.   <br/>
Thanks for your time.<br/>
Carlo<br/>

	Scott has the translation so he can easily straighten us out <br/>
and the mountings are clearly wartime production. Without further <br/>
info though, I stand by my translation. The Nihonto Meikan lists five <br/>
Katsuyoshi using this kanji, but only one who signed in this manner. <br/>
The shodai Ise Katsuyoshi was in the school of Sengo Masashige. <br/>
Masashige was a student of the infamous Muramasa. Banshu Katsuyoshi <br/>
was originally from the Ise line of Katsuyoshi and worked around the <br/>
Tenna era (1681-1683).<br/>
	One would expect to see some characteristics of the Sengo <br/>
school in his works, thus pics of the kissaki and monouchi are <br/>
important. I agree no final determination can be made without sword <br/>
in hand, but I would posit that a faker or 'tribute' sword would <br/>
hardly choose to copy the work of a late generation smith from a <br/>
little known line.<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>No but it would if the sword were suriage,<br/>
which is how it appears to my eye, this would reduce<br/>
the sori as well. Remembering that in the 1660's<br/>
a shallow curve was en vogue.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> >It resemble to me no ''black color'' rust in the tang but it may be due<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I have seen older blades that looked new,<br/>
with surprisingly little rust for all their years.<br/>
A custom handle may indicate an older blade or just the preference of <br/>
the swordsman..<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> >as the sharp<br/>

<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Yes correct kantei dictates that the signature confirms what you see <br/>
in the blade. This is why I asked for pics of the kissaki and <br/>
monouchi.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> >May be a new swordsmith signature of later time? Because effectively, if<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Granted but fakers want to sell swords, faking an obscure signature <br/>
may throw off the wary but would hardly bring enough money to be <br/>
worth the trouble. The Meikan is a listing of over 20,000 smiths <br/>
including gendai, if there is a later smith with this signature he <br/>
would turn up here. Although Banshu (Harima) did not exist after 1870 <br/>
or so, thus it would be very unlikely to turn up in a gendai sig.<br/>
	Again I ask Scott, what does his translation say, and can he <br/>
be so kind as to provide more pics. As you say we need to kantei the <br/>
sword and not the koshirae.<br/>

Anyway, I am used to European market, in which a lukystrike, as<br/>

the sori as well. Remembering that in the 1660's<br/>
a shallow curve was en vogue.<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I have seen older blades that looked new,<br/>
with surprisingly little rust for all their years.<br/>
A custom handle may indicate an older blade or just the preference of <br/>
the swordsman..<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Yes correct kantei dictates that the signature confirms what you see <br/>
in the blade. This is why I asked for pics of the kissaki and <br/>
monouchi.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> >May be a new swordsmith signature of later time? Because effectively,<br/>

<blockquote><span title="ireply"> >old, is hard to think of a fake with such a signature, but nowadays<br/>
 </span></blockquote>some<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> >fakers make the same reasoning.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Granted but fakers want to sell swords, faking an obscure signature <br/>
may throw off the wary but would hardly bring enough money to be <br/>
worth the trouble. The Meikan is a listing of over 20,000 smiths <br/>
including gendai, if there is a later smith with this signature he <br/>
would turn up here. Although Banshu (Harima) did not exist after 1870 <br/>
or so, thus it would be very unlikely to turn up in a gendai sig.<br/>
	Again I ask Scott, what does his translation say, and can he <br/>
be so kind as to provide more pics. As you say we need to kantei the <br/>
sword and not the koshirae.<br/>

more than few possibilities of this. Sadly, I'm not able to see anything<br/>
useful from the new photo of the blade. Only that it seems some rust in<br/>
the kissaki, but may be not. Naturally, also when surrender occurred,<br/>
bad blades were used to save better ones. Depend on when, how, and<br/>

in the jungle of Sumatra, Borneo or more likely Philippines (being<br/>
American) there are few possibilities of a blade exchange. Otherwise...<br/>

<h3>Re: [samuraihistory] History of a Sword</h3>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1919228815">Mr. Moore,<br/>
<br/>
  The most common way to explain the acquisition of a Nihonto at the end of <br/>
WWII is to say that is was grabbed out of a pile of weapons.  When the <br/>
Japanese surrendered they stockpiled the weapons (firearms, blades, etc) <br/>
usually at harbors, airfields, or some other major location so that the <br/>
American forces could easily collect them.  In most cases the officers in <br/>
charge of the local military units would allow the soldiers to pick through <br/>
the piles and take what they wanted.  That is how my grandfather got his <br/>
rifle and sword.<br/>
  Very rarely did a soldier kill an officer on the battlefield and take his <br/>
sword then.  For two reasons.  One, killing an officer would require getting <br/>
close enough to have killed all the other soldiers around him.  Two, they <br/>
were in the middle of a war, they would not have had time to bend down and <br/>
pick up a sword while avoiding flying bullets.<br/>
  I hope that this helps you determine how the weapons were acquired.  The <br/>
more posts I read about it the more I believe that you have a very nice <br/>
find.<br/>

<h3>R: [samuraihistory] History of a Sword</h3>
by <i>Carlo Tacchini</i>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1855510100">So much time passed... I suggest this :<br/>
- Do not make anything to the blade or the tang in order to discover<br/>
better details or, worst, in order to let it sharper. Do not touch the<br/>
blade, clean it with paper nose tissue, maintain it in the scabbard<br/>
cutting edge up. <br/>
- Search for easy and near To-ken fun club, give it personally (without<br/>
leaving them alone in their hands) for a first, direct kantei if they<br/>
agree to make it free. If they agree the blade is a traditional<br/>
hand-made and is in recoverable conditions, ask for a qualified togishi<br/>
(polisher).<br/>
-Get in touch with the togishi, asking for polish prices, usually XY U$<br/>

finish of the work all the mystery of the blade will be unveiled.<br/>
Personally, I gave to polisher also a blade that is not at present day<br/>
an investment. The price paid and the polish was superior to the market<br/>

me enough for the price paid...<br/>

<h3>R: R: [samuraihistory] History of a Sword</h3>
by <i>Carlo Tacchini</i>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1323291909">In any case, do not discourage you about the costs of polishing and<br/>
eventually of a new rest-scabbard (that I highly recommend due to the<br/>
fact the one you have is metallic), as you have a big advantage.<br/>
You haven't any buying cost. And if the blade, as probably, is hand<br/>
made, water quenched and recoverable, also if not of high quality, it<br/>
has a value superior to the costs you will involved to, and this value<br/>
can only rise in the future. If the togishi say the blade is not<br/>
recoverable, have patience but if someone ASK TO BUY the blade as it is<br/>
''not so good to be repaired'' or other, DO NOT SELL IT !!! If he want<br/>
it is the evidence that is a good blade... Search someone other.<br/>
My address is <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="mailto:tsubame1@...">tsubame1@...</a>. I'll be glade if you'll write me about<br/>
the final of this story as what is happened to you is rather rare after<br/>
more of 50 years by the surrender.<br/>
My best wishes to you and to your blade.<br/>
P.S. IMPORTANT. Buy a book about japanese swords and their maintenance.<br/>
Is VERY important that you learn how maintain correctly your blade.<br/>

  Thank you for your comments. I, too, believe that I should get this <br/>
sword and its blade into the hands of an expert. I am working on a <br/>
way to do that and think that I will within a couple of weeks.<br/>

	The new pics unfortunately don't help, though it is clear you <br/>
have a healthy boshi not much else is apparent. Don't feel bad lots <br/>
of people have trouble capturing the details in photos. I can tell <br/>
you the name in side the combat cover is Morimoto. Not enough info to <br/>
do much with but I suspect it is the owners name. Look for Fuller and <br/>
Gregorys' book on swprds of Imperial Japan for more on your koshirae.<br/>
	For more on the sword and the smith I suggest attending a <br/>
sword club meeting iof there is one in your area. If not you could <br/>
mail a rubbing of the nakago to a knowledgeable person, though with <br/>
the info you have you could do a lot on your own. I would look for <br/>
info on Muramasa and Masashige and if you can find them pictures and <br/>
oshigata of their work. Let me know if I can help.<br/>

  You have already been a tremendous help. There is a club listed in my<br/>
area, Houston, Texas, and several weeks ago I sent an e-mail to the contact<br/>
listed on the Japanese Sword Index web site, but it was returned as<br/>
undeliverable. Now, I am e-mailing again in case the e-mail address has been<br/>
updated. (I can't remember if it is the same address.)<br/>
<br/>
  Also, there is a Japanese Sword & Art Show in San Antonio on Memorial Day<br/>
weekend. The show's organizer seemed helpful when I talked to him on the<br/>
phone and I am trying to work it out to attend it at least one day. So,<br/>
maybe, one way or the other I will get some "hands on" look at the sword and<br/>
can quit bugging you and the other gracious members of this group. If I get<br/>
to the show, I will be able to see a variety of swords and other art items.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-2113737231">Mr. Moore,<br/>
<br/>
  For the sake of keeping the blade in good condition until you get it <br/>
professionally cleaned and polished I suggest that you completely take all <br/>
of the furniture off of it.  You can put them all in a box or something if <br/>
you wish.  Furniture is not often all that valuable, except in rare cases.  <br/>
If and when you do get a small cleaning kit be VERY sure not to get any oil <br/>
on the tang.  The small kits are about $30 at any martial arts supply site.  <br/>
If you do manage to get one and need help with the cleaning procedure please <br/>
feel free to ask me, I will be more than happy to help.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Peace,<br/>
