<h3>Seven Samurai DVD</h3>
by <i>bitz_place</i>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-2147198426">Hi,<br/>
<br/>
Does anyone know if there is a definitive version of the Seven Samurai to <br/>
get on DVD (english subtitles), what it is and where to get it please...I <br/>
keep seeing versions with different play times on the websites with R2 some <br/>
20 minutes short on R1 in some cases.  There seem to be several different <br/>
versions available although that may be the add ons rather than cuts for <br/>
the different licencing regimes.<br/>
<br/>
I was blown away the first time I saw this film...I have other films where <br/>
there are clear cuts for violence which annoy me because they're so obvious <br/>
and I don't recall them having been there before...eg in one film a rider <br/>
being toppled off a fallen horse is missing because they thought the UK <br/>
public would find it distressing....(it wasn't hurt apparently).  He's <br/>
shown getting up but the incident is missing here...but not in the US.<br/>
<br/>
I don't want my memory of this film to be tainted in a similar way...I'm in <br/>
the UK but have a Multi Region player.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks<br/>
<br/>
Howard<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-237517754">You NEED to get the 'Criterion Collection' version - it is one of <br/>
the best done DVDs I've ever seen.  It has English subtitles <br/>
(optional) and the best commentary track I've ever heard.  It has <br/>
also been remastered, and looks far more crisp than any prior <br/>
version.<br/>

<br/>
Criterion also did a new DVD version of "rashomon", and that is not <br/>
only excellent, but it also has an English dubbed track that <br/>
(shockingly) is perfect! (I almost always despise English dubbing on <br/>
Japanese movies) So I'd also recommend Rashomon from Criterion.  I <br/>
just can't wait until RAN gets done by Criterion.  The existing DVD <br/>
for RAN is the most pathetic and disapointing DVD transfer I've ever <br/>
seen, no option to turn off the subtitles, and no quality <br/>
restoration for the picture or sound...!<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-2139717201">Hi,<br/>
<br/>
Thanks, I've taken a look, this one seems to be a 1.33:1 screen format, <br/>
I've also seen one being advertised 2.35:1 is that right...or has some got <br/>
things a little awry?  The version below also seems to be on www.cd-wow.com <br/>
and a little cheaper too ($7-8?).<br/>
<br/>
Thanks for your help.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-277029716">From what I read, Kurosawa originally filmed the movie in 1.33, he <br/>
didn't start filming 'widescreen' until after Seven Samurai.  I <br/>
don't really know what that means in 'movie talk' but I guess <br/>
essentially what it means is that the movie was not made for <br/>
widescreen.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1503420560">Looks like they may have made a bit of a faux pas then...I'll ask a <br/>
few questions in case, but I suspect the result is fairly <br/>
predictable.  If I get a different response I'll let you know.  I <br/>
haven't been able to throw up anything on the web to say that it was <br/>
filmed in any other format than what you say.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks again<br/>
