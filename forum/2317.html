<div id="ygrps-yiv-887479840">Dear James:<br/>
Fundamentally, I agree with your point.<br/>
However, when I first read the book on the Manchurian<br/>
conquest of China, I got an impression that the main<br/>
causes of the Chinese defeat was their insufficient<br/>
understanding in the use of firearms at the battle<br/>
field.<br/>
<br/>
Actually, a Korean(Chosun dynasty) general, who ran<br/>
the first major counter-offensive in the land,<br/>
employed the same tactics as Manchurians' against the<br/>
Japanese leading troops.(Unlike in the Navy, Canons<br/>
were not popularly used in the ground because of<br/>
difficulty in mobility) Despite his initial success,<br/>
his troop was completely annihilated. Almost all of<br/>
20,000(?) soldiers were killed. <br/>
<br/>
So, the composition of tactical units does play a role<br/>
in the battle. But, it is still a commander who<br/>
determines the fotunes of the battle.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
                        Sincerely,<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
