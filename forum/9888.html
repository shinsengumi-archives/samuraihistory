<div id="ygrps-yiv-88176540">Yea... it actually took three nights to build the original structure.. then, LATER ON, all the complicated Nice-ities were added..<br/>
 <br/>
 But the actuall "battle ready fort" was done in three nights.<br/>
 <br/>
������ In the city of Konan, there is a Maeno family document which reveals alot about the Hachisuka, Maeno, Toyotomi, and Oda Nobunaga which is not recorded in other records....<br/>
 <br/>
.... might be worth looking into. Again, it contradicts some "accepted history"... so fair warning.  For example, it says that Toyotomi was actually working as a spy for the Hachisuka in the beginning--- that he was not a peasant at all, but a low ranking samurai working as a spy. He was hired by the Ikoma Family and it was Ikoma's daugher that introduce Toyotomi to Oda Nobunaga.<br/>
������ He worked with the Hachisuka and Maeno later on as a combination of soldier/spy... in fact, many of the samurai families from the upper Owari area (the Hachisuka, Fukushima, Kawajiri, Kumazawa, Nojiri, Nakagawa, Maeno etc.etc) of northern Nagoya, Ichinomiya, Konan, etc.etc---- most of their family history follows the "spy" version of the story--- not the "peasant" version..but then again, these families are known to have been spies themselves--- so I guess that it makes sense.<br/>
 <br/>
 So, it is worth looking into to get a very different look on it all.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-422668501">I have no idea...If you go to Konan city's webpage, they have a page about the documents... (there is an option to view the page in english)..<br/>

 <br/>
 <br/>
 ..that is about the best I can think of right now for information on it in english. <br/>
 <br/>
I know that some of those families I listed earlier would tell you those stories, but again--- that is oral history and not a text...and thus, not what you are looking for.<br/>
 This belongs to the "non-standard" history... this idea of Hideyoshi as a spy goes hand-in-hand with things like the intermarrying of the Southern Court with samurai from Owari... there are not many documents written on it.... let alone translated into english.<br/>
 <br/>
����������� Sorry =( ... I will keep an eye and ear out though and post something if I learn about an english translation.<br/>
