<h3>gun tactics</h3>
by <i>nihontonut</i>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1677767336">Volly fire of guns was first used in Japan at the battle of Nagashino in 1575. My question is, <br/>
is this the first time it was employed anywhere? When was this tactic first used in Europe?<br/>
I know the europeans were using the "broadside" in naval warfare but when was in first used<br/>
by infantry, anyone know?<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1079764858">According the book "The Military Revolution" by Geoffrey Parker(a <br/>
book which I no longer own, so am going by memory) Nobunaga's use of <br/>
volley fire was the first of it's kind, not seen in Europe until the <br/>
1590's.  Here is an excerpt from a research paper I wrote in 1997 on <br/>
the subject, for what it is worth:<br/>
<br/>
"What might be overlooked is that the technique used by Nobunaga to <br/>
keep a continuous hail of bullets flying at the enemy [at Nagashino] -<br/>
 having the front row of musketeers move to the back to reload, <br/>
allowing the next row to fire - was not even realized in Europe until <br/>
almost twenty years after Nobunaga's application, in the 1590's. <br/>
(Parker)"<br/>
<br/>
'The Military Revolution' is an excellent book and I highly recommend <br/>
it.  If anyone on this list owns it, the section on Nobunaga can be <br/>
found on page 140, where if I recall correctly he actually mentions <br/>
who and where in Europe utilized volley fire for the first time in <br/>
Europe.<br/>
<br/>
As an aside to this, my military history teacher, who held any in <br/>
disdain any non-european country (in regards to pre-modern history), <br/>
argued to me that Nobunaga's approach wasn't used until later in <br/>
Europe because it was inferior to having everyone blast away at once <br/>
which would cause greater shock and chaos in the enemy ranks, or <br/>
something essentially to that effect...  any thoughts on this?<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1638539496">Nobunaga did it before the Europeans did, but he<br/>
wasn't the first--he had it used on him by the<br/>
Ikko-ikki at Nagashima. He just perfected it and used<br/>
it to best effect at Nagashino. I'm convinced that the<br/>
REAL innovation at Nagashino was not so much the<br/>
volley fire but the conjuction of missile weapons and<br/>
natural and man-made obstacles. He integrated fires<br/>
and obstacles as well as any modern commander would. <br/>
<br/>
As to your history prof, I agree with the last<br/>
post--sounds to me like someone was trying to play<br/>
down the importance of Japanese innovation. His<br/>
reasoning makes NO military tactical sense whatsoever.<br/>
Shoot, even with a tank platoon today you have<br/>
similiar thinking in the way you'd divide the<br/>
battlefield between sections and individual<br/>
tanks--similiar concepts, so that not everyone is<br/>
shooting at the same target and there is a constant<br/>
rate of fire. <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-54233009">Yes, a large amount of gun fire would scare the bejesus out of every one, BUT we're not talking about a accuracy.. we're talking about volley fire.. if anyone knows much about European history they will remember the battle of agincourt.. the first time the british really utillized their archers against infantry and cavalry, the result: having the achers just send a volley of arrows won them the war.. I realize that reloading a matchlock goes much slower than nocking an arrow to a string, as I have been in many battle re-enactments w/ muzzleloaders, but the principal is the same.. as long as their is a sizeable force, volley fire is very effective, you dont hafta aim, just shoot in the general direction of the other army.. your bond to hit someone.. especially on an open field.. another good example is the battle of culloden when the scots faced the british.. the scots were armed only w/ swords, and the brits had brown besses.. a volley fire pretty much ended that battle.. so I <br/>
think the volley fire works better than ppl give it credit for..<br/>
