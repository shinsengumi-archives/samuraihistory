<br/>
Colin Skelton / Special to The Daily Yomiuri <br/>
<br/>
Old-fashioned kabuki serves as a fountain of inspiration for an <br/>
exciting contemporary Tokyo-based theater troupe, Ryuzanji Company. <br/>
<br/>
Founded in 1984 by director Show Ryuzanji, the group raises the <br/>
curtain on the new year with the "Ryuzanji Kabuki New Year <br/>
Performance Series" in celebration of their 20th anniversary. Two <br/>
different performances based on kabuki plays will be held during a <br/>
10-day period ending Jan. 16 at the Benisan Pit in Koto Ward, Tokyo. <br/>
<br/>
There will be 11 performances of Sakurahime Omoteura Daikitan, <br/>
adapted by Norihiko Tsukuda. The second play, Kamikakete Sango <br/>
Taisetsu (The Love-Crazed Samurai), adapted by Kiyokazu Yamamoto, <br/>
will be performed three times, with subtitles in English (Jan. 13), <br/>
Chinese (Jan. 15) and Russian (Jan. 16). Both plays are based on <br/>
stories originally written by Tsuruya Namboku. <br/>
<br/>
Japan, and in particular Tokyo, boasts a large number of smaller <br/>
experimental theater groups and individuals who are part of a <br/>
creative underground. <br/>
<br/>
Led by avant-garde artists, these small theater movements emerged in <br/>
the 1960s, born out of a rebellion against overregimented postwar <br/>
Japanese society. Ryuzanji Company shares the research-oriented and <br/>
experimental approach that characterize independent underground <br/>
theater movements. <br/>
<br/>
Director Ryuzanji is an energetic theater artist who has been active <br/>
in Japan's small theater movements since 1970. He is an accomplished <br/>
actor, producer and director, having directed over 200 plays during <br/>
his career, including Educating Mad Persons, written by Shuji <br/>
Terayama. He started Ryuzanji Company with the intention <br/>
of "facilitating a horizontal affiliation among small theater <br/>
activists." <br/>
<br/>
Consequently, Ryuzanji Company produces performances using talent <br/>
from different genres: traditional and contemporary, dance and <br/>
theater. They are also active internationally, and in 2000 were <br/>
awarded the grand prix "Best Of Fringe" for their performances of <br/>
Educating Mad Persons at the Victoria Fringe International Theater <br/>
Festival in Canada. <br/>
<br/>
Sakurahime Omoteura Daikitan is the complicated story of a high-<br/>
ranking priest who, after failing to commit suicide with his male <br/>
lover, falls in love with a beautiful young princess. Chased by the <br/>
princess' evil rogue lover, the two escape only to meet very <br/>
different fates. The priest accidentally dies, and the princess <br/>
becomes a prostitute for a short time. The central appeal of the <br/>
play is the idea of a princess becoming a prostitute, which was met <br/>
with fascination by audiences when the play was first performed in <br/>
1817. <br/>
<br/>
The main character in The Love-Crazed Samurai is taken from a famous <br/>
kabuki play, Chushingura, which is based on one of Japan's most <br/>
famous revenge vendetta episodes. The real-life incident took place <br/>
in 1702, when 47 samurai avenged their master's death. <br/>
<br/>
The protagonist in The Love-Crazed Samurai is one of these 47 <br/>
samurai. He is a ronin, or a samurai without a master, who is kicked <br/>
out of his clan when a large sum of money is stolen while he is on <br/>
guard duty. He sets about retrieving the money in order to regain <br/>
his status and lead an attack upon a rival clan that had killed his <br/>
master. <br/>
<br/>
Ryuzanji Company describes The Love-Crazed Samurai as a play about <br/>
wrongdoers, the fate of men and a woman blinded by money and about <br/>
men who deceive and kill each other in the furtherance of uchiiri, a <br/>
justified raid for a noble cause. This play is full of atrocities, <br/>
laughing at didactic stories where good always wins in the end. The <br/>
Namboku world created by playwright is dry and vacant. Kamikakete <br/>
Sango Taisetsu is full of wickedness and eros, and is a very <br/>
modernistic play. <br/>
<br/>
Ryuzanji and his company believe that kabuki is "the fountainhead of <br/>
Japanese stage art." They are inspired by the parallel themes <br/>
dealing with human interaction that exist in the ancient stories of <br/>
kabuki plays and modern-day society. Written in the language of the <br/>
time, kabuki plays often take many hours to perform, and therefore <br/>
the adaptation process requires a reduction in length of the plays <br/>
while maintaining the essence of the story itself. <br/>
<br/>
"By thoroughly modernizing the language of kabuki, we can <br/>
reconstruct kabuki from the Edo period (1603-1868) into a <br/>
contemporary play," says Ryuzanji. He adds that performing a kabuki <br/>
play written 180 years ago in the present day poses an inviting <br/>
challenge as to how people today breathe life into words written so <br/>
long ago. <br/>
<br/>
In adapting the stories, Ryuzanji has sought to create a unique <br/>
style of contemporary "Ryuzanji Kabuki." This he achieves first by <br/>
simplifying and reducing the elaborate visual spectacles often found <br/>
in kabuki plays. Second, the play is re-created through the combined <br/>
effort of all the members of the ensemble. The result is a unique <br/>
and entertaining style of performance in which the actors' physical <br/>
expression carries the story of the play. <br/>
<br/>
"Originally in kabuki there were no directors. The actors themselves <br/>
are largely responsible for creating their own part," explains <br/>
Ryuzanji. "Our performances follow this example by a very open <br/>
attitude to stage direction where the ideas of the actors, <br/>
choreographers and musicians are all given consideration in the <br/>
rehearsal process. The actors' movements and emotional expressions <br/>
become more important than the story itself. Our performances are <br/>
experimental but at the same time very entertaining." <br/>
<br/>
Traditional kabuki is performed only by male actors. Obvious <br/>
adaptations that Ryuzanji has made in The Love-Crazed Samurai <br/>
include his casting a female actress, Hiroko Ito, in the lead <br/>
samurai role, and his conscious combination of elements from kabuki <br/>
and the all-female Takarazuka Revue. <br/>
<br/>
"The main theme for both plays is war and universal judgment," <br/>
Ryuzanji says. "I feel that these themes can sometimes be more <br/>
accentuated and explained by a woman." <br/>
<br/>
Audiences can also expect original percussion music performed on <br/>
stage during performances in tune with the Ryuzanj Company's <br/>
motto: "Dancing, singing and loving." <br/>
<br/>
The company tells ancient stories through dynamic, sensitive <br/>
movements and choreographed fight scenes with contemporary relevance <br/>
in what Ryuzanji jokingly calls "Tarantino Kabuki." <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
"Sakurahime Omoteura Daikitan" will be performed Jan. 6-12 and Jan. <br/>
14-16, and "The Love-Crazed Samurai" will be performed Jan. 13, 15 <br/>
and 16, both at Benisan Pit in Koto Ward, Tokyo, a five-minute walk <br/>
from Morishita Station on the Toei Shinjuku and Oedo subway lines. <br/>
