 </span></blockquote>There are none. A small minority of martial artists - usually teenage <br/>
boys - who have no real knowledge of either modern Japan or Japanese <br/>
history who saw 'Ghost Dog' and 'Last Samurai' and who think that by <br/>
reading Hagakure that they are philosophical scholar warriors, and <br/>
call themselves "modern Samurai". They are always westerners, never <br/>
Japanese. The Japanese know better.</div>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-447374571">Good afternoon.<br/>
<br/>
I do agree in a 100% with you about this.<br/>
I think we perhaps can find a modern samurai in a<br/>
secluded zen monk who everyday practice what we now<br/>
call traditional martial arts, Iai-do, Kendo, Judo,<br/>
Kyudo and the more modern of all aikido.   But just<br/>
the characther do means that those arts are non<br/>
martial.   Besides,I think that nowdays is very hard<br/>
if not imposible to find an individual who really<br/>
lives the concept of Bushido as a samurai will do.   <br/>
Specially because I do not think that Bushido lives<br/>
nowdays as it lived 200 or 300 years ago.   I do not<br/>
want to say if this is sad or not here, but this<br/>
happens just because it is insane to compare Japan now<br/>
with the Japan of 300 years ago.   Perhaps japanese<br/>
could think in the same way, but want keeps them<br/>
rolling and living now is simply different than the<br/>
circumstances of 300 years ago.   <br/>
And please notice that I am talking about japanese<br/>
people, that is because we supouse that they now more<br/>
about this form of life than anyone else.<br/>
So now what can we say about western people.<br/>
   I want to put you an exemple :   Remember this poet<br/>
Mishima ?   Well, he commit seppuku because he think<br/>
that the Japan he was living in was dishonorable since<br/>
it has adopted western culture.   How did japanese<br/>
people, even his collegues in arms, reacted to this ? <br/>
 A  scandal... but what could be the reaction in 1870<br/>
japanese people? <br/>
<br/>
Best regards.              <br/>

I think its very hard to be 100% acurate in following<br/>
Bushido those days, therefore I dont think we may find<br/>
a modern samurai as we may know them.<br/>
There was a samurai, unfortunelly I dont recall his<br/>
name right now, who said : All is vanity.<br/>
Think about this a little bit, and add the kind of<br/>
life we live nowdays.   With all this massive<br/>
communications systems... yes, all is vanity.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>well samurai and knights were all soldiers. We still,<br/>
unfortuneately, have a need for them. Not illogical<br/>
but possible not thought out to it's conclusion.<br/>
Looking for a mideval (sp) relic instead of the actual<br/>
modern version (i.e. military) I believe is what the<br/>
poster had in mind, but let's keep in mind that later<br/>
on in samurai history guns had an important role in<br/>
battles so the poster would have to look into earlier<br/>
samurai history<br/>

 </span></blockquote>There's no other way to define it--that's what it WAS.<br/>
Someone who performs a similar role in today's society<br/>
may be compared to a samurai, but that doesn't MAKE<br/>
them one. I interact daily with Japanese Ground<br/>
Self-Defense Force officers--while they are proud of<br/>
their samurai history, they don't even call THEMSELVES<br/>
samurai. <br/>
<br/>
Samurai no longer exist. Haven't since the 1870's. End<br/>
of Story.<br/>

claiming to be a knight of the round table is an idiot. Ergo... it <br/>
doesn't matter HOW you define it, that doesn't change the fact that <br/>
the concept is RETARDED.</div>

 </span></blockquote>Let's put it this way:<br/>
<br/>
"Samurai were all soldiers. Therefore all soldiers are Samurai."<br/>
"Samurai followed Bushido. I follow Bushido. Therefore, I am a <br/>
Samurai."<br/>
<br/>
NO. NO. NO. Those are what you call a logical fallacy, and pathetic <br/>
ones at that. Ideals don't make one a Samurai, carrying swords <br/>
doesn't make one a Samurai, being in the military most definately <br/>
does not make one a Samurai - over 100 years ago, you were born into <br/>
it, a few hundred before that, you could work your way into it.  <br/>
None of that is valid anymore, the class, title, rank, and meaning <br/>
is all gone, and anyone claiming to be a 'modern Samurai' is <br/>
retarded.  They watched Ghost Dog and other propaganda, and <br/>
said, "I'm gonna be like a Sammyrai".  Why doesn't anyone grasp the <br/>
concept that saying "I'm a modern Samurai" is IDENTICAL to <br/>
saying "I'm a Modern hoplite!" "I'm a modern caveman!" "I'm a modern <br/>
egyptian sword guard!" "I'm a modern Centurion" "I'm a modern knight <br/>
of the templar!" Why is it that people can say something as inane <br/>
and stupid as "I'm a modern Samurai" and get away with it?  It is <br/>
pathetic.  Just face reality and say "I am a dork who reads the <br/>
hagakure and acts all philosophical to justify to myself why I'm <br/>
still a virgin".  This STUPID topic comes up at least twice a year, <br/>
arguing semantics is a terrible waste of time, and it gets more <br/>
aggrivating each time I see it.</div>

caste.  After all, this list is all about splitting hairs about the <br/>

<br/>
Well, maybe just to save time, just let's accept this crap. Let's <br/>
everydoby tell he is a samurai if it thinks so. Let's say the same thing <br/>
too.<br/>
Myself, I see myself as a modern dinosaur. Well I can promise anybody <br/>
here I perfectly follow the same duty code, I am pretty good at doing <br/>
nothing, just eating stuff and waiting for my own extinction or <br/>
reincarnation in a theme park on some desert island.<br/>
So I am a modern dinosaur. So cool :)<br/>

What about you ? What you guys will be?<br/>

<br/>
   Well I for one feel that if someone wants to believe they are Samuria; <br/>
then my thinking is if that is the worse thing that someone could do with thier <br/>
life; that would be a good thing.  There are bigger fish to fry.  So I am <br/>
seeing conflicting opinions.  That is good; makes the world more interesting.  So!  <br/>
My feeling on this that no one is wrong and no one is right.  Just a matter <br/>
of preference.<br/>
<br/>
  I enjoy the forum and like the information that is learned here and <br/>
everyone makes very good points for there reason for thinking in that direction.  But <br/>
hmm wondering if we are beating a dead horse. here.<br/>
