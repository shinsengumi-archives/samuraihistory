that he apparently disdained to bring along a Gatling gun detachment because <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-806828758">The gatling gun was not used until later int he war bcos of supposed confederate sympathies by Gatling... thats why it was adopted several years later and you see uses of it ont he battle field later, but domestic uses earlier..<br/>
