<h3>TO ANTHONY</h3>
by <i>shinobij</i>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1017197846">Hello Tony,<br/>
 <br/>
I was wondering, I am a complete amateur to the subject and when I try to purchase books the shelves are often dominated by books by Stephen Turnball. I have heard you mock (quite rightly) his book on the Ninja but what do you think of his other books? I have read your book on the Samurai and it is very well written but seems to contradict Turnballs's books, especially on the basic orgin of the Samurai. Are these just conflicting views? How d you view this work?<br/>
Thanks for you time<br/>
Jonny<br/>

 </span></blockquote>For the record, I don't believe I've ever mocked anything Steve's written. Given <br/>
my own position, it would be in rather bad taste. I generally stay clear of <br/>
conversations about his work. For myself, it was his big samurai history book <br/>
that was the first non-fiction book on the subject I ever read, so I owe him. <G><br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1230258574">Agreed. I think we all owe Stephen Turnbull (for the books) and Akira<br/>
Kurosawa<br/>
(for the films) - a mixture of both of them, with a dash of James Clavell<br/>
thrown in - is probably what got most of us started on this fascinating<br/>
subject and country!<br/>
For me is was Turnbulls's The Samurai: A Military History, the film<br/>
Kagemusha and the novel and TV version of Shogun.<br/>

Yes -- we owe him a lot...and I feel the same about his other <br/>
works...<br/>
