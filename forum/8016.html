<h3>New guy and slight OT</h3>

<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-758811068">Hey everyone, I'm a new member, did a stint in japan as an exchange <br/>
student, and got into the history.  Glad to find this place. I do have <br/>
a question, although not really history related, hope the OT is OK - <br/>
I'm interested in taking the Japanese language exam - not sure exactly <br/>
what it is called, but the test that has 4 levels.  I'm interested in <br/>
taking the 1st or 2nd level depending (I believe the lower the #, the <br/>
harder the test). I can read Japanese pretty well, and deal in Japanese <br/>
through my job, so I'm sure I'd knock out the 3rd and 4th levels in my <br/>
sleep. Just checking to see actually when and where you can take the <br/>
test - I'd like to take it in the second half of 2006 - I'll be moving <br/>
to Oahu, Hawaii, so maybe the University of Hawaii Manoa does the <br/>
test?  I'd do more searching around on my own, but I'm traveling for <br/>
work right now, and a little too burned out to go ahead and do yet more <br/>
research - and anyway, maybe there are people here interested in the <br/>
test as well, so hopefully a few people besides me will benefit. That <br/>
stuff aside, I look forward to an interesting interchange on Japanese <br/>
history.</div>

 </span></blockquote>The test is called the Japanese Language Proficiency Test.  You can <br/>
find information here:<br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.jees.or.jp/jlpt/en/">http://www.jees.or.jp/jlpt/en/</a><br/>
<br/>
Unfortunately, the test is only given once per year (in December), with <br/>
registration occurring between July and early September.  I don't know <br/>
off-hand whether they give it in Hawaii, but would be surprised if they <br/>
didn't.  In any event, the above site should have whatever information <br/>
you need.<br/>
