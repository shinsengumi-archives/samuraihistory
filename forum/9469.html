 </span></blockquote>He was, as you say, the eldest son of Kiyomori and his heir, but died at<br/>
a pretty inconvenient time for his clan. I don't know where you'd find<br/>
much more than a couple of paragraphs written about him in an<br/>
English-language history book though, as most of the focus on the Taira<br/>
clan is generally centred on his father. He was, like most of the other<br/>
Taira clan members, a nobleman more than a general.<br/>
 <br/>
There are a number of passages involving Shigemori in the Heike<br/>
Monogatari (Tale of the Heike), and there's a great translation from<br/>
Helen McCullough available from most online bookstores and probably some<br/>
libraries as well. The historical accuracy of the Heike Monogatri is<br/>
questionable to say the least, but the image it paints of Shigemori has<br/>
become commonly accepted, accurate or not.<br/>
