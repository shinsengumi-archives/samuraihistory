<div id="ygrps-yiv-353553233">Ruroken's creator Watsuki Nobuhiro is known to _loosely_ base his story<br/>
on real events and caracters. There has probablu been something in the<br/>
general function of the oniwabanshu in Kyoto. As said in an other mail<br/>
on sthe subject of "ninjas" and Shinobu. They have with out a doubt<br/>
existed. We just dont know very much about them, and their activites.<br/>
But then again, they were sceret spies and guerillas so it would have<br/>
been counterproductive to be known.<br/>
<br/>
As a modern paralell, There are 120 suspected spy academies around the<br/>
world. But only two publicly known. CIA's The Farm outside Washinton DC<br/>
and i think the other one is in UK or Russia. Not sure there.<br/>
Do we know what and who are training there? Nope. Not a clue. Why? sore<br/>
wa himitsu des! (as Xellos would have said)<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-982740204">Okay, as I have said before. I am no expert, but I did do a little<br/>
searchin on the net and found out this about oniwabanshu (can someone<br/>
plz tell me what that means?)<br/>
<br/>
"The Oniwabanshuu were a group of ninjas/onmitsus established by the 8th<br/>
Tokugawa shogun, Tokugawa Yoshimune (1684-1751), who is considered to be<br/>
one of Japan's greatest rulers. His far-reaching reforms totally<br/>
reshaped the central administration structure and temporarily halted the<br/>
decline of the shogunate. He was originally the head of Kii, one of the<br/>
three hereditary Japanese feudal fiefs ruled by descendants of the<br/>
original Tokugawa ruler not in the main line of succession to the<br/>
Shogunate. (The other two fiefs/hans were Owari and Mito - together, the<br/>
3 hans were known as the 3 Houses, or Sanke.) A lack of sons in the main<br/>
branch of the family, though, resulted in Yoshimune's succession to the<br/>
position of Shogun in 1716. <br/>
<br/>
Yoshimune established the Oniwabanshuu for security, information<br/>
gathering and spying activities. Originally, members of the Oniwabanshuu<br/>
were chosen from the Kii clan, and was passed down in the families - in<br/>
other words, the posts of the Oniwabanshuu were hereditary. They acted<br/>
as security guards in the Edo castle, besides spying on other clans of<br/>
their policies and actions. It was also believed that in Bakumatsu<br/>
times, Oniwabanshuu members were placed among the missions sent to<br/>
America."<br/>
<br/>
I have no knowledge in this area so I cannot verify nor deni its<br/>
authentisity.<br/>

<br/>
"niwa" means "garden", "ban" means as much as "turn" as in "now its <br/>
your turn". "Niwaban" then means as much as "guard in the garden" and <br/>
is just another term for "shinobi" or "ninja" affiliated with a <br/>
specific lord.<br/>
The "o-" at the beginning is an honorific prefix, and "-shu" (with a <br/>

"niwa" means "garden", "ban" means as much as "turn" as in "now its <br/>

is just another term for "shinobi" or "ninja" affiliated with a <br/>

  Repetative question, I know.  "Oni" is Demon, okay, all good and fine.  My <br/>
question is this: Is "Musha" a real japanese word or just something concocted <br/>
for the game of the same name?  Thanx.  8-)<br/>
