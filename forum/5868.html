<h3>Sword Lecture</h3>

We have just up-dated our web site with the transcript of an informal chat I gave at the London Arms Fair in September. This was an illustrated talk with 12 swords dating from the Kamakura to the Bakamatsu period. The transcript is a bit "sketchy" and the oshigata are rather poor but, for what its worth you may find it of some interest on www.to-ken.com under Articles.<br/>
Best regards<br/>
