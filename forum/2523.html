at the Tsuka of early curved Tachi (and not only) you'll find it<br/>
relatively shorter than that we find on Katana. And even with this<br/>
consideration, think that Samurai *were* able to control the horse<br/>
without hands. Their main weapon for centuries was the bow.<br/>

<h3>R: [samuraihistory] TACHI  and tai chi</h3>
by <i>Carlo Tacchini</i>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-2108417831">Probably my english was wrong. I meant that all tachi were intended to<br/>
be used with one hand only, from horseback, even it could be that once<br/>
dismounted the Samurai should have the possibility to handle them with<br/>
both hands. To stroke with both hands against a target on your side and<br/>
lower than you is rather difficult and probably senseless, worst if on<br/>
the left side !<br/>
But Yumi first and then Yari relegated the Tachi to a (relatively)<br/>
secondary role in horseback fighting. The assertion you made about the<br/>
control of horse is right when we speak about sword/sword or<br/>
cavalry/infantry close combat fight, but a good control could be made<br/>
also without hands on bridles when shooting arrows or fighting with<br/>
Yari. <br/>

Not sure anyone responded to this. The "chi" is not the same Chi you <br/>
are thinking of. Chinese and Japanese are based on pictographs; kanji. <br/>
They may have different "readings" but usually maintain very specific <br/>
meanings thus the character for energy, vitality (KI) can also be read <br/>
as chi. Or is it the other way round? Any way I learned the Japanese <br/>
readings which are in the end based on Chinese ones.<br/>
	The character for tachi is usually but not always two characters which <br/>
are read O,Dai (big) and To,Katana(sword) seperately but "tachi" when <br/>
in compound. The tachi in the words Odachi, Nodachi, itodachi and <br/>
kenukigatatachi is all one word one idea with no emphasis on "chi." <br/>
Seperate the chi and it loses meaning. Don't feel I'm trouncing on you <br/>
everytime I ask my Japanese friends questions like this I get the same <br/>
lecture...<br/>

The "chi" in "tai chi" is the "energy" as in "ki" (Japanese) or "chi"<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Close. The first kanji is "futo(i)" (large, fat) not "(kii)" (big). <br/>
<br/>
There is, in fact, no clear vocal connection between "tachi" the word<br/>
and the two kanji used to spell the word; in essence, the kanji seem to<br/>
be applied to an older Japanese word for meaning, rather than for<br/>
pronunciation. <br/>
<br/>
The only time you see the "dai/kii" kanji first is when it's read<br/>
"dait", which is just another word for katana, typically.<br/>
