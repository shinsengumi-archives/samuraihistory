<br/>
In this podcast we examine the myth of Japan's Samurai giving up the gun during the Edo period (1603-1868). In 1979, Professor Noel Perrin wrote a book called Giving Up the Gun, Japan's Reversion to the Sword, 1543-1879, and in this book he claims that Japan gave up the gun, or "put the genie back in the bottle" as it were, and pushes his theory to show that the contemporary nuclear arms race happening as he wrote the book could be reversed. A great thought, unfortunately in academic circles in the West and Japan, his work is not taken seriously, and the Japanese language version explicitly states that the book is not based on historical fact. Despite this, writers and scholars who do not generally focus on Japan have liberally cited his work, which has kept the myth alive. Add to that the pop-culture image of Samurai as honor-bound righteous warriors who would never do something so dishonorable as shoot an enemy from a distance, and it's easy to see why the myth has endured.<br/>
<br/>
Japan in fact didn't "give up the gun" at all. Guns were being produced and used throughout the Edo period. It was more of an issue of guns not being necessary during this time of peace, and Samurai already being armed with swords as a matter of course anyway - why bring a bulky, long-barreled muzzle-loading single-shot arquebus to a sword duel?<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1062190803">The Chinese discovered gunpowder in the 9th century.  Do I understand<br/>
correctly that the Japanese did not acquire this technology until the mid<br/>
16th century with Portuguese guns? (The route would be from China to Arabia<br/>
to Europe and from there all the way back to Japan..  This is not at all<br/>
intuitive.)  Similarly, the Chinese had movable type and a crude printing<br/>
press (via India) by the mid 11th c., the Koreans the same 3 centuries later<br/>
and apparently the Japanese even later than that.  Given the geographical<br/>
juxtaposition, the treaties, diplomatic missions, the trade, and countless<br/>
other factors, I am completely mystified that a technological advance by one<br/>
country would not be almost immediately adopted by the other two.  I demand<br/>
an explanation.  (But if that is impolite I meekly beg one.)<br/>

EP03 The History of Guns in Medieval Japan<br/>
<br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://samuraiarchives.podbean.com/2011/05/16/ep03-the-history-of-guns-in-medieval-japan/">http://samuraiarchives.podbean.com/2011/05/16/ep03-the-history-of-guns-in-medieval-japan/</a><br/>
<br/>
<br/>
"In the 3rd episode of the Samurai Archives Podcast, your hosts tackle the history of the gun in Japan prior to and including the introduction of firearms by the Portuguese in the 1540's. Contrary to popular belief, and often overlooked by historians, guns did in fact make their way into Japan as early as the 1450's, mainly through Ryukyu or to mainland Japan via China and Korea. Although they remained more of an oddity or curio until they were mass produced beginning in the 1540's, there are accounts of them in Japan long before the introduction by Western traders, which we present to you in this episode. And, for anyone who has ever wondered what the difference is between a musket, matchlock, and arquebus, we'll give you a concise explanation of the types of firearms in question."<br/>
<br/>
So, rather than reinvent the wheel here, I'd recommend a listen to the above podcast, and then follow up with questions and we'll do our best to answer them. But in a nutshell, yes, guns did arrive in Japan before the 16th century from China/Korea - just not in sufficient numbers to build an arsenal, or they were thought of as "curiosities" and not produced in Japan.<br/>

There's a significant time and effort commitment that goes into these podcasts. A little courtesy and decency would be nice. <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-390839663">Thanks, Kitsuno.  I probably should not have quoted this thread as I wasn't<br/>
asking about guns per se, but specifically gunpowder and the printing press<br/>
and generally about the development of technology in Asia.  By the time<br/>
Japan adopted the use of flintlocks, the Chinese already had cannons,<br/>
grenades, and significant development in the use of gunpowder. I do not see<br/>
where any development of uses for gunpowder occurred until after the arrival<br/>
of the Portuguese.  More importantly, the arrival of the printing press<br/>
appears to be equally disdained..  While the Chinese were printing books,<br/>
Japan still preferred writing?  I believe there are examples in textile<br/>
production and architecture as well, where significant advances were not<br/>
readily adopted.  Just curious if there might be an explanation or just an<br/>
oddity of history.  I can't find similar examples in Western history. In the<br/>
West, technology moves from country to country like wildfire, with everyone<br/>
claiming they invented it..<br/>
