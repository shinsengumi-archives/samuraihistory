 </span></blockquote>If you're doing research in medieval/premodern Japan TCTJ is an <br/>
indispensable source. It's value is given, I guess, by the fact that it <br/>
translates into English original sources written for the most in other <br/>
European languages. It has been recommended to me by my academic <br/>
advisor, Dr. Paul Varley, and I think it's an excellent resource. As <br/>
you said, it is in fact listed in almost every book dealing with <br/>
medieval/premodern Japanese history.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>I have to agree. It's a fascinating read, all things considered. SOme of the <br/>
writers are very observant and astute -- and some are remarkably parochial.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>I've read it--borrowed it from the library. It's a<br/>
great collection of observations from European<br/>
visitors during the time period. Well worth the money,<br/>
if you can find it for sale. <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-2004036119">Thanks for the advice folks, I received this book the other day and it's<br/>
fascinating. It's always interesting reading an outsiders views on<br/>
different civilizations, as there are just so many little points<br/>
discussed that you would not read about elsewhere.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks,<br/>
Angus<br/>
