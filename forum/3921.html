 </span></blockquote>What on EARTH are you asking? Who's the most<br/>
well-known samurai outside of Japan? When you think<br/>
"samurai", who's name first comes to mind? This is<br/>
about as GENERAL as you could possibly make a<br/>
question. And don't put "ANSWER ASAP"--it makes me<br/>
think you're doing this for a report or something for<br/>
your 7th grade world history class, and don't want to<br/>
bother to do any research yourself, but have to have<br/>
the paper turned in tomorrow. <br/>
<br/>
To answer the way I rephrased the question, I'd say<br/>
for the first, it's probably Miyamoto Musashi,<br/>
unfortunately. For the second, undoubtedly I think of<br/>
Oda Nobunaga.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Not necessarily. Being born into the class was an<br/>
essential part of being a samurai--you didn't<br/>
necessarily have to "serve" someone, per se, though we<br/>
all think of it as such. For instance--the highest<br/>
member of the samurai class, the daimyo, didn't<br/>
"SERVE" anyone else, really--only himself. Is he by<br/>
definition, not a samurai? Hardly.<br/>
<br/>
While I'm not a Musashi fan, he was born into the<br/>
class, as I recall, making him by definition a<br/>
samurai. <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-711015647">Hey.<br/>
       At the risk of being branded heretical, I personally wouldn't have <br/>
even thought of Musashi.  To me "Musashi" is the first set of sounds of a name of <br/>
a sumo heya (Musashigawa) and part of the shikona of the last yokozuna to <br/>
retire (Musashimaru), and that was the only thing I associated it with.<br/>
       To me, my top two choices (although they aren't necessarily my <br/>
favourites) would be 1. Hideyoshi and 2. Nobunaga.  Uesugi Kenshin, Takeda Shingen, <br/>
Akechi Mitsuhide and Tokugawa Ieyasu would round out my top six, followed <br/>
closely by Shibata Katsuie and (maybe) Mori Motonari and Saito Dosan, but those two <br/>
are stretches.<br/>
       And thanx for the business reading recommendation.  I'll have to dig <br/>
up the copy I typed out in college.  (And yes, I actually typed out Art of War <br/>
-- word for blasted word -- as typing practice my freshman year for the hell <br/>
of it.)  :-)<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Even if you are in the minority, it's not heretical to<br/>
have a better idea...that's why I asked what the point<br/>
of the question was--if their looking for the "ideal"<br/>
samurai, etc., then I'd point to Yamanaka Shikanosuke<br/>
(that is, until the very end...). As far as who I<br/>
"first" think of when the word is said, I probably<br/>
think of Nobunaga, but when I mentioned Musashi, it<br/>
was not my thinking, but unfortunately what I think<br/>
most people in the West would say. <br/>

 </span></blockquote>This information was taken from:<br/>
Cleary, Thomas The Japanese Art of War Shambala 1991 <br/>
Miyamoto Musashi (trans. Thomas Cleary) The Book of Five Rings <br/>
Shambala 1994 <br/>
Turnbull, Stephen The Lone Samurai and the Martial Arts Arms and <br/>
Armour 1990 <br/>
Yoshikawa Eiji Musashi Kodansha 1981<br/>
<br/>
Much of Musashi's life between 1600 and 1640 is the stuff of legend <br/>
and some have postulated that he served at Osaka Castle (1614-1615) <br/>
on the defending side, taking quite a few heads in the process. In a <br/>
similar vein, he is sometimes said to have helped quell the Shimabara <br/>
Rebellion of 1638 - a theory which, as with his glories at Osaka, is <br/>
impossible to prove.<br/>
<br/>
On the other hand, many of the important events depicted in Yoshikawa <br/>
Eiji's famous novel Musashi have a basis in reality, to include his <br/>
battle with the Yoshioka School<br/>
<br/>
Musashi has enjoyed an immense popularity in the 20th Century and <br/>
beyond, largely as a result of Yoshikawa's novel (which was <br/>
originally published in serialized form in the Asahi Shimbun). <br/>
Musashi skillfully weaves fact and fiction together to create an <br/>
engrossing tale that has experienced increasing reknown in the West. <br/>
Interestingly, the Asahi Shimbun noted in 1988 that at least one Edo <br/>
Period source questioned Musashi's duel with Sasaki, stating that <br/>
Musashi was not alone at the fight, and that his followers killed <br/>
Ganryu when he had been knocked down to the ground</div>

  Posed to my students. My replies were Nobunaga Oda, Uesugi Kenshin, <br/>

Of course this was two ladies in thier mid-50's. Musashi NEVER came up.<br/>

Ok, he was born in the samurai class, but in the end he had no lord, <br/>
right?<br/>
So, can't we disqualify him?<br/>

I think Nobunaga should be #1, for the way he lived and died.<br/>

<br/>
Nate was kind enough to address a similar question I´ve posed. His remarks are very interesting. Perhaps you can rummage throughout the archives to retrieve it.<br/>
<br/>
On European Feudal and Ancient systems, the sole fact of birth was enough to qualify entrance to a class. However, before Japanese standarts, the lord-serf (is there a better term? In portuguese we have "vassalagem", which I would translate as "retainership") relationship was essential, or wasn´t it? If it wasn´t essential, what´s the purpose of the concept of "ronin"?  <br/>
<br/>
Cheers,<br/>
<br/>
Thiago<br/>

p.s.: btw, CEPO, are you an Italian Citizen? Please reply pvt, I would like to pose a few questions on Italy.<br/>
p.s.2: Octavio, do you undergo trainning at the Niten Institute in Brazil?<br/>
