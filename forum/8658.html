I am not sure of the total number of entries, but<br/>
there will only be one winner and one runner up prize<br/>
given. Unfortunately, not enough people entered to<br/>
have competitions for each genre. You can't give a<br/>
prize to someone if they are the only one within that<br/>
genre's entries. <br/>

 </span></blockquote>Im at an airport right now, but off the top of my head I think there <br/>
were 7 entries (I think there were 8 last year, so the people who put <br/>
it off too late this year can get started now, since it will happen <br/>
again next year) so the prize should be $70 minus 5%. Again, off the <br/>
top of my head - I think the entries ranged from historical fiction, <br/>
pulp fiction, what if, and ghost stories, but Ive probably missed one <br/>
or two genres. The judging will start within 24 hours.</div>
