<h3>Musashi & Suburito</h3>
by <i>samurai_iaijutsu</i>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-380511008">Guys,<br/>
<br/>
Does anyone know the true story of Musashi when he was about to duel <br/>
with Sasaki Kojiro. He was on the small boat and made a bokken (later <br/>
called suburito) from an oar?<br/>
<br/>
On the movie starring Mifune, he was actually bringing his sword but he <br/>
picked an oar to use for the duel as he was asked by the boat-man, why <br/>
do you make a bokken and not use your sword? Musashi said: "I like the <br/>
size". While other source on website saying the Musashi actually forgot <br/>
his sword and he had to make a bokken from an oar.<br/>
<br/>
Here is the excerpt from the site: "Musashi Miyamoto, arguably Japan's <br/>
greatest swordsman, overslept one morning. He was due to meet one of his <br/>
many challengers and was already running late. As he bolted from his bed <br/>
to the door, he, incredibly, forgot his sword!! Hastily, he boarded the <br/>
small boat that was to take him to a small island (sandbar) where his <br/>
armed opponent awaited him anxiously. Realizing his predicament along <br/>
the way, he grabbed one of the boat's oars and, with a small knife, <br/>
began whittling a crudely-shaped katana from it. Arriving at his <br/>
destination, Musashi greeted his adversary. The man laughed and <br/>
confidently drew his weapon and attacked the awaiting Musashi. With a <br/>
swift series of graceful movements, Musashi expertly defended himself <br/>
and quickly dispatched the over-zealous opponent by crushing his <br/>
skull!!! ... and so was born the Suburito."<br/>
<br/>
The question is, did Musashi actually forget his sword and have to make <br/>
a bokken from an oar or did he actually like the size of the oar and <br/>
prefer using it to using his sword?<br/>
<br/>
Thanks.<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Short answer - no - no-one knows, as there are no records of the duel.<br/>
<br/>
That a duelist should forget his weapon is patent nonsense, and shows<br/>
how a myth collects in time.<br/>
<br/>
One aspect of the duel often ignored is the psychological ploys<br/>
employed to unsettle one's opponent. Musashi employed them (from what<br/>
we read), such as arriving early and waiting in ambush, arriving late,<br/>
etc.<br/>
<br/>
Other swordsmen used similar techniques - Nobutsuna Kamiizumi once<br/>
asked an opponent to wait until a student had arrived.<br/>
<br/>
Toda Seigan faced an opponent with a bokken, so the man put away his<br/>
sword and used a bokken too, not to be out-done. Seigan then put down<br/>
the bokken and picked up a stick.<br/>
<br/>
I have read somewhere that there is a view that Musashi had his<br/>
students waiting in hiding on the island, and it was they who ambushed<br/>
and killed Kojiro.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1673951691">Off course exist records about that fight. Several years after the death of Musashi was wrote a compilation with the testimonies of the witnesses of this event. The book was called "Niten-Ki", the first biography of Musashi. In the book one of the chapters had a info about Musashi, accord this text he had both swords in the duel. <br/>
 <br/>
He left the Daito in the boat and took the Shoto and the Suburito with him.  In the fight he just used the Suburito.<br/>
 <br/>
I have a resume of  this book but in spanish and my english is bad.<br/>

The Lone Samurai, The life of Miyamoto Musashi. <br/>
Writen by WIlliam Scott Wilson.<br/>
<br/>
It covers a lot of the aspects of Musashi's live from his duels to his<br/>
skills in painting. It also mentioned conflicting informations etc.<br/>

If you like to read more about the real man thats a place to start.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-663764995">Dear Totok san,<br/>
                         I hope I have your name right.The story I remember was Musashi knew his younger opponent was perhaps a more skilled swords man than him self .He purposefully kept his opponent waiting as a sign of disrespect.He also knew the exact length of his opponents blade and fashioned a boken out of an ore a few inches longer than his opponents blade .As his younger now impatient opponent rushed in he threw his saya away to which Musashi added the words as a spur 'that's right throw it away you won't need it where you're going.'The opponent was subsequently slain by the longer reach of Musashi's weapon and his own impatience . This clearly demonstrates many percepts contained in the book of five rings from knowing your opponent to knowing the lay of the land to applying strategy and more .Unfortunately I cannot quote any sources with any veracity.Hope this helps any way.<br/>

so he could catch the tide out from the assasins<br/>
waiting to kill him if he won<br/>
