TWO MESSAGES, The first adressed to Mr. Baker,<br/>
The SECOND adressed to Mr. Frazier<br/>
<br/>
========================================<br/>
<br/>
TO: MR. BAKER,<br/>
<br/>
Thank you.<br/>
<br/>
Even after I bite your head off, (which you apologised for provoking anyway out of a good heart, even though you were not wrong in<br/>
the first place), you then stand up for me.<br/>
You are a very kind person, and I am sorry to you for any insult that I made to you, ever.<br/>
Whether you were wrong or not is not the case as you were not wrong to express your opinion in the first place and meant no offence<br/>
anyway.<br/>
Therefore I was wrong and apologise to you.<br/>

<br/>
* Did you invent the Hakama and devise it's uses? I believe that you didn't. You only know of it's uses inside Budo as you learn it,<br/>

<br/>
* Who mentioned movies? Who mentioned historically correct details regarding the ninja? How would you be an authority on the ninja?<br/>
* You study Budo by your own admission. It is very rude by every cultures beliefs to denounce that of which you are ignorant.<br/>
<br/>
* And ignorant of such matters you are.<br/>
<br/>

authors<br/>

<br/>

It is apparent that YOU are the one not reading. You seem to be so wrapped<br/>

** Let me just quote you on this one first. "Did you invent the Hakama and<br/>
devise it's uses? I believe that you didn't. You only know of it's uses<br/>
inside Budo as you learn it, and are in no position to comment on any other<br/>
arts uses of the hakama."<br/>
** What I had to say was not intended or designed to question anything. You<br/>
slammed him for expressing what he was taught, and I was trying to show that<br/>
different arts are taught different things. He wasn't wrong by having<br/>
incomplete information. You, on the other hand, were very wrong in being so<br/>
rude about it as though you were the authority on the subject.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
><br/>
> > However, regardless of any one teaching, you must consider the fact that<br/>
the hakama was Japanese<br/>
><br/>
> * Who said that the Hakama wasn't/isn't Japanese? NO-ONE.<br/>
** Lovely how you broke this sentence in half to twist its meaning.<br/>
><br/>
> > not the tool of martial arts.<br/>
><br/>
> * And how do you then account for it's additional and specific uses in the<br/>
arts?<br/>
** I account for it the same way I account for Indians discovering the added<br/>
bonus of a warm pelt after eating the buffalo. The Japanese wore it, and<br/>
wonder of wonders, it was really easy to move in it. Go figure.<br/>
> * It is in fact BOTH, Japanese and a TOOL of the arts.<br/>
> * You seem to have missed this.<br/>

> > It was worn by practitioners and "lay" folk alike.<br/>
><br/>
> * Who said that it wasn't worn by many kinds of people? NO-ONE.<br/>
** By bringing up the point that everyone wore them, I was simply showing<br/>
that it was not designed for any specific martial purpose. It was a garment.<br/>
And your comments as referenced above were unnecessary.<br/>

><br/>

** Ummm, you did! Let me go ahead and quote you again. "Did you invent the<br/>
Hakama and devise it's uses? I believe that you didn't. You only know of<br/>
it's uses inside Budo as you learn it, and are in no position to comment on<br/>

** Seems to me that I was right on target about everything I had to say. You<br/>
should consider being a writer. They are all touchy and critical like you,<br/>
and they love rebutting criticism over even a single word.<br/>

 Firstly I should put my position here on the board...I feel that the amount <br/>
of useless bickering here in the past has simply been a waste of time, space <br/>
and thought on the parts of all involved..Maybe he was right...Maybe he <br/>
wasn't..bottom line is what do we accomplish from it either way? Nothing! <br/>
Please...from now on lets keep it all based on the acquiring of knowledge <br/>
about the Samurai..and not let it disintegrate into one big 'Sengoku <br/>
Jidai'!!!!<br/>
 Kumo..thanks for the apology to everyone..it shows your spirit..Can we now <br/>
please get on with the REAL questions?<br/>
