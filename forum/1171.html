Answer to Question.2.<br/>
The War of 1180-85 ended with the annihilation of the<br/>
Taira and their infant Emperor, the infant Antoku . As<br/>
a result Minamoto no Yoritomo became the predominant<br/>
warlord, removing the potential threat of his brother<br/>
Yoshitsune and establishing himself, ably handling<br/>
relations between himself, the religious sects, and<br/>
the imperial Court . As a result, he established the<br/>
Kamakura bakufu (shogunate) in 1192 .<br/>
Hope this helps<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-456887668">Kwaidan is one of my favorite all time Jpanese movies, or any movie <br/>
for that matter, and the Hoichi episode is the best of the movie.  <br/>
This is all taken from Hearn's work but is from the Heike originally, <br/>
and if you can get through the somewhat archaic writing, it is well <br/>
worth the read.<br/>
