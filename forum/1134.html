<h3>Followup on armor exhibit in Dallas</h3>
by <i>Niblet0</i>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-837812410">So sorry about not getting more info sooner but I've got it now.<br/>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <br/>
The exhibit is being held in Dallas/Ft. Worth and GREATER NEWS... they've extended the exhibit until January of 2003.  It is being held in the Arts District at the perminant museum of Crow Collections of Asian Art.  The entire museum is dedicated to the Asian art of mainly China and some from India, but right now the exhibit from a private collection of Japanese armor is on display until NEXT YEAR!!!<br/>
 <br/>
It is a truly amazing thing to see and the cost??? totally free!  The down side is that there isn't a whole lot to see of the armor so I wouldn't recommend any out of towners plan a trip unless you're just that insanely serious.  The Crow Collection of Asian Art Museum is across the street from the Dallas Museum of Art.<br/>
 <br/>
The web-site for Crow Collection is www.crowcollection.com I believe.<br/>
 <br/>
If you have a chance to go see this exhibit I would highly recommend it.  It's like seeing it in real life is like making those pictures and reading about it in books a reality.<br/>
