enquiry. But I sympathise. I am an archaeologist, mostly <br/>

What is really required is a project that can unite <br/>

This would depend for its success upon a significant <br/>

there are far more Japanese medievalists who speak/read <br/>

 </span></blockquote>In a nutshell: the basic materials of stone timber and <br/>
earth employed in castle building were the same, although <br/>
the way in which they were used i.e. methods of <br/>
construction and layout were quite different.<br/>
<br/>
The principle similarity is in a functional sense in that <br/>
both European and Japanese castles were the defended <br/>
residences of feudal lords, and therefore were <br/>
multifunctional complexes fulfilling  administrative, <br/>
economic, residential, and probably only occasionally, <br/>
military roles.<br/>
I must say I am envious, as I haven't seen any Japanese <br/>
castles "in the flesh". Do you have any interesting <br/>
pictures?<br/>

 </span></blockquote>I've uploaded 3 pictures to this list that I had on hand, available <br/>
at the 'files' link on the righthand side of the listserve homepage.  <br/>
I can't find any other of my pictures at the moment, but these were <br/>
taken at the remains of a caslte in Saiki, Oita prefecture, Japan.  I <br/>
don't remember the name of the castle, but I believe it predates the <br/>
Sengoku period.  I have to assume that the remains are mostly <br/>
foundation, because I am under the impression that Japanese castles <br/>
used more wood than European ones.  The 'viewfromcastle' picture is <br/>
just that - a view from the castle, just to give an idea of location. <br/>
it had a 360 degree view of the surrounding area, and the hike to the <br/>
top is a steep, winding and wooded road, ideal for defense.<br/>
<br/>
It wasn't until I returned to the USA and took a Japanese Art History <br/>
class did I learn to take multiple pictures of the same <br/>
building/object from different angles for later study - that helped <br/>
me out later when I returned to Kyoto, but I have yet to return to <br/>
Kyushu to get more pics of the castles...<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1115769468">For me, the most interesting castles are the remains of the <br/>
originals.  Omura castle in Omura, Nagasaki is amazing - all that is <br/>
left is the foundation and some walls, but one side of the wall is <br/>
about 50 feet strait up.  I didnt have my camera with me at that <br/>
point, but I was able to climb up the side of the wall.  The castle <br/>
itself wasnt really on a hill, but the foundation was build up so <br/>
high, it appeared that it could have been well fortified.  Castles <br/>
like momoyama and osaka are interesting, but something about those <br/>
concrete monsters just don't fly with me...  or maybe the kids <br/>
themepark within spitting distance of Momoyama castle turned me off.  <br/>

<h3>Re: Japanese Use of Cavalry</h3>
by <i>tom.davidson@realtime.co.uk</i>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-812416796">Hi Nathan - <br/>
<br/>
Thought I'd reply, not from any great scholastic viewpoint, but as an eclectically-read Sengoku buff like <br/>
yourself.<br/>
<br/>
I think the first thing I'd say is that the samurai never employed cavalry 'units' such as you and I understand <br/>
them. This stems from the early samurai days, when the way of the warrior was 'the way of the horse and the <br/>
bow', and the mounted warrior would go to battle with one or more 'footmen' as we might call it, as much as <br/>
he could afford. The unchanging nature of samurai culture over almost the entire warrior period meant that <br/>
this practice was carried through from the upper strata of samurai to the low - armies were raised be levies, <br/>
holders of land having to supply themselves and a number of men, some mounted, some on foot, fully armed <br/>
and ready for battle, according to their wealth, which was determined by their income from landholdings. This <br/>
meant that even through to the late Sengoku days, daimyo armies bore a greater resemblance to early <br/>
medieval warbands than to organised military units.<br/>
<br/>
The emergence of ashigaru - the lightfoot - in the Onin Jidai increased the proportion of footsoldiers to <br/>
mounted, and samurai armies swelled in size, but two armies, be they or 10,000 or 100,000 men each, would <br/>
not necessarily conform to the same proportion of horse and foot, nor to the disribution of arms within the <br/>
armies. Oda Nobunaga's armies, apparently, were known for their significant percentage of ill-trained <br/>
footsoldiers armed with long spears. Tokugawa armies evolved, I believe, with a significantly larger percentage <br/>
of 'reliable' troops at all levels (this might reflect the fact that Oda was a cruel commander who often turned <br/>
on his own retainers. Tokugawa never struck against one of his own without a valid reason, which would have <br/>
increased his attraction in the alliance stakes - you could trust him more than the others). What the ashigaru <br/>
did bring was a need to manage larger numbers of foot soldiers, which required their commanders to organise <br/>
them by weapon types, so we have the emergence of companies of spears, of archers, of gunners, etc. I <br/>
don't think any daimyo ever raised 'ashigaru cavalry' as a separate arm. <br/>
<br/>
This meant that even among Takeda units, who were usually better organised and managed than their <br/>
enemies, and who seemingly favoured mounted troops, there would have been a large percentage of foot <br/>
among the horse, so that even the charges against the Nagashino barricades, as shown in Kagemusha, would <br/>
have in reality comprised of a mixed force of horse and foot, the footmen 'chasing' their mounted masters <br/>
into battle, rather than pure cavalry in a samurai 'Charge of the Light Brigade'.<br/>
<br/>
Another factor is weaponry. Initially a horseback archer, the later, Sengoku mounted warrior was a spearmen <br/>
(I still don't understand why, in many translations, spearmen on foot are armed with 'lances' and spearmen <br/>
on horseback with 'spears'!), but significantly handled his weapon unlike his European counterpart. The spear <br/>
was wielded to left and right, not forward, and was never used in the couch position like a lancer. Therefore <br/>
the samurai never evolved cavalry in ordered, shoulder-to-shoulder charges, nor did they develop, as far as I <br/>
know, separate all-mounted units for use in pursuit, as heavy and light cavalry evolved in Europe.<br/>
<br/>
My feeling is the pre-eminence of the Takeda cavalry, so often quoted, has more to do with Takeda morale as <br/>
a whole than any significant tactical advantage. The defeat at Nagashino of a well-led, well-armed and highly <br/>
motivated 'samurai' army by a rabble of 'peasants' armed with guns must have struck a blow against the <br/>
samurai psyche from which it never fully recovered.    <br/>
<br/>
Lastly, I think a key is in the word 'evolution'. European history has evolved many types of mounted warrior - <br/>
hussar, dragoon, lancer, etc., and tactics for their useage accordingly, which came about as different <br/>
countries developed their own systems, and then fought each other, so influencing their neighbours. The first <br/>
Hussars, I think, were Hungarian light cavalry, which their enemies copied as 'a good idea'. Napoleon raised <br/>
regiments of lancers after some unpleasant experiences fighting the Poles on his way to Russia, and the Brits <br/>
copied them off him. I don't think the US cavalry ever used lancers? We (the Brits) did right up until WW1. <br/>
The Poles still used them in WW2. The samurai 'suffered' in that they never had this process of cross-<br/>
fertilisation to introduce new concepts and ideas.<br/>
<br/>
Just some thoughts.<br/>

Mounted people use lances, too. That's why the British cavalry has "Lancers."<br/>
<br/>
When I wrote my books, I made a point of calling them all lances despite people's use of "spear" because a lance<br/>
you poke people with and a spear you toss.<br/>

I'm also one of the few people who still makes a distinction between "dagger" and "dirk"<br/>

No, I'm not nor ever was in the military, whatever arm, I just couldn't resist the dig ;-)<br/>
<br/>
As an off-topic aside, but in the spirit of this thread, I'm not sure if European heavy cavalry was armed with <br/>
swords, whereas the light were armed with sabres, but I could be wrong there.<br/>
<br/>
Either way, in the Charge of the Heavy Brigade at Balaclava (Crimean War, a fantastic cavalry victory <br/>
overshadowed by the Light's disaster) the Russian greatcoat turned the points of their swords! Oh for a well-<br/>
made tachi then!<br/>
<br/>
Nate - do you know why (and am I right in thinking) that the US never took up the lance? It seems to have <br/>
remained a frighteningly effective weapon in Europe right up to the mechanised era.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Hey, that's what the Cav is for...taking the glory<br/>
while those poor grunts get the heck pounded out of<br/>
them! <br/>
<br/>
As far as why the U.S. Cavalry never took up the<br/>
lance, I'm not entirely sure. I would never claim to<br/>
be an expert on cavalry history, though I am trying to<br/>
learn as much as possible (I'm reading a great book<br/>
right now, The Horse in Warfare...pretty good). I do<br/>
know that U.S. Cav historically has fought more as<br/>
dragoons than as anything else...probably because in<br/>
the Revolutionary War that was the easiest<br/>
organization for a militia to maintain, and warfare on<br/>
the North American continent has never really been<br/>
conducive to the grand cavalry battles as in Europe.<br/>
By the time the U.S. embroiled itself in conflicts<br/>
(The Mexican War, U.S. Civil War) firepower had caught<br/>
up with mobility and charges into the guns were not<br/>
advisable for cavalry or infantry. Mostof the U.S.<br/>
Army's 19th century combat (except for 1812-14,<br/>
1846-48, 1861-65, and 1898) consisted of Indian<br/>
(Native American) fighting. The Native American didn't<br/>
form orderly battle lines and march onto the field<br/>
like Napoleon's Grande Armee. Indians were hit-and-run<br/>
mounted archers, and to combat them the U.S. Cavalry<br/>
evolved into mounted riflemen and scouts. In the U.S.<br/>
Army today, cavalry is synonomous with scouts and<br/>
reconnaisance. Cavalry has always been more important<br/>
in the U.S. as a reconaissance force than as a<br/>
striking force (witness JEB Stuart's failure at<br/>
Gettysburg), Americans preferring to hit the enemy<br/>
with artillery than to charge in among them. Maybe<br/>
that's why we never developed "Lancer" units, but I<br/>
think it's because the U.S. Cavalry developed<br/>
primarily as an Indian fighting force. If we had a<br/>
unit of "Lancers" charge and Indian position, they'd<br/>
just run...with as much land as we had in the 19th<br/>
century, the Indians could just keep running and<br/>
running...<br/>
<br/>
I hope this might help, though again I do not claim to<br/>
be an expert. Ask me about the M1A1 Tank or what a<br/>
modern Division Cavalry Squadron does, and I'll tell<br/>
you!<br/>
<br/>
Scouts Out!<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-4041582">At least in the 18th century, European cuirassiers and most dragoons were<br/>
armed with the "pallasch" or straight sword.  Hussars used the saber.  The<br/>
point of the straight sword was used most often, while the saber was<br/>
probably used more for slashing.  Obviously, we are drifting far from Japan.<br/>
