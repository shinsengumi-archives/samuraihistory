Is that *all*?<br/>
<br/>
Do you realize how many libraries are taken to encompass even a part of this?<br/>

  A couple of very useful websites are: www.samurai-archives.com and <br/>
www.sho-shin.com.  They both require some poking around to find out <br/>
information.  I've been researching something for myself about the <br/>
samurai, and these two sites have been of GREAT help.  Plus, they may <br/>
lead you to others which will be of even more help, and have <br/>
recommendations for reading, which will help get the rest of the <br/>
information.<br/>
