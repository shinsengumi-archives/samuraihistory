TOKYO - The climax of the new film "The Last Samurai" is no<br/>
ordinary fight scene: It is a coda to Japan's medieval past<br/>
and a nod to its enduring fighting spirit. <br/>
<br/>
After a dramatic battle, the leader of a group of rebel<br/>
holdouts commits ritual suicide rather than surrender in<br/>
shame to the well-armed and newly Westernized Japanese<br/>
Army. The victors, awed by the rebels' bravery, bow in<br/>
reverence. Though they now wear Prussian-style uniforms,<br/>
they remain true to the samurais' unspoken code of Bushido.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
The film takes place in the late 1870's, when Japan was<br/>
abandoning its feudal society and industrializing, yet the<br/>
same tug of war between preserving tradition and opening<br/>
Japan to the world persists today. Even as Japan is about<br/>
to commit troops in Iraq, sending its military abroad for<br/>
the first time since World War II, the tension between old<br/>
ways and modern life is evident. <br/>
<br/>
The movie, though fictional, reminds us that while the<br/>
samurai are gone, many of their values are still part of<br/>
the fabric of Japanese society. Though outsiders - and many<br/>
Japanese - exaggerate the resonance of this mix of<br/>
allegiance, self-control and shame, the social structure<br/>
that nurtures these values has resisted everything from the<br/>
American occupation to encroaching globalization. <br/>
<br/>
"Hierarchy is still part of everyday life in Japan," said<br/>
Sheldon M. Garon, a professor of history at Princeton<br/>
University and author of "Molding Japanese Minds"<br/>
(Princeton University Press, 1997). "It's in every<br/>
relationship, whether it's a company, college or otherwise.<br/>
The basic organizational structure is remarkably<br/>
resilient." <br/>
<br/>
American society may celebrate initiative and reward<br/>
upstarts, but most Japanese still define themselves by<br/>
their affiliations and their ranking in these groups. The<br/>
samurai did not invent the system; they were just ardent<br/>
followers of it. But their fervor has become lore in Japan,<br/>
where "salarymen" are compared to warriors, baseball teams<br/>
are like armies and students cramming for exams wear<br/>
headbands like kamikaze pilots. <br/>
<br/>
The flip side is the shame in letting down one's boss,<br/>
coach or teacher. "The Japanese ethical code consists of<br/>
three main pillars: obligation, shame and the environment<br/>
that surrounds people," said Shinichi Yanaka, a professor<br/>
at Japan Women's University and a specialist in Bushido,<br/>
the samurai's code. "To do something bad in Japan does not<br/>
only mean breaking the rules but also doing something that<br/>
society does not permit." <br/>
<br/>
This system of social checks and balances was heavily<br/>
refined during the shoguns' rule from 1600 to 1868. The<br/>
circles people moved in and the roles they performed were<br/>
far more rigidly defined than today, and the penalties for<br/>
failure were often crueler, including banishment and death<br/>
by sword. <br/>
<br/>
The arrival of the Americans and the industrialization they<br/>
ushered in threatened the system and the ruling class that<br/>
long benefited from it. Within two decades - the time frame<br/>
for "The Last Samurai" - Japan's industrialists and their<br/>
Western backers all but replaced that status quo. <br/>
<br/>
But the samurai spirit and the precepts of Bushido made a<br/>
comeback in the 1930's as Japan's military prepared the<br/>
nation for war. The kamikaze pilots, who defended the honor<br/>
of Japan and the emperor by turning their airplanes into<br/>
missiles, were the most fanatical expression of this<br/>
thinking. <br/>
<br/>
The sentimental attachment to the samurai code runs deep.<br/>
Japanese form hundreds of relationships based on deep and<br/>
often subtle obligations to one's company, school or sports<br/>
teams. And with those obligations comes the shame in not<br/>
meeting them. <br/>
<br/>
After World War II, workers began to see themselves as<br/>
toiling not for money but for the honor of serving their<br/>
corporate masters, and helped turn Japan into an economic<br/>
giant. During the economy's 10-year slide, though,<br/>
thousands of businessmen have killed themselves for letting<br/>
down co-workers, companies and families. <br/>
<br/>
"After the war, people thought their companies were their<br/>
family and decided to be loyal to the company," said Eiichi<br/>
Motono, a professor at Waseda University who studies<br/>
Japan's industrial development. "People who did not work<br/>
for companies were considered heretics, and those who<br/>
failed to keep up with their business were looked down on.<br/>
That is why people commit suicide in today's stagnant<br/>
economy." <br/>
<br/>
Increasingly, Japanese are questioning their romance with<br/>
the samurai past, even as many others cling to the old ways<br/>
and lament the decline in the lifetime employment system<br/>
and other cornerstones of postwar Japan. <br/>
<br/>
One thing is certain, though: No matter how strong the<br/>
pressure for cultural change, the intertwining code of<br/>
obligation and shame that has grown over centuries will not<br/>
unravel easily. <br/>
