 </span></blockquote>Maybe this is a misunderstanding, usually when I hear referendum I <br/>
assume that citizens are voting on the subject and it's not the monarchy <br/>
negotiating with foreign powers.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Yep, it was a coup that the US backed.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>This is so true, we are also not the Americans of the period as well. <br/>
Japanese tenant farmers were still little better than slaves. Their <br/>
lifestyle had not changed since the Tokugawa bakafu decided to squeeze <br/>
them. In many ways all but the urban elite and the military were still <br/>
fairly bad off. In many ways it was a continuation of the fuedal state <br/>
with technology thrown in. It's the ugly ending of the military classes <br/>
as rulers of Japan.<br/>
