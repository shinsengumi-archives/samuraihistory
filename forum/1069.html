<div id="ygrps-yiv-221322717">I do not claim to be an expert on the subject.  However,  From what I <br/>
have read these are the thoughts the I have come up with conderning <br/>
ninja.  Tenshin Shoden Katori Shinto Ryu , the oldest documented <br/>
martial art in Japan dating from the 1400's, includes ninjutsu <br/>
training in it ciriculum.  It is about 600 years old, while the <br/>
Bujinkan claims to have a lineage dating back over 800 years.  I <br/>
think that the original ninja were actually samurai.  Smaurai that <br/>
specialized in the ninjutsu techniques of one of the ryu they <br/>
studied.  Yagyu Jubei is an example.  He was a samurai, but is well <br/>
known for acting as a ninja.  Of course this is just one example.  <br/>
Durring the Tokugawa period there were a large number of ronin in <br/>
Japan.  The idea of the freelance ninja probably developed from this <br/>
time.  Ronin who had been trained in nijutsu techniques would sell <br/>
their services, and teach others.  This is when ,I think, ninjutsu as <br/>
a seperate clandestine art developed.  This is also when history and <br/>
myths got mixed together and gave the idea that ninja had a long <br/>
history.  Or maybe the instrustors at that time told their students <br/>
that there was a long history.  And those histories have been taught <br/>
to modern students.  Now before I get too many indictments <br/>
for "ninjutsu bashing"  let me say this.   I am not saying ninjutsu <br/>
is a good or bad art to train in.  I studied ninjutsu myself before I <br/>
developed my interest in the samurai.  I am only speaking of history <br/>
here.  For more information this is a good article <br/>

Dr. Karl Friday holds a Menkyo Kaiden (highest rank possible) in <br/>
Kashima Shin Ryu, one of the oldest documented ryu.  He is also a <br/>
trained historian and is professor in University of Georgia's history <br/>
department.  Once again I don't claim to be an expert on this so I am <br/>
very open to others opinions and inforamtion.  Just try to remain <br/>
academic and don't get too personal *lol*.</div>
