<div id="ygrps-yiv-1961329111">Thanks guys.You helped me very much.I just had a history test.It was easy cuz I like very much history.The last subject was "Which person impressed you the most".I said about TAKEDA SHINGEN.I wrote about some things you told me.I think I put my history teacher it a big difficulty.She was lucky because I didn't say about some things like the Kawanakajima battles against Uesugi.Thanx very much.<br/>
