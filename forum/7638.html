 <br/>
<br/>
An Oak Street Cinema Samurai Cinema Retrospective will present six <br/>
of sword wielding action epics genre's greatest films in a series <br/>
spanning Sept 2-22 at the theater located at 309 Oak Street, <br/>
Minneapolis (just a half block off Washington Avenue SE on the U of <br/>
M East Bank campus). <br/>
<br/>
The films include: "Samurai Rebellion" and "Harakiri" from director <br/>
Masaki Kobayashi; "The Hidden Fortress" and "Seven Samurai" from <br/>
director Akira Kurosawa; and "Sword of Doom" and "Kill!" from <br/>
director Kihachi Okamoto.<br/>
<br/>
The series begins with a new 35mm print of Samurai Rebellion on <br/>
Friday, September 2 through Sept. 5 at 7:20, 9:40 nightly; Saturday <br/>
at 2:30 and 5:00. Samurai Rebellion was made in 1967 and was <br/>
directed by Masaki Kobayashi. It stars Toshiro Mifune, Yoko Tsukasa, <br/>
and Tatsuya Nakadai. Mifune, a legend in Japan cinema, stars as <br/>
Isaburo, an aging swordsman living a quiet life. When his lord <br/>
begins making unreasonable demands, however, Isaburo has enough and <br/>
the peaceful family man takes a stand against injustice.<br/>
<br/>
The second film in the series is Hidden Fortress, which will screen <br/>
on Wednesday, Sept 7 and Sept. 8 at 7:00, 9:40 nightly. Director <br/>
Akira Kurosawa's 1958 film stars Toshiro Mifune and Minoru Chiaki as <br/>
a general and a princess that must dodge enemy clans while smuggling <br/>
the royal treasure out of hostile territory with two bumbling, <br/>
conniving peasants at their sides. The film inspired Star Wars.<br/>
<br/>
The series continues with a new 35mm print of Harakiri from Friday, <br/>
Sept 9 through Monday, Sept 12, at 7:00, 9:40 nightly; and Saturday <br/>
at 1:30, 4:15. Harakiri was produced in 1962 by director Masaki <br/>
Kobayashi and stars Tatsuya Nakadai and Rentaro Mikuni. Following <br/>
the collapse of his clan, unemployed samurai Hanshiro Tsugumo <br/>
(Nakadai) arrives at the manor of Lord Iyi, begging to commit ritual <br/>
suicide on his property. Iyi's clansmen, believing the desperate <br/>
ronin is merely angling for charity, try to force him to eviscerate <br/>
himselfÂ—but they have underestimated his honor and his past. Winner <br/>
of the 1963 Cannes Special Jury Prize, the films portrays feudal <br/>
authority and hypocrisy.<br/>
<br/>
A new 35mm print of Sword of Doom follows on Thursday, Sept 15 <br/>
through Sept 17, at 7:20, 9:40 nightly; and Saturday at 2:30, 5:00. <br/>
The film was produced in 1966 by director Kihachi Okamoto and stars <br/>
Tatsuya Nakadai and Toshiro Mifune in the story of a wandering <br/>
samurai who finds violence at every turn. Full of carnage and not <br/>
for the faint of heart, the film traces the slow disintegration of <br/>
aristocratic, savage loner Ryunosuke (Nakadai), whose murderous <br/>
determination bypasses any sense of mercy or remorse. This samurai <br/>
classic is a jaw-dropping exploration of good and evil.<br/>
<br/>
The series continues on Sunday, Sept 18 and Monday, Sept 19 with a <br/>
new 35mm print of "Kill!" at 7:20, 9:40 nightly. The film was <br/>
produced in 1968 by director Kihachi Okamoto and stars Tatsuya <br/>
Nakadai and Etsushi Takahashi. This dark-humored action film follows <br/>
the story of a pair of down-on-their-luck swordsmen arrive in a <br/>
windblown town and become involved in a local clan dispute. One <br/>
longs to become a noble samurai while the other prefers living <br/>
anonymously with gangsters. But when they discover the wrongdoings <br/>
of the nefarious leader, they side with a band of rebels who are <br/>
under siege at a remote mountain cabin. Though true to samurai <br/>
convention, Okamoto's film technique borrows from chanbara classics <br/>
and has a bit of Spaghetti Western feel.<br/>
<br/>
Long considered the epic masterpiece of samurai film, director Akira <br/>
Kurosawa's "Seven Samurai" will be screened on Sept 21 and Sept 22 <br/>
at 7:30 nightly. The 1954 film stars Toshiro Mifune and Takashi <br/>
Shimura in a film that seamlessly weaves philosophy and <br/>
entertainment, delicate human emotions and relentless action. Seven <br/>
Samurai became the foundation for action films from the Spaghetti <br/>
Western to the urban shoot-em-ups of the 1980s. <br/>
