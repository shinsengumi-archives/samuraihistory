<h3>Use of banners</h3>
by <i>napenadk</i>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1960318883">Hi, I'm new to the group and I hope someone can help me. I'm a <br/>
figurepainter and I have just started my first set of Samurais. I'm not <br/>
sure about the banners they are wearing on the back. You can see the <br/>
set I'm painting here: <br/>

In the boxart on front af the box, they seem all different, but on the <br/>
back of the box (not vissible on the website) there are a picture of <br/>
some painted figures, here they are all the same ? It says in the text <br/>
on the website, that the banner tell what army they belong to.<br/>
Could anyone tell what is the right thing, then I would be very happy.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>It all depends on what sort of relationship you want to portray. If  <br/>
you want to portray your figures as belonging to the same group, then  <br/>
paint the sashimono banners (the banners on poles behind their back)  <br/>
and the little banners on the back of their helmets more or less the  <br/>
same. The sashimono banners should probably have kamon on them. The  <br/>
little helmet banners probably should not.<br/>
