since the Tokugowa Shogunate lasted from 1606 until 1870's give or <br/>
take.<br/>

their differences and Ieyasu allowed himself to become a vassal.<br/>

  Arguable. After all, Ieyasu defeated Mitsunari and destroyed Hideyoshi's <br/>
line. I'd say in the end he won.  ;)<br/>

 </span></blockquote>MJ<br/>
<br/>
I had the same thought--however, with this line we're<br/>
getting out of the parameters of the question, as I<br/>
understand it. It asked specifically about a<br/>
BATTLE--not a war, or political struggle, between<br/>
Hideyoshi and Ieyasu, not between Ieyasu and<br/>
Hideyoshi's house, line, progeny, what have you.<br/>
<br/>
Therefore, my answer would be this:<br/>
<br/>
Hideyoshi and Ieyasu squared off against each other in<br/>
what was called the Komaki Campaign. Ostensibly,<br/>
Ieyasu was supporting Oda Nobuo against Hideyoshi, but<br/>
the contest was really between the two of them. Both<br/>
sides fortified some castles in the Owari-Mino area,<br/>
along the Tokaido. Neither side moved, and neither<br/>
could gain a tactical advantage, until forces of<br/>
Hideyoshi's led by Ikeda Shonyu attempted a flanking<br/>
attack on the Tokugawa position. Ieyasu had<br/>
anticipated the move, and a during a running battle<br/>
called the Battle of Nagakute, Tokugawa forces<br/>
defeated Hideyoshi's force. Each side learned about<br/>
the other--Hideyoshi learned that any attempt to move<br/>
against Ieyasu would be difficult at best, and he'd<br/>
lost a lot of time and men doing it. Ieyasu learned<br/>
that he could hold off Hideyoshi for a long time, but<br/>
if push came to shove he'd eventually lose. So the<br/>
campaign was essentially a draw. Tactical victory for<br/>
Ieyasu, strategic victory for Hideyoshi.<br/>
<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Not arguable at all. The question wasn't on the Tokugawa vs. the Toyotomi: it <br/>
was Ieyasu vs. Hideyoshi. Hideyoshi was long dead before Sekigahara.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>No one's saying that "Kamo" isn't a last name--just<br/>
questioning whether the name is the same characters<br/>
used as "duck", which is doubtful, at least in my<br/>
mind. <br/>
<br/>
"Kamo" is a name, both of places and people--no<br/>
argument. However, to romanize it properly, it should<br/>
be "Kamou", since it's a long/double O sound. Fear<br/>
not, no one is saying it's not a name. <br/>

<br/>
Here's what I found:<br/>
Firt, your mom's family couldn't be samurai. That class was abolished in the late 19th century by the Meiji government. They could be descended from samurai (which is not the same thing).<br/>
Secondly, there are no Japanese castles that are privately owned. They all belong to the goverment (usually the prefectural or city govenment where they are located). The last privately owned castle (Inuyama) gave up the ghost a couple of years ago and turned it over to the city.<br/>
Anyway, Kamo (or Kamou) is indeed a Japanese name, but not one that has any notations in the couple of sources I checked (including Sengoku Chronik, which has histories for about 200 families and their retainers).<br/>
On the castle front, none of the castles that existed in the Edo period were ever under the control/stewardship of a Kamo family. This takes it back to about the year 1600. I also checked the histories of the handful of extant Japanese castles that were around before 1600, and none of them were ever associated with a Kamo.<br/>
Is it possible (as LT has already alluded to) that the family name might have been pronounced Gamou? That's close to Kamou, and there is a very famous castle (Aizu-Wakamatsu) that was controlled by the Gamou for a few years.<br/>
Anyway, if you could post the kanji used for your mother's family name (or better yet, the name of the castle-the ones left have well documented histories) it would be helpful in finding out more. </span></blockquote></div>
