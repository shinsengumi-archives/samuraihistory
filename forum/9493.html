<br/>
  Sorry but it is a basic IY query and is really nitpicking so if ya <br/>
  ain't a diehard anime and/or IY fanatic, take no mind. For the rest <br/>
  of us- We now have two distinct dates. 1545 and 1615. Remember <br/>
  jakotsu's encounter with the matchlock wielding riflemen? There were <br/>
  no flintlocks in Japan before the Portugese came in 1545. In 1615 the <br/>
  Tokogowan victor's (NobuNaga) first act (after using rifles to win <br/>
  the Great Battle which united the clans in 1615) was to ban and <br/>
  outlaw 'all' firearms. Therefore it is twixt 1545 and 1615 that IY is <br/>
  laid. Another one for you- why are IY and his bro considered 'Lords'? <br/>
  More later. Toodles-K&K<br/>
