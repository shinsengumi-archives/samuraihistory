<div id="ygrps-yiv-1181924059">Is the author's name by chance acrtulayy  SHIGEO SUGAWA????    If so, then I<br/>
have it.  It is well worth having for anyone interested in<br/>
teppo/tanegashima/hinawaju as it is in English.  Many excellent colour<br/>
photos and a very interesting section on accoutrements.<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
PS: I have just received from a friend a copy of a Japanese book on<br/>
firearms.  Very comprehensive, some remarkable photos, many gunsmith mei.<br/>
Anyone interested in the details please mail me off line.  I've been trying<br/>
to compile a list of my (small) firearm references for those interested so<br/>
anyone interested in that please also email me off line.<br/>
