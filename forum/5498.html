The Yasukuni Swords<br/>
By Tom Kishida (Translated by Kenji Mishina)<br/>
<br/>
The 8,100 swords manufactured in the grounds of the Yasukuni Shrine <br/>
between 1933 and 1945 are an exceptional legacy, as artifacts that <br/>
preserved not only time-honored forging methods but the aesthetic <br/>
and spiritual traditions of the samurai warrior.<br/>
<br/>
No other weapon in the world can boast of possessing such a high <br/>
spiritual quality as the Japanese sword. For over a thousand years <br/>
the sword was revered as the very soul of the samurai warriors who <br/>
wielded it, commanding awe, respect, and an almost religious <br/>
devotion.<br/>
<br/>
The tumultuous events of modern Japanese history and the nation's <br/>
relentless drive toward technological advancement, however, <br/>
irrevocably sealed the sword's fate, and, along with the samurai <br/>
class, the sword became an anachronism, both culturally and <br/>
militarily.<br/>
<br/>
As Japan entered a period of unprecedented Imperial expansion in the <br/>
early twentieth century, the Japanese sword, despite its limited <br/>
practical effect, became a feature of the soldier's arsenal  an <br/>
echo of the mythical status it enjoyed in feudal times. The Yasukuni <br/>
swords emerged during the build-up to World War II, in part to help <br/>
meet the huge demands of the Imperial Army, but more importantly out <br/>
of a desire to preserve time-honored forging methods, and to revive <br/>
the spirit of the samurai. For these reasons, they were notably <br/>
distinct from so-called "Showa-to," which were mass-produced and <br/>
inferior in quality and artistry.<br/>
<br/>
All swords were banned in the immediate aftermath of World War II, <br/>
and the decades that followed have seen a decline in the popularity <br/>
of Yasukuni swords, largely because of their associations with that <br/>
war and the military. Another factor has been the stigma attached to <br/>
Showa-to, which has helped to stereotype wartime swords in general.<br/>
<br/>
Recent years, however, have seen a renewed interest in the surviving <br/>
Yasukuni swords. Many collectors and appraisers have acknowledged <br/>
the workmanship of these swords as displaying a perfect blend of <br/>
technology and tradition, and a quality that can rival even that of <br/>
the great classical smiths.<br/>
<br/>
In his tribute to the Yasukuni smiths, acclaimed photographer and <br/>
sword enthusiast Tom Kishida has compiled an extensive study of <br/>
these rare and exceptional swords, drawing on a variety of sources <br/>
to shed light on this often little-understood chapter of Japanese <br/>
sword history.<br/>
<br/>
With his unique eye for capturing the beauty of the blades in his <br/>
photographs, he has provided the reader with the most lavishly <br/>
detailed book on Yasukuni swords to date. This will be an important <br/>
addition to the libraries of specialists and connoisseurs, and to <br/>
those who wish to deepen their understanding of these fascinating <br/>
wartime weapons.<br/>
