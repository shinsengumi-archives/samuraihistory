<div id="ygrps-yiv-1869425831">Many like to claim that a ninja hired by Oda Nobunaga crawled up kenshins toilet (with a spear), stuck it up his rear, and then returned to collect his pay.  This is a load of...... well, you know.  He had stomach cancer from drinking alot of sake his whole life, and this is what killed him.  Many would disagree, but it seems to me that it would be very convenient for a shinobi to claim such a feat to collect his pay.  I would be happy to hear any other input on this though....<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-228653973">Well, the true story, according to a 100 year old samurai used to be I met in Japantown in San Francisco as  he was trying to sell me a secret treasure map what would lead me to where Kenshin was buried, is that he was struck in the behind by someone who had the courage to crawl through all that crap to spear an unknown backside in the loo. Can you imagine, what if someone else was taking a dump, the plot would have been discovered and Nobunaga would not have the empire. Or you can just use your own imagination as to how he died. It could have been from stomach cancer or maybe he drank himself into a stupor in the loo and died from alcoholic poisoning. And furthermore, ask this question, how the heck would the ninja known what Kenshin's backside looked like? Your choice.<br/>

to have hid in the lavatory, more like a latrine for three days <br/>
waiting for his target to come to that particular one, when the <br/>
target did indeed arrive he was stabbed from below [yes the ninja was <br/>
stood in the actual sewer stream] and killed.<br/>
<br/>
This story blossomed from the rumours that the Oda had him <br/>
assassinated. This was mainly due to the timely death which benefited <br/>
the Oda enormously.<br/>
<br/>
However, many Japanese scholars believe he contracted a severe <br/>
illness, stomach cancer is mentioned, and thereby died.<br/>
<br/>
The legend of the assassination is a little more colourful but a lot <br/>
less likely - but who knows</div>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-97724113">Hi every one,<br/>
   <br/>
    Regarding the cause of the death of Kenshin, they are thought many reasons.<br/>
    Like by disease , assasinaiton by ninja, etc.<br/>
   <br/>
    Much more than that , Kenshin is so famous for  his good humanity. <br/>
    For example, Kenshin sent salt to his formidable enemy, rival , who was  Shingen Takeda  as gifit  to help .   Shingen was lacking in salt always due to the reason of the circumstance arround him.   Kenshin tried to help even his long time enemy.<br/>
  It was attributed by his thought that he believed Justice was very important   To help enemy when enemy has problem is Kenshin's motto.  Kensin was a man of man in that sense.<br/>
