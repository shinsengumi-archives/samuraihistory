I believe that is a point of debate that continues here to this day. <br/>
And I think it is the 'samura sourcebook' you are probably referring <br/>
to.</div>

 </span></blockquote>The Samurai Sourcebook is pretty good. And most of his<br/>
books, individually, are good. The biggest problem<br/>
I've seen is that most of the books are extremely<br/>
repetitive. The same anecdotes, the same outline, etc.<br/>
While some of this can be excused by "updating"--his<br/>
first books were published in the 1970's, so it'<br/>
understandable things will change somewhat--it's<br/>
almost like if you own one Turnbull book, you own them<br/>
all. The fact that he keeps publishing more and more<br/>
(Especially 'Samurai Warriors', 'Samurai Warlords',<br/>
etc.,) seems like he's just reshuffling and adding a<br/>
new title to make more money. The second complaint I<br/>
often see is "inaccuracies"--some of his earlier<br/>
stuff, especially, is, well, wrong on many points. He<br/>
does seem to correct that in later works, at least. <br/>
<br/>
All that being said, he's great because with all his<br/>
faults, he gets information out there. He's much<br/>
easier to read than John Whitney Hall, etc. I just<br/>
bought 2 more books by him, and I'll let you know what<br/>
I think when I get them from Amazon. <br/>
