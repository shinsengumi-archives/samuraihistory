<br/>
What is prompt for you to come to interested in samurai?<br/>
<br/>
I am very interested in samurai because since my childhood I have <br/>
seen samurai movie,which my father liked.And I live in Japan,so I <br/>
could often see samurai on TV. I took it for granted.But I wonder if <br/>
I lived out of Japan,how I think of samurai?<br/>
<br/>
So I want to know how sumurai is reported out of Japan.And why <br/>
samurai fascinate many people?I will get some hints of it if I could <br/>
know your reason why you interested in samurai.<br/>
<br/>
Thank you for your reading.</div>
