<div id="ygrps-yiv-849623518">OH MAN!!! The archive is something else because a few days ago I wanted to find out what the knot on top of the Katana was called. It was cool knowing they saved all those messages and post I am also thankfull. I found that in which I was in shearch of Thannks editor and you guys that work to make this the best Yahoo goup on the planet. Even though no one has come up with the controversial "greatest samurai" or "who would win between ninja and samurai" questions in a while there are a lot of great post going in and out. So happy holidays to all and GOD BLESS YOU<br/>

Peace<br/>
