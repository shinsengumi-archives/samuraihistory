 </span></blockquote>Well, you found us, so that's a start. <br/>
<br/>
Normally I just give the website<br/>
(www.samurai-archives.com) and tell people to go to<br/>
the recommended reading, and I'll tell you that too.<br/>
But a good base place to start would be two authors:<br/>
our own Anthony J. Bryant (or Tony, to those of us who<br/>
have been abused by him here) has written several<br/>
books--just type his name into Amazon and that should<br/>
get you started; also, I'll go ahead and recommend<br/>
Stephen Turnbull--you'll hear both good and bad about<br/>
his books. The good is that there are certainly a lot<br/>
of them, and they are fairly easy to read and cover<br/>
the topics most people want to read about. The bad is<br/>
that many of his books are repetitive, and sometimes,<br/>
especially in his older books, he's not completely<br/>
right about things (he mostly corrects them in later<br/>
books, as far as I can tell). <br/>
<br/>
Those are probably the easiest places to get<br/>
started--after that, just work your way down the<br/>
recommended reading list, and keep following the<br/>
threads here--new books usually get mentioned and<br/>
discussed. <br/>

 </span></blockquote>In 1594 the Shimazu retainer Konnani Makeruzo was<br/>
involved in a drunken brawl with a shop keeper, Koreha<br/>
Joudan. Joudan subdued the drunken samurai with an arm<br/>
lock, and then proceeded to deliver the coup de grace<br/>
by pinching Makeruzo's nose between his first two<br/>
fingers and making a "honk" sound. Konnani was<br/>
considered to have been "beated up" enough that he<br/>
withdrew from public life (after much mocking) and<br/>
became a monk, taking the name Dameningen. Joudan went<br/>
on to leave Japan and make a living having young<br/>
westerners perform slave labor, under the guise of<br/>
teaching them ancient arts of self defense, <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
And if you believe this, I've got an authentic<br/>
straight ninja sword for sale, too.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Well, one just got his butt kicked on "Mito Komon" by<br/>
a commoner, but that's fiction. Reality, of course, is<br/>
that a samurai couldn't ever be beaten by a commoner.<br/>
It takes a ninja, 3rd skill level, to beat a samurai.<br/>
Unless you've got the "invincible armor" power up, in<br/>
which case the townsperson could win, but only if he<br/>
had the secret "throwing star" attack also.<br/>
<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Thank you, I try. If we can't laugh at ourselves....at<br/>
least we can get a cheap laugh at another's expense. <br/>
<br/>
To be somewhat serious about this, I'm sure if you<br/>
looked through "police files" or whatever records the<br/>
local magistrates kept, there would be plenty of<br/>
instances where commoners beat up on samurai, and vice<br/>
versa. It'd be fairly interesting to see if they<br/>
machi-bugyo handled the cases any differently. Where<br/>
you'd find any of this in Engish, I have no idea. <br/>

 </span></blockquote>Okay, so I made time, even though, as stated, it was a<br/>
HYPOTHETICAL--I'm not the one who brought this up in<br/>
the first place.<br/>
<br/>
Out of 64 hits I got on the Google english website, 1<br/>
showed some promise. However, it was a link to<br/>
Japanese resources, of course:<br/>
<br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://dra.library.ubc.ca/MARION/auth?fmt_limit=&lng_limit=&index=T&key=Ky%E5oto+Gaikokugo+Daigaku+kenky%E5u+rons%E5o.&limits=">http://dra.library.ubc.ca/MARION/auth?fmt_limit=&lng_limit=&index=T&key=Ky%E5oto+Gaikokugo+Daigaku+kenky%E5u+rons%E5o.&limits=</a><br/>
<br/>
On the middle of the page are some "machi bugyo<br/>
nikki", diaries of machi bugyo. Could be very<br/>
interesting, and there is a chance that it may refer<br/>
to cases of samurai vs. chonin. <br/>
<br/>
Every other hit was either a short definition of a<br/>
machi-bugyo, something that just had the words "machi"<br/>
and "bugyo", or a broken link. <br/>
<br/>
As I said before, not much would be available in<br/>
English as to the specifics of what the person was<br/>
asking for--namely, townsperson vs. samurai fights and<br/>
their outcome/fallout. Of course, he/she can obviously<br/>
refine the search, or use the Japanese google, or go<br/>
to a library. If I were the one looking for the<br/>
information, I'd start on Japanese google for hints,<br/>
and then go to the library.<br/>
<br/>

I find his pompous elitism offending, personally.<br/>
<br/>
I admit that the "story" was funny, and I would have laughed heartily under<br/>
different circumstances. Unfortunately, the whole "trying to make fun of the<br/>
ignorant without them realizing they're being fooled" bent really gets me in<br/>
a bad mood. It's tasteless. Sorry, but it is. I know that pop culture brings<br/>
a LOT of irritating questions to this particular list (hey, they even annoy<br/>
me at times), but it's more productive to either answer the question as best<br/>
you can, or just ignore it altogether.<br/>
<br/>
If I had the knowledge, I'd be spending more time trying to educate those<br/>
who seem willing and capable of understanding what really happened in<br/>
history (as far as we know, anyway). Anyone who isn't willing or able, I'd<br/>
simply tune out.<br/>

Okay, so I made time, even though, as stated, it was a<br/>
HYPOTHETICAL--I'm not the one who brought this up in<br/>
the first place.<br/>
<br/>
Out of 64 hits I got on the Google english website, 1<br/>
showed some promise. However, it was a link to<br/>
Japanese resources, of course:<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Pompous elitism??? Huh? You are reading WAY too much<br/>
into this. If I were a renowned professor or<br/>
something, then maybe I could afford to be pompous or<br/>
elitist. I'm not, and I'm neither. Sorry to hear you<br/>
are offended by my lighthearted attempt at levity. It<br/>
was a JOKE. I didn't attack the poor boy. <br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>There was no intent to make fun of someone without<br/>
them knowing--I thought it was fairly obvious that I<br/>
was making fun of the QUESTION, not them, personally.<br/>
If people want to take things personally, so be<br/>
it--they are perfectly free to ignore, get upset,<br/>
whatever my intent is. <br/>
<br/>
but it's more productive to either<br/>

 </span></blockquote>If we can't have a little tongue in cheek fun, the<br/>
that is what is truly sad. However, in response to the<br/>
protest, I'll try to "tone it down". Begin the "no<br/>
smiling" zone...<br/>

 </span></blockquote>As I said, most of it lead to simple definitions of<br/>
the word. The two diaries in question are from the<br/>
1840's, which may or may not be interesting, depending<br/>
on your slant. Not my cup of tea, period wise, but a<br/>
comparison between then and, say, 1610 would be VERY<br/>
interesting, as far as whether or not the rulings<br/>
differed according to time period. <br/>
