<h3>East of India, West of Japan, North of the river Humber</h3>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-10203923">Hi all<br/>
<br/>
I have been browsing the web again and have found a fantasic website <br/>
on the Bushi/Buke, it is called www.eastofindia.com I just had to <br/>
tell you guys, it rocks. It really does.  It is basically a site <br/>
selling minatures of the samurai in 54mm scale, this in itself may be <br/>
interesting to some, but it is the detail and depth that the <br/>
minatures go to that makes it so good.  The armies of Tokugawa Ieyasu <br/>
and the Mori clan are portrayed also Ii Naomasa (1561-1602) Red <br/>
devils (Not manchester united, but a crack cavalry unit wearing red <br/>
armour.  All the figures have correct Monsho and Sashimono <br/>
Backbanners, and sword positions, they even have the 47 ronin.  It is <br/>
however obvious that there is a catch the catch is they are damn <br/>
expensive too much for the likes of me approx 30 Usd each and 60 for <br/>
a cavalry model.  So only for connosiuers really.  But the site is <br/>
worth checking out for it's photo's of the various samurai and <br/>
historical context.  Personally I used to collect minatures but gave <br/>
it up about 12 years ago as to cost and also I was growing out of it, <br/>
seeing this I have been severley tempted to start up this hobby <br/>
again, but with more of a historical sway, I would like to collect a <br/>
full samurai army of the Hosokawa clan, Date, Mogami, I could go on, <br/>
but I won't, so check out the site to see what I am talking about <br/>
hope you lot like it, message me back with comments.  Also I agree <br/>
with the last comments about the royal armouries at Leeds it is <br/>
excellent, I met Ian Bottomly the curator of the oriental gallery and <br/>
saw some behind the scenes armour for a university archaelogy <br/>
project, he is an expert on Japan check out his book samurai arms and <br/>
armour and he changed my view on the Bushi for ever, Turnbull has <br/>
such a rosy view sometimes.  I saw a helmet with rabbit ears the <br/>
bizzarist coolist, thing I have ever seen to do with samurai.  Anyway <br/>
check out that website you won't regret anything but the price.   <br/>
<br/>
All the best Mark</div>

I love it. Take a look at the first graphic on<br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.eastofindia.com/spring2001_1.htm">http://www.eastofindia.com/spring2001_1.htm</a> and then plate J-K in my first<br/>
book ("The Samurai"). I wonder where they get their inspiration... <G><br/>
<br/>
Right down to the poses...<br/>
<br/>
I gotta tell you, though. That level of detail is what I'd expect in a 24mm.<br/>
Not a 54.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1053080259">Hi Tony<br/>
<br/>
Maybe I was a little enthusiastic, not me normally, it must have been <br/>
good. I have never read your book, is that true do they take their <br/>
ideas from your books, thats a pretty cool compliment then, they say <br/>
imitaition is the best compliment.  I still think the detail is good <br/>
I am no expert but I have seen other complanies 25mm and there Bushi <br/>
ranges are to put it kind poor/.  (^_^) (^O^) I do think they are too <br/>
expensive though.  I might have to buy your book sometime to check <br/>
that out.  Maybe you should get them to put a link to your book, they <br/>
have Turnbulls, by the bucket load (what a surprise!). <br/>
<br/>
Anyways cheers for replying <br/>
<br/>
