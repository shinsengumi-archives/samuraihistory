This was my summer of sam - sam as in samurai. Who knows why? What I <br/>
do know is that when I saw Yoji Yamada's "The Twilight Samurai" back <br/>
in May, it lit something in me. The speed, grace and beauty of the <br/>
fighting, the intractability of the men compelled to do it, the <br/>
tenderness of the women who accepted it, the themes of vengeance and <br/>
loyalty (those primeval melodramatic staples) as expressed in the <br/>
spurting blood and lopped limbs; it all seemed suddenly powerful and <br/>
right and satisfying in a way movies hadn't been for some while.<br/>
<br/>
To begin with, the samurai were all fresh, at least to my eyes. The <br/>
imagery of the West, of knights on horseback, of soldiers charging <br/>
up a beach under heavy fire: all old, all stale, hardly impressive <br/>
anymore. But ... here were these guys in bathrobes. They grunted and <br/>
stomped and stared and laughed. They seemed to be having so much <br/>
fun! And to repeat what I believe is the funniest image I have ever <br/>
invented: They swordfought in flip-flops! How cool is that? That <br/>
hair, shaven (the Japanese equated baldness with masculinity, <br/>
nothing wrong with that!), a ponytail nursed, then folded over to <br/>
form a topknot. The swagger, the run, the utter comfort in the <br/>
physical world! God, to carry a sword, eat sushi and sleep with <br/>
women in kimonos! What else is there? And, speaking of mysteries, <br/>
how do they get the swords to stay in the sashes? Aren't swords <br/>
heavy? Wouldn't they droop? Yet these guys run, ride, sit, drink, <br/>
laugh, all with six pounds of double-folded, multi-pounded and <br/>
quenched blades (always with two: a 27-inch katana and a 14-inch <br/>
wakizashi) imperturbably lodged in their sashes. Baby, that's style!<br/>
<br/>
But unlike most movie fans who get a second wind when some obscure <br/>
stimulus sends them flying into the ether for a few months, I had a <br/>
newspaper at my disposal. So I wrote a batch of pieces on my <br/>
fixation. In one I celebrated three great samurai films - Akira <br/>
Kurosawa's "The Seven Samurai," Hiroshi Inagaki's "Samurai" trilogy <br/>
and Kenji Misumi's "The Last Samurai" (never to be confused with <br/>
Edward Zwick's "The Last Samurai"!) Then I discovered the series <br/>
films of the '60s and '70s, the six "Lone Wolf and Cub" and the <br/>
26 "Zatoichi, the Blind Swordsman," and had great fun writing about <br/>
them, too. But the most fun of all was when Beat <br/>
Takeshi's "Zatoichi, the Blind Swordsman" re-created the<br/>
delights of the earlier series.<br/>
<br/>
But ever since then, I have learned more. I have learned so much - <br/>
say, that Tatsuya Nakadai was a better actor than Toshiro Mifune and <br/>
that Kihachi Okamoto at least rivaled Kurosawa at moments and that <br/>
killing a high lord in the snow at Sakurada Gate in Edo in 1860 <br/>
isn't a good career move but it does get you a certain immortality - <br/>
that I can now say proudly, I know nothing. The breadth and depth, <br/>
the differing tonalities, the textures of color, it's all dazzling <br/>
and possibly endless.<br/>
<br/>
But what the samurai pictures, high and low, seem to have in common <br/>
is a sense of the code - absolute loyalty to the clan, no matter the <br/>
cost (though its meaning could be played straight or ironically) - a <br/>
faith in bravery, and the soundest story construction, movie by <br/>
movie, in history. The writers of these movies were workmen, not <br/>
artists, carpenters and drywall guys, not poets and dancers. Thus <br/>
the stories are all rooted in narrative simplicity and the value of <br/>
motive. Even at their most insipid, they grip in a way that American <br/>
movies seem to have forgotten how to do.<br/>
<br/>
Besides the trio of films I recommend, let me mention several others <br/>
that are equally excellent: "Sword of Doom," a look at a psychotic <br/>
swordsman (played by Nakadai); "Harakiri" (which watches a father - <br/>
Nakadai again - gain vengeance on the clan that bluffed his son into <br/>
a horrible death), "Goyokin" (a giant Italian western sort of <br/>
movie); "Samurai Rebellion," (Mifune on the warpath); "The Yagyu <br/>
Conspiracy" (with Sonny Chiba); and the fabulous "Shogun's Shadow" <br/>
(wall-to-wall-to-ceiling-to-back-porch action, with Chiba as the bad <br/>
guy!).<br/>
<br/>
As you can see, I went a little samurai nuts for weeks and weeks. <br/>
Happily, I have not recovered. Hopefully, I never will.<br/>
