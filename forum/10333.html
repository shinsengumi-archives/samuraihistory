<div id="ygrps-yiv-763143386">The main problem with the historical accuracy of the Tom Cruise film was that Hollywood did a typical blurring of timescales for the period following the opening up of Japan; condensing several decades of wars/rebellions into one event.<br/>
<br/>
 For a quick answer to your question try searching for the "Boshin" wars on the net. These were the struggles between various clans and the Shogunate for control of Japan after the Perry era and leading to the Meiji restoration.This also involved modernisation of the state and trying to preserve Japan's independence from the colonial powers- notably Great Britain, France and the U.S.A., who wished to take economic control in the way that was starting in China. <br/>
<br/>
 This modernisation,however, wasn't to everyones taste, especially for many Samurai, hence a series of rebellions including 1877 which is basically the theme of the film. <br/>
<br/>
 As to actual military assistance, the Japanese were understandably cautious about where to get it from. France and Britain were the main source of weapons initially as they were the world's major powers.<br/>
<br/>
 There were French military missions to the army in the '60s whilst the British provided naval training, and many of the ships.The US had no military reputation prior to their civil war, but lots of surplus weapons afterwards! They then did supply, unofficially, some advisors but I haven't got my file handy with fuller details.<br/>
<br/>
 Portugal had once been the only country allowed to trade with Japan but were replaced by the Dutch East Indies Company in about 1642(?), and they eventually supplied limited numbers of flintlock muskets which the Japanese copied and used until the 1860s, but such trade was strictly limited- one ship a year IIRC.  <br/>
<br/>
 Germany did not come onto the scene until after their victory in the Franco-Prussian War (1870-1), as the country did not previously exist as such; they then replaced the French as their reputation had taken a beating.<br/>
<br/>
 As to diplomats, all powers including America had representatives in Japan; indeed I think Japan sent an ambassador to Washington in about 1868?<br/>
<br/>
 A fascinating period and much overlooked, most histories merely saying something on the lines of " Perry opened up Japan, the Emperor was restored to power and Japan became a modern state"!<br/>
<br/>
BTW, it is very doubtful if more than a handful of the Samurai at this time still fought in armour or even on horseback- so ideas about 16th century armies with modern firearms are off the mark.<br/>
<br/>
Hope this helps.<br/>

Thank you very much for your detailed reply to "DuaneS"'s question.  I was intrigued to read your comment:<br/>
-------------------------------------<br/>
...the Dutch East Indies Company in about 1642(?), ... eventually supplied limited numbers of flintlock muskets which the Japanese copied and used until the 1860s<br/>
------------------------------------<br/>
<br/>
I collect Japanese swords and have three Kunitomo matchlock guns ca 1800.  I'm no expert on the matchlock guns of Japan but I have followed up on literature and do keep my eyes somewhat open for news on matchlocks, BUT, I have never seen any reference to flintlock guns being used as you intimate.  Granted the watchword here is "limited numbers", but again I have never seen them referenced.  I am aware of the published image of a double-barreled flintlock pistol in a Japanese book (19th century??), but that is all.<br/>
<br/>
Do you have any references about these flintlock guns, please???<br/>
<br/>
On a side note, I was keenly interested to see in the Tom Cruise film the use of Gatling guns in the final battle.  Here in Melbourne there is a very interesting little museum of Chinese history.  On the wall is a photograph (I presume) from the Boxer Rebellion showing two pig-tailed Chinese ministering to a carriage-mounted Gatling gun.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-408823758">The Wiki entry for the Boshin Wars contains photos of weapons from the Ryozen History Museum which covers the Bakufu and Meiji period. These include various imports such as Sniders,etc;<br/>
<br/>
Also there are "Gewehr" muzzleloading smoothbores introduced in about the 1840s by the Dutch.I'd assume these "advanced" weapons were for the loyalist clans and others still had to make do with matchlocks until they could acquire better stuff from the British, French and so on.<br/>

<br/>
Most han had gunnery instructors, villages were licensed to use firearms to scare off or kill threatening animals, and guns were a necessity in various locations due to intrusions from Russians in the far North and defense of ports in the South.  To put it simply - there were no active wars, so technological advancement of guns in Japan wasn't necessary, but guns weren't thrown away.  The book "Giving Up the Gun" by Perrin is a joke, and has been ridiculed and lambasted in the Western and Japanese scholarship for decades, but his book is still around because non-Japanese history experts still quote it.<br/>

<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-285626745">By " non-Japanese history experts" who are still quoting Noel Perrin, you mean <br/>
"non-experts". Anybody with more than a cursory knowledge of the field knows <br/>
that the Tokugawa at no time "banned" guns any more than they banned other <br/>
weapons, and as Kitsuno said extensive armories were kept all around Japan for <br/>
the purposes of maintaining defense stockpiles. Efforts were made at procuring <br/>
new weapons, but as Japan was without external threat until the 1800's, there <br/>
really wasn't any reason to pursue it with vigor. People who think Japan <br/>
"abandoned" guns need to stop watching Tom Cruise movies. Noel Perrin was a <br/>
literature professor with no knowledge of Japanese or Japanese history, writing <br/>
what he wanted in order to bolster an argument for gun control in the US. <br/>
Japanese historians thought his work was a joke--I mean, they literally thought <br/>
it was an attempt at humor. It shows just how stupid people can be that his work <br/>
has had the unfortunate negative influence it has had in creating this idealized <br/>
yet completely incorrect image of Japan, and personally he should have been shot <br/>
with a replica tanegashima and all copies of his books burned as an affront to <br/>
scholarship. <br/>

Most han had gunnery instructors, villages were licensed to use firearms to <br/>

The book "Giving Up the Gun" by Perrin is a joke, and has been ridiculed and <br/>

still around because non-Japanese history experts still quote it.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-93523156">Let me make one clarification: the "stupidity" I refer to is not directed at any <br/>
one particular poster in this thread, or any reader here. It is the fact that <br/>
people believe what they want to believe, even in the face of facts and over 30 <br/>
years of debunking the myth that samurai "gave up the gun". My comments and <br/>
frustration are directed at Perrin and the fact that criticism in academic <br/>
journals doesn't prevent his book from being read and quoted as if it's a <br/>
credible source. This is directly involved in my personal field of study in <br/>
graduate school, and it is frustrating to no end, hence my getting worked up. <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Again, not directed at anyone who has commented here. <br/>
<br/>
Thanks.<br/>

By " non-Japanese history experts" who are still quoting Noel Perrin, you mean <br/>
"non-experts". Anybody with more than a cursory knowledge of the field knows <br/>
that the Tokugawa at no time "banned" guns any more than they banned other <br/>
weapons, and as Kitsuno said extensive armories were kept all around Japan for <br/>
the purposes of maintaining defense stockpiles. Efforts were made at procuring <br/>
new weapons, but as Japan was without external threat until the 1800's, there <br/>
really wasn't any reason to pursue it with vigor. People who think Japan <br/>
"abandoned" guns need to stop watching Tom Cruise movies. Noel Perrin was a <br/>
literature professor with no knowledge of Japanese or Japanese history, writing <br/>
what he wanted in order to bolster an argument for gun control in the US. <br/>
Japanese historians thought his work was a joke--I mean, they literally thought <br/>
it was an attempt at humor. It shows just how stupid people can be that his work <br/>
<br/>
has had the unfortunate negative influence it has had in creating this idealized <br/>
<br/>
yet completely incorrect image of Japan, and personally he should have been shot <br/>
<br/>
with a replica tanegashima and all copies of his books burned as an affront to <br/>
scholarship. <br/>

There was definitely not any sort of "Bakufu renunciation of firearms".  That's <br/>
a myth that we tackled in a prior podcast in fact:<br/>
