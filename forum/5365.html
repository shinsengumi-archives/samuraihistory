'Memoirs' finds its 'Geisha'<br/>
Saturday, August 21, 2004 Posted: 2:11 AM EDT (0611 GMT) <br/>
<br/>
LOS ANGELES, California (AP) -- After long years of development and <br/>
some tricky Hollywood dealmaking, a movie version of the best-selling <br/>
novel "Memoirs of a Geisha" is headed into production.<br/>
<br/>
The book became a sensation around the world when it was first <br/>
published in 1997. The story chronicles a young girl's rise from <br/>
poverty in a Japanese fishing village to life in high society.<br/>
<br/>
The lead role of Sayuri will go to Zhang Ziyi, the Chinese actress <br/>
who starred in "Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon" and appeared in the <br/>
comedy "Rush Hour 2," her publicist said Thursday.<br/>
<br/>
For those unfamiliar with the story, a geisha is a Japanese woman <br/>
schooled in the art of dance, singing and conversation to be a <br/>
companion for wealthy men.<br/>
<br/>
Zhang, 25, has been working to perfect her English for several years <br/>
and now speaks the language with little difficulty.<br/>
<br/>
"This is the first time that I will play the lead in an English-<br/>
language movie. It will be a big challenge, but the studios, <br/>
producers and director have shown great confidence in me. I will <br/>
continue to do my utmost to make this the best role I've ever <br/>
played," she told The Associated Press.<br/>
<br/>
Ken Watanabe, an Oscar nominee for "The Last Samurai," will portray <br/>
the Chairman, a high-powered executive with whom Sayuri falls in love.<br/>
<br/>
Another "Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon" co-star, Michelle Yeoh, has <br/>
signed to portray Mameha, the elegant and experienced geisha who <br/>
becomes Sayuri's mentor.<br/>
<br/>
"Geisha" will be directed by Rob Marshall, the Oscar-nominated <br/>
director of "Chicago."<br/>
<br/>
Marshall has long wanted to make this his next project, but was <br/>
locked into a contract with Miramax Films, while Columbia Pictures <br/>
and DreamWorks SKG held the rights to "Geisha." After lengthy <br/>
negotiations that threatened to block his participation, a deal was <br/>
eventually reached among the studios.<br/>
<br/>
"We could not be more excited about the extraordinary cast that we <br/>
have in place for 'Memoirs of a Geisha,"' said Marshall, who's also a <br/>
Tony-winning director and choreographer. "We are adapting a beloved <br/>
piece of literature that has become a worldwide sensation, which made <br/>
it important to me to assemble a cast with a prestigious <br/>
international profile."<br/>
<br/>
For many years, Steven Spielberg was interested in directing the <br/>
film. He will now serve as a producer.<br/>
<br/>
"From the time I first read Arthur Golden's novel, I wanted to see <br/>
this as a film," Spielberg said. "It's a uniquely compelling story <br/>
rich with characters who take you into a world you have never <br/>
experienced before."<br/>
<br/>
Production is set to begin in the fall, but the release date has not <br/>
yet been specified.</div>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-58166233">Zhang Ziyi and Michelle Yeoh? <br/>
<br/>
While I definitely think both are easy on the eyes,<br/>
how on EARTH are they going to convince ANYONE they're<br/>
Japanese? <br/>
<br/>
Oh, wait...it's an American movie...which means no one<br/>
cares...<br/>
<br/>
Damn.<br/>

It amazes me that they just didn't get a "hot young star" who was <br/>
American and (attempt to) make her look Asian with makeup. And that <br/>
Tom Cruise wasn't cast as the chairman.<br/>
And the movie is going to be in English?!?!?! Crap.</div>
