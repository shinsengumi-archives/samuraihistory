<br/>
By Jason Wallis<br/>
<br/>
Recently, I expressed my distaste for director Zhang Yimou's <br/>
critically lauded swordplay film "Hero," which for all its pretty <br/>
colors and elaborate fight scenes failed to represent anything <br/>
meaningful, or even entertaining. Hollow and lifeless, it was an <br/>
insult to a genre that I hold in high regard. For those, like me, <br/>
who were disheartened by that film, "The Blind Swordsman: Zatoichi" <br/>
serves as a fine antidote. As written and directed by Japanese pop <br/>
culture icon "Beat" Takeshi Kitano, it boasts everything that "Hero" <br/>
lacked. It is a shame that Kitano's film is only playing in select <br/>
cities while Yimou's received a nationwide theatrical release, <br/>
but "Zatoichi" is a strong enough movie to overcome such a handicap, <br/>
provided moviegoers learn of its existence.<br/>
<br/>
In addition to serving as writer and director, Kitano is also the <br/>
movie's star. He plays the title character, a blind swordsman who <br/>
wanders the countryside righting wrongs and defending the honor of <br/>
those who show him kindness. He's a mild-mannered old man, content <br/>
to leave in peace, yet not hesitant to draw his sword if necessary. <br/>
He dispatches his victims with lightning-quick ferocity, using <br/>
his "Zen" awareness and heightened sense of hearing to anticipate <br/>
his foes' attacks. His skill with a blade makes The Bride look like <br/>
a child playing with sticks.<br/>
The original "Zatoichi" series was comprised of 26 separate films, <br/>
but Kitano does not riff from any one film in his tribute to the <br/>
samurai classics. His "Zatoichi" presents more of an amalgamation of <br/>
different genre staples: warring gangs fighting for territorial <br/>
control; villagers terrorized by the gangs' heartless thugs; <br/>
siblings seeking revenge against the bosses who murdered their <br/>
family. Kitano does a good job of intertwining the different plot <br/>
threads, though the story is at times needlessly confusing.<br/>
<br/>
The fight scenes fare better thanks to the filmmaker's understanding <br/>
of what makes for good action: speed, excitement, coherence, and <br/>
lots and lots of blood. The fights are few and perhaps more far <br/>
between than some would like, but when they come, they're fast and <br/>
furious. Although it is often obvious that computer effects played <br/>
too big a role in the visuals schemes of some scenes, you'll be too <br/>
busy admiring the precise choreography to care about such details.<br/>
<br/>
Regrettably, I have only seen two of Kitano's other <br/>
films: "Sonatine," a disposable black comedy about a group of <br/>
yakuza, and "Fireworks," a brilliant police drama that defies <br/>
superficial description. Though "Zatoichi" is completely unlike <br/>
either of those films in both plot and theme, it is filled with the <br/>
same playful blend of quirky comedy and brutal, stylized violence, <br/>
and it is unmistakably the work of a filmmaker in complete control <br/>
of his craft. Even though his movie operates within the framework of <br/>
an old-fashioned samurai epic, Kitano infuses "Zatoichi" with <br/>
elements from several conflicting genres, including slapstick comedy <br/>
and, more interestingly, the musical. The contrasting styles meld <br/>
seamlessly, making this one of the most unusual films of the year.<br/>
<br/>
Note: "Zatoichi" is showing at the Tower Theater in Sacramento.<br/>
<br/>
"The Blind Swordsman: Zatoichi" is rated R for graphic violence, <br/>
gore and adult themes.<br/>
