<div id="ygrps-yiv-162629999">I caught (most of) a reasonably well done documentary on the history <br/>
channel on the samurai Saturday night. Nowadays, the drek that is fed people <br/>
on TLC, THC, and National Geographic makes me cringe. Even when they do have <br/>
knowledgeable people giving them information, the producers tend to feed the <br/>
myths rather than rely on research. I spent the better part of 2 hours <br/>
watching without having to cry *bull$hit* once. I was greatly surprised. It <br/>
did seem to me that I had seen a lot of this footage previously in shows <br/>
where I DID cry bull$hit. It's almost as if their consultants sat down with <br/>
them and actually cross checked everything before release. Kind of a <br/>
historian's cut. It seemed that Conlan and Friday had a lot more influence <br/>
on this one.<br/>
<br/>
  The title was The Samurai which of course makes it easy to differentiate <br/>
from other documentaries about samurai. :)<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-905627419">The PBS series on Japan was fairly good as well.  Although, the information was rather basic. That is available on DVD in  a 3-part series, and I believe all the HC documentaries are available  for purchase on their site or can be ordered through Border's. They can  be expensive though.<br/>
