<h3>My own excerpt</h3>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-185448368">Well, since its ok for publishing rights, I guess I should go ahead <br/>
and post the excerpt I've been handing out. Tony, Nate, I know you <br/>
two will tear it apart best as possible so I won't bother asking. <g><br/>
<br/>
BTW, this is the very begining of the book, its just kind of meant <br/>
to set up the time and introduce the people to (basically) what the <br/>
time and place was like.<br/>
<br/>
--<br/>
March 15, 1854, Edo<br/>
<br/>
	The American sailor walked into the restaurant, his <br/>
translator trailing quietly behind.<br/>
	"Order me a drink," he told his translator, sitting down at <br/>
a table. "Whiskey."<br/>
	"No whiskey," the translator said, shaking his head. "Sake. <br/>
Rice wine."<br/>
	"Rice wine?!" the sailor asked incredulously. "Don't you <br/>
people eat enough of that stuff? Now you've got me drinking it, too! <br/>
Yeah, sure, order me some of that. It's good, right?"<br/>
	"Very good," the translator nodded. He turned to the waiting <br/>
waitress, ordering some of the wine. Turning back to the sailor, he <br/>
said, "Bathroom," and then walked off.<br/>
	The waitress came over, putting the wine and two cups down. <br/>
The sailor glanced up, saying, "Thank you." When the waitress gave <br/>
him a blank, confused look, he quickly realized his error. "Ah sheh <br/>
sheh?"<br/>
	"That is Chinese," a gruff voice came from behind the <br/>
sailor. An important looking man with a long and short sword tied to <br/>
his waist came up and sat down across from him. He wore odd pants, <br/>
almost a cross between trousers and a skirt, along with a flowing <br/>
robe covered by a simple, stiff-sleeved jacket. His hair was shaved <br/>
from his forehead to the top, and the back was tied into an odd-<br/>
looking ponytail that sat atop his head. "Say, `Arigato'," he <br/>
instructed the sailor.<br/>
	"Oh." The sailor turned to the waitress. "Arigato," he said <br/>
to her.<br/>
	Smiling at the sailor with the realization of what he'd been <br/>
trying to say, she bowed, saying "Do itashimashite," and walked off.<br/>
	"You are American," the Japanese man said.<br/>
	"And you're Nipponese," the sailor commented dryly.<br/>
	"I am samurai," the Japanese replied, a slight indignation <br/>
in his voice. "You are with the black ships."<br/>
	"Black ships?" the sailor asked. "Oh, yeah. I'm with the <br/>
black ships."<br/>
	"May I ask you a question?" The samurai asked.<br/>
	"Sure, shoot," the sailor said, pouring some sake into a cup.<br/>
	"Why is it so important to America that Japan open up?" the <br/>
samurai asked. "I spoke to a Chinese man. He claimed that America is <br/>
the land of gold."<br/>
	"Yeah, we got gold," the sailor said. He swallowed the sake <br/>
hard. A split second passed, and his eyes went wide and he gagged.<br/>
	"You drink sake too fast," the samurai said, slight <br/>
amusement showing in his eyes. "Sip sake."<br/>
	"Sip it, right" the sailor said, nodding his head, his face <br/>
still red with discomfort.<br/>
	"So, if America is a land of gold, why does America care <br/>
about Japan? What do we have that you could want?" the samurai asked.<br/>
	"Well, this sake isn't all that bad," the sailor said, <br/>
sipping a little.<br/>
	"You want sake?" the samurai said, bewildered.<br/>
	"Sorry, that was a joke," the sailor said. "You Nipponese <br/>
need to get out more."<br/>
	"We like how we are," the samurai said. "We do not want to <br/>
get out more."<br/>
	"But don't you want to trade? China opened its borders and <br/>
now it trades a lot," the sailor said.<br/>
	"What good is trade?" the samurai asked. "China belongs to <br/>
Barbarians now. They are ruined by Opium; they have lost everything <br/>
for trade."<br/>
	The sailor stopped and thought. "To be honest, I can't give <br/>
you a straight answer. I'm just a sailor."<br/>
	"I see." Samurai nodded. "Here in Japan, men like you are in <br/>
charge."<br/>
	"Men like me?" the sailor asked, daring to take another sip <br/>
of his sake.<br/>
	"Warriors," the samurai said. "Bushi."<br/>
	"We chose who's in charge," the sailor said, pausing to take <br/>
another sip, "in America. All the people, that is," he added.<br/>
	"All the people?" the samurai asked, confused.<br/>
	"Every four years, we all vote on some people who want to <br/>
run our country, and whoever gets the most votes, they run it for <br/>
four years until we vote again," the sailor said. "At least, I think <br/>
that's how it works."<br/>
	"Here, in Japan, a member of the Tokugawa house runs the <br/>
country," the samurai explained.<br/>
	"Like a king," the sailor nodded. "We used to be like that. <br/>
But then we had a revolution."<br/>
	"A revolution?" the samurai asked, confused.<br/>
	"Yeah," the sailor said. He paused, sighed, and took another <br/>
sip of the sake. It was quickly becoming apparent that this would <br/>
never be his drink of choice. "A bunch of farmers got together and <br/>
beat back the British."<br/>
	"That happened here," the samurai said. "But the farmers <br/>
lost."<br/>
	"Well," the sailor shrugged, not sure what to say. He took <br/>
another sip of his sake, and refilled his cup.<br/>
	"Do you think we will have a revolution here?" the samurai <br/>
asked the sailor. "It has been peaceful for so long."<br/>
	The sailor shrugged. "Up to you Nipponese, I guess."<br/>
	The samurai nodded. "My son, he has two children. They were <br/>
born three years ago. I hope that there will be no revolution, or <br/>
else they will have to fight it."<br/>
	"So you're a grandfather, huh?" the sailor asked, glancing <br/>
at him, a little surprised. "You sure look young."<br/>
	"Samurai are warriors meant for war, but my family has been <br/>
happy farming in Okinawa for the last one hundred and seventy five <br/>
years. I do not think that should change for my grandchildren," the <br/>
samurai continued.<br/>
	"So you guys have done nothing but fight for the last couple <br/>
hundred years?" the sailor asked, confused. "Who do you fight?"<br/>
	"Rival daimyo used to fight," the samurai explained. "Long <br/>
ago. But since the Tokugawa clan came out on top, there has been <br/>
peace for over two hundred and fifty years."<br/>
	"Daimyo?" the sailor asked. "I don't know what that means."<br/>
	"They are the generals, the lords of the land," the samurai <br/>
explained. "We samurai would swear allegiance to them in battle."<br/>
	"Well, if you haven't been fighting for so long, what have <br/>
you been doing?" the sailor wondered.<br/>
	"We have been many things," the samurai said. "Mostly we <br/>
have been keeping the peace. The Shogunate rewards us for that."<br/>
	"Shogunate? You mean your king?" the sailor questioned.<br/>
	"The person who runs our country is called Seii tai shogun, <br/>
or just Shogun," the samurai replied. "His government is called the <br/>
Shogunate, or the Bakufu."<br/>
	"Too many names," the sailor said, shaking his head. He <br/>
glanced at the swords tied to the samurai's waist. "What about <br/>
those? Why do you still have swords? And why two?"<br/>
	"This is called a daisho," the samurai said, reaching down <br/>
and gripping the longer of the two swords. "It is our right, our <br/>
duty to wear these swords. No one else may wear them."<br/>
	"But don't you have guns?" the sailor continued. "We stopped <br/>
using swords I think before we even made my country."<br/>
	"We have guns," the samurai said. "My sons and I are good <br/>
marksmen. But our swords and spears are still useful."<br/>
	"Spears, too?" the sailor gave him an inquisitive look. "You <br/>
guys are behind on the times a little."<br/>
	"We use swords as a symbol more than as a weapon," the <br/>
samurai explained. "They are our soul. Our guns are saved for the <br/>
fields, and the spears are good for cavalry."<br/>
	"Ever seen a gun like this?" the sailor asked, reaching <br/>
behind him. However, he was interrupted as his interpreter returned. <br/>
The man paid his respects to the samurai, then turned to the sailor.<br/>
	"We must go," he said.<br/>
	The sailor sighed, getting up and paying for the sake.<br/>
	"Have the rest, if you like," he offered the samurai, <br/>
pushing the unused cup towards him.<br/>
	"Wait," the samurai said, getting up. "Times are about to <br/>
change, I know it." He took the short sword from his side, handing <br/>
it to the sailor. "When you go back to America, to trade with us, <br/>
keep this. It will be our first trade."<br/>
	The sailor blinked in surprise at the short sword. "This for <br/>
some bad wine? Well, I don't know anything about this thing, but I <br/>
can guess it's not a fair trade." He reached behind him, pulling out <br/>
a brand new level action pistol Smith and Wesson. "Here," he said, <br/>
handing it to the samurai. "No offense to your swords and all that, <br/>
but I bet you'll find this more useful."<br/>
	The samurai took it and looked it over. He bowed deeply. "My <br/>
name is Mono Kenshu, from Okinawa, in Satsuma."<br/>
	The sailor gave an awkward return bow. "I'm Joe Lewis, from <br/>
Louisiana," he said, turning and walking out with his interpreter.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-289763906">Kyle et al-<br/>
	I have to say I liked this considerably better than the earlier <br/>
excerpt (apologies to Lillith). This is my favorite area of Japanese <br/>
history so I may be too harsh a critic.  "Restaurant", "waitress" and <br/>
"bathroom" are all too modern and invoke the "groan" and  catapult the <br/>
reader back into his world rather than keep him in yours. "Public <br/>
House", "Tea room" or even "eatery" might work better, as would <br/>
"servant-girl" and "outhouse" (privy). If it is 1854 then the language <br/>
you use should invoke the 1850's, since we are close enough in time <br/>
that most readers know what it should sound like (as opposed to the <br/>
1550"s).<br/>
	 A single sailor strolls into a bar? All joking aside, in 1854 it is <br/>
unlikely that Commodore Perry would have allowed any of the men of his <br/>
command this kind of casual contact. Servant girls didn't hang around <br/>
the table and "unn" was likely all the thanks she expected to receive. <br/>
Domo Arigato-doitashimashite are again too modern, and jolt the reader <br/>
out of the story. I think a samurai of these times would not call <br/>
himself a "samurai" but rather "Bushi", if he has a good command of <br/>
English then "warrior." However if he is giving Japanese lessons he <br/>
should say "Bakufu",  I do not think he would have command of words <br/>
like "Shogunate" which is afterall an English word.<br/>
	Mono Kenshu? Okinawans have funky names true, but farming samurai from <br/>
Okinawa? Satsuma. Yes, I don't buy Okinawa. Josiah Louis, Joseph Louis, <br/>
Jebediah Louis I could accept, "Joe" again sounds too modern. I also <br/>
wonder how open-minded a working class white male from the American <br/>
South of the 1850's might be toward Asians and their culture. If he <br/>
were black he wouldn't be walking around with an interpreter and if he <br/>
were important enough to be granted an interpreter he would likely not <br/>
be strolling into a pub. And what about the interpreter!?! What does he <br/>
interpret? When the Samurai speaks, is it his English we hear or is <br/>
that the interpreter?<br/>
	I know I am picking nits here, so don't take me too seriously. Alot of <br/>
my questions/concerns could easily be answered by the tale that is <br/>
about to unfold. Tom Cruise movies aside this is certainly a period and <br/>
place in history that is ripe for literary and theatrical dramatization <br/>
and I for one am all for it.<br/>
-t<br/>
<br/>
PS- I feel that the US was looking to beat the Europeans to Pacific <br/>
Whaling to replace that lost in the Atlantic which was "overfished", <br/>
coaling stations in Japan were vital to that effort, "trade and amity" <br/>
were the sugar-coating used to sell the idea of open ports to Japan...</div>
