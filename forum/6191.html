Delightful.  Thanks for the recommendations.  I'd never heard of these.  I<br/>
look forward to them.<br/>
As to "Seven Samurai" - not only has it been released with revised<br/>
subtitles, it's been restored to its original release length - which had<br/>
previously not been shown outside of a few major Japanese cities in its<br/>
first run.  A student of mine also has a DVD version that includes the<br/>
theatrical trailer for the film, which is pretty delightful in itself.  But<br/>
both of these have been out long enough that I'm not sure either one is what<br/>
you're referring to.<br/>

A couple of other movies:<br/>
<br/>
Ame Agaru (After the Rain) - a gentle story<br/>
<br/>
Twilight Samurai - another gentle story with some nice kodachi work for<br/>
those who recall<br/>
previous discussions here...<br/>
<br/>
... and Gohatto, more 'gay' than 'gentle', again with some excellent dojo<br/>
fencing which<br/>
contrasts nicely with the somewhat wild 'cut n slash' of 'the real thing'.<br/>
<br/>
The Kurosawas are, of course, mandatory.<br/>
<br/>
I have heard Seven Samurai is being re-released with revised subtitling<br/>
which is somewhat<br/>
more 'earthy' than the 50's version. Anyone know anything about this?<br/>
