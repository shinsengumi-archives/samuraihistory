Abstract. "After three centuries of virtually no official contacts, <br/>
in 1862 the Japanese government dispatched a ship to Shanghai to <br/>
investigate international trade and commerce in China's largest port <br/>
city. Many of the Japanese left stirring accounts of their <br/>
experiences there. They also just happened to confront the Taiping <br/>
Rebellion, probably the largest peasant rebellion in history till <br/>
then, when Taiping forces attacked the Chinese city while the <br/>
Japanese were there.<br/>
<br/>
Eighty-two years later, in 1944, the Japanese made a movie on <br/>
location in occupied Shanghai about that voyage of 1862. The film <br/>
was lost at war's end and only rediscovered in late 2001.<br/>
<br/>
My presentation will look first at the initial voyage, then at the <br/>
movie and the message it sought to convey, and finally at why sixty <br/>
years since it was shot and 140 years since the mission took place, <br/>
the story retains such extraordinary poignancy today."</div>
