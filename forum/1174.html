    Tell Kimura san "Big Tom" sent you. Be sure to give yourself an hour to walk in the graveyard on<br/>
<br/>
the hillside above the Museum. All the shishi who died in Kyoto during the Bakumatsu are there<br/>
including Sakamoto Ryoma and Nakaoka Shintaro.<br/>
    Also look for the book "Ryoma no Kyo" for 2000 yen it is a great guide to Bakumatsu related<br/>
sites in Kyoto-<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1964443637"><blockquote><span title="ireply">> Thanks, William and Tom for the information on this museum. I managed to <br/>
 </span></blockquote>get to it on Friday. It's really worth a visit, with some memorable exhibits: there is <br/>
a special exhibition on at the moment on Sakamoto Ryoma. It's a shame that <br/>
there are no English explanations at all. I didn't really leave enough time to <br/>
decipher every sign. The tombstones of the Meiji heroes behind the museum <br/>
are also very interesting.<br/>
<br/>
I went to the Osaka Prefectural History museum too. It's terrific and gives lots of <br/>
insights into the daily life of the city. If anyone's visiting Osaka I'd recommend <br/>
spending a few hours there. <br/>
<br/>
Now I'm back in Yamaguchi, thinking about Choshu: if anyone wants to discuss <br/>
Choshu's role in the Meiji Restoration it would be good to exchange ideas.<br/>
