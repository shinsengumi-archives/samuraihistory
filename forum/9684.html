<h3>Samurai  and Ninja Project for secondary students</h3>
by <i>annakwild</i>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1908752300">Hi I teach Japanese to years 7-12 kids in Victoria and am planning on <br/>
doing a research/language assignment with them on ninja and samurai <br/>
history.  I need to get the boys engaged in particular and figure this <br/>
would be a good topic.  I have found heaps of information on the web <br/>
about weapons, clothing etc but need more information on the types of <br/>
housing samurai and ninja's lived in, what training they did and their <br/>
diet.  Any info, web links or suggestions would be really appreciated.  <br/>
Thank you!</div>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1775851869">check out almost anything by Stephen Turnbull.He will be a good source <br/>
of information on almost anything samurai.especially recommended would <br/>
be "Warriors of Midieval Japan" and "Samurai:The World of the Warrior".<br/>
hope this helps a bit.<br/>
