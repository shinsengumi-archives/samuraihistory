 </span></blockquote>Hah, yeah I almost put OT in the subject line due to the lack of<br/>
Hayes/ninja references in my post...<br/>
 <br/>
Many thanks for the suggestions, I've added Borgen's book to my<br/>
ever-growing Wishlist, and was about to do the same with the Kodansha<br/>
Encyclopedia until I saw the price... eep! Might have to check the state<br/>
library for that one me thinks!<br/>
 <br/>
Thanks,<br/>

 </span></blockquote>the Kodansha Encyclopedia has a wonderful online version. (http:// <br/>
www.ency-japan.com) Some universities subscribe to it, so students  <br/>
can access it for free. perhaps, some of the members of this ML might  <br/>
want to consider a "group" subscription.<br/>

Or else, here is another criminal idea, in the name of culture: since  <br/>
the encyclopedia has a free 30 days trial, every month a different  <br/>
member of this list should go for that, and share with the others.<br/>
<br/>
Not sure if it takes your I.P to let you connect, but i doubt it.<br/>
Well, one day to find out it would be to try!!<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Cepo, our devious minds think alike! I found this website earlier too<br/>
and <br/>
looked at the 30-day sign-up, however it's not quite as simple as just <br/>
putting an e-mail address and PRESTO you have a username and password.<br/>
Among <br/>
the details you need to submit are an  'Institution name' (and I don't<br/>
think <br/>
'Samurai History Forum' will cut it!) as well as 'Insitution IP<br/>
Address'. <br/>
But hey, you've got to give them some points for looking like they are<br/>
cluey <br/>
enough to lock down on activities like we both managed to plot in our<br/>
heads!<br/>
