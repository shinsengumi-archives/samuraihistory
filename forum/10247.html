Hello,Iam sorry that I don't have the information that you are looking<br/>
for,but I was wondering since you have traveled to Kyoto however that you<br/>
just might be able to give me some guidance.<br/>
   A few years ago I was given A beautiful Rin Gong or Singing bowl have<br/>
since learned that It is from the Tokugawa Shogunate.It is apparent from the<br/>
hollyhock mon,or family crest.There is one that is very similar to mine on<br/>
Wikipedia under singing bowl's. I was hoping that you had experienced the<br/>
purpose of the ceremony regarding the beautiful sound of the bowl.<br/>
    If you have any idea or maybe know of someone who does I would love to<br/>
know.I can send you a photo if you'd like.<br/>
            I Thank You so very much for your time and look forward to<br/>
hearing from you.<br/>
                         Once again Thank You,     Sincerely  Holly Lange<br/>

there was once a segment about a man who had a collection of "singing bowls".  I put these keywords into google and turned up a lot on Tibetan singing bowls [  antiques roadshow england "singing bowls"  ], but a search withing the hits using [ japan  ] turned up this link<br/>
