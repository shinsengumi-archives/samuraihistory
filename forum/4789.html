<div id="ygrps-yiv-2000833630">hi, i'm new member here. actually my knowledge of samurai is very<br/>
limited to what I've seen in anime and Kurosawa Akira's films. but<br/>
we're planning to make story-RPG (forum) based on samurai/ninja life.<br/>
and I think it's better to put some basic informations as guide. <br/>
<br/>
I guess I'd better go around at samurai-archive first before asking<br/>
here (while the answer is already there) :D<br/>
Happy new year!<br/>
