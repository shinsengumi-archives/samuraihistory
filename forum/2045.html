<div id="ygrps-yiv-769484595">Hiya, my name's Sam and, as you must suspect, I love japanese <br/>
history, specially the samurai. I am currently writing a story set in <br/>
the last years of the 16th century (a little bit before Tokugawa took <br/>
power), obviously I need to do research to not mess up too much. In <br/>
this story I have used the names of Himura, Shimizu, and Iwamura, all <br/>
as powerful clans. The fact is I don't know about the real history of <br/>
these clans, just used the names and made up some of their history <br/>
for the purposes of the story - which is fantasy-based. Then again, <br/>
if I can find out about their history, much better!<br/>
<br/>
Well, that's all for now, any specific inquiries that I might have <br/>
I'll let ya guys know. Thanks!<br/>
