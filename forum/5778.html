I have met Ian severaL times over tha pst few years at<br/>
the armouries. Always foundhim to be very welcoming<br/>
and exstremely friendly even when he dont recogise me<br/>
or remember me at first from perevious visits.<br/>
<br/>
My first meeting with him was out of this world, he<br/>
not only took me to the storage area but then took me<br/>
to the public display and explained what many of the<br/>
main items on display were.<br/>
<br/>
He has been most helpful in my (self taught) study of<br/>
armour making, it was he would told  me to search out<br/>
Anthony's armour site. with the site and Ian's one on<br/>
one I managed to produce a very nice set of armoured<br/>
sleeves.<br/>
<br/>
I have always found him very responsive to emails as<br/>
well when I have had questions to ask.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-749328227">Hi Folks,<br/>
<br/>
I spoke to Ian a few months back, he's still with us, but is really deep<br/>
in to his work at the armouries. Ian is most definitely into firearms,<br/>
right down to having reproduced a replica of a rare Japanese wheellock<br/>
pistol for himself. And I concur with Paul, he is a terrifically helpful<br/>
chap. Without his help our samurai re-enactment project, wouldn't have<br/>
even got off the starting blocks. Not only did he spend a day with us<br/>
studying the Snows Hill collection, plus numerous trips to see his own,<br/>
he lent our armourer one of his own dou to copy, and gave us a lot of<br/>
the "insiders" knowledge essential to reproducing high quality replica<br/>
arms, armour and clothing. We owe that man a lot:-)<br/>
<br/>
Also as I mentioned in an earlier post, it was he, together with Stephen<br/>
Turnbull who were responsible for the presentation of all that new stuff<br/>
on the evolution of Japanese firearms at the Armouries a few years back,<br/>
blowing the myth of the European responsibility for the introduction of<br/>
firearms to the Japanese out of the water, so to speak. <br/>
<br/>
Yours<br/>
<br/>
Dean<br/>
