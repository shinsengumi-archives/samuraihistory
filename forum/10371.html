<div id="ygrps-yiv-1372012968">I hope you've been getting something out of the Samurai Archives Podcast so far -- next we'll be covering the Sengoku period, and will be hosting a Q&A, so send your questions along, and we'll answer them on air.  For anyone not familiar with the Sengoku period, remember those sweeping epic Samurai battles you saw in movies and Anime?  That's the Sengoku period, populated by such famous figures as Oda Nobunaga, Takeda Shingen, Uesugi Kenshin, and a ton of others.  So send along your questions, easy, basic, complex, or hard, doesn't matter, and we'll do our best to answer them!<br/>

<br/>
I would love to learn more about the Otate no ran.  I have previously posted here regarding this topic, and a few people were kind enough to respond (in public or personally), but in the end most were also left wondering "what happened exactly".<br/>
<br/>
Essentially, what transpired from Kenshin's death (or before) until Kagekatsu fully takes control of the Uesugi, forces Kagetora's suicide, and eventually stabilizes the Uesugi domain.  So, ~1578-1580.<br/>
Based on Samurai Archives, it sounds like both Kagetora and Kagekatsu manage to gain at least some support amongst the Uesugi retainer band.<br/>
<br/>
Alternatively, if anyone else has found some information, I would love to hear what you have found.<br/>
<br/>
thanks!<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-2049301924">A lot rest to be done on the Sengoku period. I have in mind some of the black holes in western language : Iwami province (Yoshimi, Masuda, Sufu and other families), the Nambu in Mutsu, Hyûga in Kyûshû, the Yamana in the Sanindô, Hida province, and some others. If required, I can supply the genealogies of the above-mentioned clans but not their history.<br/>

A lot of the questions/comments are too specific or specialized for our general overview of the Sengoku period (so if you have any more generalized Sengoku-era questions, fire away), but we will keep them in mind for later podcasts after the Introduction to Japanese History series has been completed.</div>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-20141073">Are there landmarks, ie battles, campaigns or the rise say of  <br/>
particular clans that we can point to that illustrate the on-going  <br/>
development of arms and armour and battlefiled strategy? knowing this  <br/>
is could cover almost 250 years I expect there would be more than one  <br/>
and in some cases info is lost or not available. BUT if you could map  <br/>
out a timeline and say "here we see this used succesfully" and "Here  <br/>
we see this for the last time" I should be very interested to hear  <br/>
what subjects come up...<br/>
