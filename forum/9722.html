<h3>Swords from Century</h3>

<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1300363516">Being a  specialist in Nihonto, I can recommend some places.  You could try  <br/>
centuryfitness.com, they have a new signature sword collection, and since it  <br/>
is in dollars it would be pretty cheap in <br/>
pounds.  Also, I would give  Bugei.com a try.  Be warned about century <br/>
though, their swords are not  traditionally forged.<br/>
DO NOT BUY A SWORD FROM CENTURY!!! The Signature Series is made by Hanwei.  <br/>
The rest is just junk. Bugei, also gets their swords from Hanwei. Check out <br/>
_www.casiberia.com_ (http://www.casiberia.com)  . If you are looking for  <br/>
replica's, Hanwei is the way to go. Not cheap, but a high level of  quality.<br/>

	While these are interesting to look at, and may do the job of test  <br/>
cutting, they lack that certain something, they  are not quite right,  <br/>
someone who knows nihonto can see it everytime and it is a big  <br/>
detractor. I still contend that these will not become collectibles  <br/>
like some Shinsakuto surely will, if as a newbie you can afford $2k  <br/>
for one of these I think you could easily save for a year and find a  <br/>
true nihonto that will appreciate for around $5k, and a little study  <br/>
goes a long way...<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Wait, Clive Sinclaire? I got an email from Clive Sinclaire?  You are <br/>
one of my favorite authors!  This is unbelievable.  I learned a ton <br/>
of what I know from your book on Samurai arms & armor.</div>
