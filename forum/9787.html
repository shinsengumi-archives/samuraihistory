<div id="ygrps-yiv-702741509">I would recommend reading through the samurai archives or other informational sites first (link at the bottom of the screen)... The answers for this could just get very long. If you have more specific questions after that, Im sure more people would be willing to help. <br/>
<br/>
In short though, the word "samurai" is derived from the verb meaning "to serve." Serving is a critical concept to the idea of the samurai and tells one something about the role of the samurai/their function in society. <br/>
<br/>
Is it practiced today? The question is a difficult one because as a way of life, I'm sure some people in the modern world (ex. Yukio Mishima) would think it is, but the bushi as a class of people ended long ago. <br/>
<br/>
Good luck in your pursuits,<br/>

I joined this history group for my love of history, and I believe in the ways of the old. So I can personally answer your question: yes, the ways are still followed, and although there are those that say that the ways of the samurai are obsolete, or don't function in these times, they will not likely die out as long as people still believe in them. In fact, the spirit of old Japan seems to be coming back in popularity (even after the nightmares of world war 2 and the communist and socialist movement in Japan).<br/>

 </span></blockquote>  Hi James,<br/>
<br/>
  I'm very glad to know you are interested in such a authentic real <br/>
Japanese historical issue.<br/>
<br/>
  Please let me explain the issue of Samurai  , one by one, because it <br/>
is involved so many things and long, long story indeed about 1,400 <br/>
years history.<br/>
<br/>
   Auchaeologically, Samurai ( Buke in auchaeological term )  was born <br/>
to protect rich farmers, rich peerage, and Emperor even, from <br/>
burglars , robbers arround 1,400 years ago.   In the rearly <br/>
origin ,some poor  farmaers armed strongly  were hired as the gard <br/>
men , or small family of peerage as well.  So, no body knows who was <br/>
the first Samurai , the name of person of first Samurai.<br/>
    In fact, Samurai were , originally ,  the lowest  rank of social <br/>
stratum ( higher than slaves ) .  Isn't it interesting  for you ?<br/>
   In Japan, before the birth of Samurai, Emperor , Peerage, Farmers, <br/>
Merchant, Producers were the main stratum . <br/>
<br/>
    And then, gradually, Buke became more people  and stronger and <br/>
stronger and had power to control Farmers, Merchant, Producers.<br/>
<br/>
    So,  Samurai means Buke , to protect or gard somebody others.<br/>
<br/>
      The historical story about Samurai is over for today.  TO BE <br/>
CONTINUED.  (   After the above history, another interesting thing you <br/>
can know ).<br/>
    Looking forward to hearing your comment on the above.<br/>
<br/>
  (  At present,  of cause, no more  Samurai exists.  Please see " Last <br/>
Samurai "  ,  the famous movie.  How to terminate, I'll let you know <br/>
later.)<br/>

 </span></blockquote><Snipped><br/>
<br/>
Eddie did a good job trying to lay out a very complex topic.  I want<br/>
to mention a few things that may have been missed in reading his post.<br/>
<br/>
1400 years ago (age of the Kojiki and Nihonshiki), as he mentioned,<br/>
there do appear to be warriors who are hired on to protect various<br/>
landowners' property.  There were some groups, such as the Mononobe,<br/>
who were specifically considered warriors or warrior families, but for<br/>
the most part any kind of soldiers appear to have been lower class<br/>
folks.  In fact, as you enter the Ritsuryo period, you have soldiers<br/>
called up by conscription from the various communities, rather than a<br/>
warrior class, per se.<br/>
<br/>
The word 'samurai', as Eddie mentions, comes from the word 'saburafu',<br/>
'to serve'.  (Saburafu->Saburahi->Samurai; not sure if that is the<br/>
*exact* path the word took).<br/>
<br/>
Dr. Karl Friday has a good book on this subject, whose title I'm<br/>
blanking on but if you search on his name you will no doubt find it.<br/>
<br/>
Trying to summarize some of what comes next: On the edges of the<br/>
Yamato polity, it appears that administration often had to rely on<br/>
force against the local population, and as provincial governors turned<br/>
their attention more towards the courts, local administrators were<br/>
left with a freer reign in the outer territories, and having a<br/>
standing group of warriors was much more effective than trying to<br/>
conscript a bunch of peasants whenever you needed to exert military<br/>
force.  Much of the power in the East, at least, appears to have been<br/>
concentrated in the hands of people who had the horses and bows to<br/>
exert real power in the region.  This power was legitimized through<br/>
various means, including marriage and alliances with court nobles.<br/>
Eventually, these eastern warriors make their way to the capital,<br/>
chiefly under the employ of descendants of disinherited Imperial<br/>
princes (the Taira and the Minamoto--though there are several groups<br/>
of Minamoto, descending from different Imperial ancestors).<br/>
<br/>
At the same time, the monks of the various temples had also been<br/>
gathering warriors to 'defend' their rights and lands.  Towards the<br/>
end of the Heian period, the temples are descending into the capital<br/>
with warrior-monks and a mikoshi carrying the enshrined spirit of<br/>
their main object of worship.  Most of the Heian capital forces would<br/>
not face them, apparently partly in fear of the bad karma (or other<br/>
ill-effects) they could accrue by attacking the mikoshi.  These<br/>
provincial warriors appear to have had far fewer scruples regarding<br/>
such things, and were initially seen by the court as a counter to the<br/>
temples' power.<br/>
<br/>
I'd say that the real use of military power in the capital was the<br/>
Hogen Disturbance, since it effectively put Taira Kiyomori in a<br/>
position of both political and military power.  After Kiyomori's death<br/>
in the late 12th century, the descendants of his defeated Minamoto foe<br/>
led a military revolt that caused a civil war.<br/>
<br/>
(Question for the room:  I believe this is the first time that the<br/>
various military forces competed without being directly led by an<br/>
Emperor or Imperial decree--they may have each claimed Imperial<br/>
Mandate, but every other similar power-struggle conflict I can think<br/>
of seems to be much more directly influenced by the Emperor and his<br/>
Court rather than by the military power structures.)<br/>
<br/>
BTW, although it is known as the Genpei (or Gempei) War (meaning<br/>
Minamoto and Taira), it was much more complex.  For instance, Minamoto<br/>
no Yoritomo was backed by his Hojo supporters--a branch of the Taira<br/>
family that had been given wardship over Yoritomo specifically to<br/>
prevent something of this nature.  Even in the Hogen Disturbance you<br/>
see fathers and sons on separate sides of the disturbance.<br/>
<br/>
Pretty much from this point on, the 'samurai' houses, or buke<br/>
('warrior families'), are in a position of actual political power<br/>
throughout the country.<br/>
<br/>
That is *way* too much of a summary of events, but I'll leave it stand<br/>
so someone can nitpick it and further refine it.<br/>

<br/>
  You did good job to explain about Samurai, Buke  including<br/>
Minamoto, Taira, etc.<br/>
<br/>
  Please let me summarize  Buke things following to my previous<br/>
explanation.  I  said  TO BE CONTINUED.<br/>
<br/>
   Since then, Buke power became  stronger  and stronger as time<br/>
went by.  And  the chief of many of the Buke groupes came out.  That<br/>
is Heike.  Kanmu Emperor had so many wives and so many children as a<br/>
result of it, and finaly  he couln't feed whole of his big family ,<br/>
so he decided to seperate his fourth son, named price Kajiwara as<br/>
HEISI and sentenced  him to become  the chief of Buke group to gard<br/>
Emperor family  and his desendants inherited  HEISI name .  One of<br/>
the groupes of HEISI was ISE HEISI followed by Taira no Kiyomori who<br/>
was the first chief of BUKE  having the power a little bit stronger<br/>
than Emperor and control the political administrative business<br/>
supervising Emperor.<br/>
   However, the emperor at that time, aiming to get back power over<br/>
HEISI  and utilize  Genji group to upset HEISI.<br/>
   Genji was another chief of BUKE groupes .  Emperor SEIWA got so<br/>
many wives and so many children  like Emperor Kanmu before and<br/>
nominated number sixth prine , named SADASUMI as to become the Chief<br/>
of BUKE  as  GENJI  group.  the desendants of SADASUMI  inherited<br/>
Genji group and did the job of gardman for Enmperor.<br/>
   Yoritomo defeatd HEISI and became  the first chief of Genji who<br/>
founded  and was nominated the SHOGUN  and formed government to<br/>
control The political administrative business.<br/>
   Since then,  the chief of BUKE  controled the political<br/>
administrative business , pushed Emperor far a way aside untill the<br/>
end of TOKUGAWA  era.<br/>
<br/>
   The Emperor who used to control policy with the strongest power<br/>
in Japan  have to stay in small place in somewhere in KYOTO without<br/>
no political power , but just religious related power for a long<br/>
time.<br/>
<br/>
    Now at this point ,  here comes very famous question.<br/>
    Why  Emperor  of Japan  was not destroyed .  Why many chieves of<br/>
BUKE  such as  NOBUNAGA,   ASHIKAGA,  TOKUGAWA  didn't wipe out<br/>
Emperor ?    Only Japanese Emperor has been continuing to exist in<br/>
this world since the begining , inheriting only one same blood.<br/>
  The present Emperor (  HEISEI  Emperor ) is the number  125th.<br/>

<h3>Re: Samurai ( Buke in auchaeological term )</h3>
by <i>yoshiyukihiramoto</i>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1945005095">Hi Gillespie,<br/>
<br/>
   Following to your comment and my previous explanation about <br/>
Emperor and BUKE, I like to foward the following comment.<br/>
 <br/>
   My final idea as the answer to why Japanese Emperor can be <br/>
inherited  untill now for over 2,600 years under only one , same <br/>
blood which is ultimately unique and only Japan has in this world <br/>
history of royal family is ....<br/>
<br/>
   In Japan, so many erudites say so many thoughts.<br/>
<br/>
   I believe the contents written in KOJIKI which was the first book <br/>
in Japan and written about the stories and thoughts told from long, <br/>
long time ago before birth of character.  They wrote the thoughts , <br/>
story about the  succession of Emperor.<br/>
<br/>
   They said the origin of Japanese Emperor was AMATERAS OOMIKAMI , <br/>
the god of Sun , and the child between the Japanese first gods for <br/>
whole things , IZANAGI and  IZANAMI .  The number sixth descendant <br/>
from AMATERAS  OOMIKAMI  was the first Emperor ,  JINMU TENNOU ( <br/>
Emperor JINMU )  and was followed by descendants all the way.  <br/>
   Which means Japanese Emperor was believed as God, and Human God <br/>
by Japanese peoples of BUKE groups, Peerrages, Farmers, every body <br/>
since then untill very nowadays.<br/>
   Of course, the present Japanese , except some people, dont belive <br/>
Emperor as the God.  <br/>
   Because of the thought that Emperor is god, other than the <br/>
descendants of Emperor family , inherited Emperor blood, cannot <br/>
sucess the Japanese Emperor.   Even the most powerful Shogun or <br/>
Chief of BUKE  coudn't success the status of Emperor, because they <br/>
were not first position of Emperor family.<br/>
<br/>
  In this book,  KOJIKI, also they said Japanese Emperor can leave <br/>
the power to govern the political affairs of Japanese peoples to <br/>
anybody else, for example  , SHOGUN.  However, Japanese Emperor <br/>
cannot leave the power of religious affairs of people, so , Emperor <br/>
has been continuing to involve in the power of religious things as <br/>
the representative of Japanese god.<br/>
<br/>
    Can you believe this thing ?  I think any foreigners cannot <br/>
believe this thing, but it is understandable.  Emperor is the very <br/>
unique , only Japanese thing in history.<br/>
    If you believe the story , thoughts in KOJIKI , the book of old <br/>
stories  compiled  in  the year of 712 AC ,  you can understand the <br/>
above.<br/>
<br/>
   <br/>

<h3>Re: [samuraihistory] Re: Samurai ( Buke in auchaeological term )</h3>
by <i>tatsushu</i>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-127104189">For some others out there:<br/>
<br/>
HEISI = Heishi or Heiji = Taira ("Taira" is the reading of the first<br/>
character of HEISHI, or at least in this instance)<br/>
GENJI = Minamoto (Again, "Minamoto" is how you read the first<br/>
character of GENJI)<br/>
<br/>
Everything I've seen says that the various branches (many GENJI, only<br/>
one branch of HEISHI) were disinherited (made 'commoners' [read<br/>
'non-imperial nobility']) meaning they and their descendants could not<br/>
ascend to the throne mainly to help cut down on the number of<br/>
succession disputes within the Imperial family.<br/>
<br/>
There were several usurpations/coups that appear in history, but one<br/>
of the requirements has always seemed to have been the rank of<br/>
'Prince'.  There were actually a separate series of ranks for Princes<br/>
apart from the 'common' nobility to distinguish these members of the<br/>
Imperial family.  The usual way around this was to marry your<br/>
daughters into the Imperial line, and thus govern as the grandfather,<br/>
father, or uncle of the emperor.<br/>
<br/>
I'd say one of the first attempts to possibly replace the Emperor, or<br/>
at least attain status as an Imperial prince, was that of Soga no<br/>
Emishi, who seems to have tried to elevate his own son to such a<br/>
position (that may be Fujiwara propoganda, of course).  Later, the<br/>
Fujiwara gain control by marrying their daughters into the Imperial<br/>
line, creating 'Fujiwara' emperors (emperors descended from the<br/>
Imperial and Fujiwara lines).  Part of their power base came from<br/>
being directly related with the sovereign.  In a similar vein, the<br/>
insei government of retired emperors was based largely on them being<br/>
the previous emperors and father or grandfather to the current<br/>
emperor.  It wasn't too far a step for Kiyomori to envision himself<br/>
and his descendants in a similar position, because by his time this<br/>
*was* the accepted means of obtaining power.<br/>
<br/>
That was partly what was so remarkable about Yoritomo;  he really set<br/>
up a warrior government, while Kiyomori, the bridge between courtier<br/>
and warrior, appears to have been trying to model more on the court<br/>
government of the day.  Yoritomo even moved most of the real<br/>
administration out to Kamakura, isolating himself, to an extent, from<br/>
the court nobility.<br/>
<br/>
Ashikaga Yoshimitsu is another interesting character.  He came the<br/>
closest to really doing away with the Imperial power, becoming<br/>
recognized as 'King of Japan' by China, but his descendants ceded much<br/>
of their power to the daimyo and the emperor.<br/>
<br/>
The imperial family does seem to have remained on the throne since at<br/>
least the 6th century, though before that I believe the Kojiki and<br/>
Nihongi (aka Nihon Shoki) are considered less reliable from an<br/>
historical point of view, since dates in them don't always correspond<br/>
to dates of their contemporaries on the mainland, who were keeping<br/>
more meticulous records at the time.  Combine that with the incredible<br/>
symmetry of the early histories of dates of numerological importance,<br/>
and it becomes a matter of debate before then.<br/>

<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-676357445">Please be allowed to make sure the issue is on this topic.<br/>
  That is why Buke,  Taira, Genji, Ashikaga, whatever couldn't ruin <br/>
and succeed the status of Emperor.<br/>
  And you can see the answer in KOJIKI, I said in previous <br/>
explanation.<br/>
<br/>
   One thing , every one should understand that by your present , <br/>
modern sight, even my sight, of course , only a few percent of <br/>
KOJIKI is reliable.   However,  long time ago,  Taira, Genji, <br/>
Ahikaga, Oda, Tokugawa  learned  KOJIKI profoudly through erudites <br/>
at that time and believed the contents written in KOJIKI.<br/>
<br/>
   If a person cannot understand the above thing , there is no other <br/>
way to explain.<br/>
<br/>
    In that case, what is the answer to this question, topic ?<br/>

<h3>Warrior Cultures</h3>

 <br/>
While I have been a member of this group for a few months now, I have been unable to find the time to express why I have found the eurge to join this band of brothers. Well chaps, allow me to reveal my purpose like a shoji door. Next year (Sept 09), I plan to begin my Phd at the University of Bristol where I have recieved a BA and an MA in Ancient History. My Phd will be a comparison between the warriors of Homer's Iliad (Troy etc the ancient history part) and the warriors of 16th century Japan.<br/>
 <br/>
Here are a few area's im particularly interested by with this study:<br/>
<br/>
Divine weapons, and there properties which affect/alter/enhance the bearer<br/>
The interaction/ interferance of gods. spirits, Kami etc to warriors<br/>
Glory, shame and honour in both cultures<br/>
Warrior Cultures in general<br/>
Who commands who? The General's or the famous warriors?<br/>
 <br/>
If anyone knows of any good points, or would like to offer different suggestions of comparison of these cultures, or feel any other knowledge could help in this investigation, that would be a grand help.<br/>

  Warriors ,  BUKE  in  16 Century of Japan.<br/>
<br/>
  Japan used to have many warriors , kings of warriors in 16 <br/>

  Among so many kings of warriors, they used to have Great Two.<br/>
  Takeda Shingen  versus  Uesugi Kensin.<br/>
  Great two used to make wars , 16 times.  <br/>
  After those those big two were dead,  Oda Nobunaga  came up and <br/>
through conjective wars agains other kings of warriors, he came to <br/>
ruin all most  all Japan .   After he was killed by his <br/>
sobordinate , named Akechi  Mitsuhide just  a few days before he is <br/>
going to Emperor palace to get SHogun status who can have power to <br/>
control all kings of warriors under government,  Toyotomi Hideyoshi <br/>
who was another subordinate of Oda ,killed Akechi Mistsuhide and <br/>
ruined all Japan.   He could not become Shogun even he ruined <br/>
completely due to the facts his ancestor was farmers.<br/>
  During his ruin, he tried to conquer Korea and invaded several <br/>
times for nothing.  He failed and waisted man powers and financial <br/>
things.  After he died,  Tokugawa Ieyasu came up and succeeded <br/>
Hideyosi  and became SHOGUN  under the official nomination by <br/>
Emperor because his  ancestors  were Genji group which were the <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-976309621">Actually the term samurai refers to someone who serves someone else. It <br/>
is a variant of the verb to serve which I believe is/was samuru. There <br/>
really isn't anyone that started the samurai. The earliest uses of the <br/>
word samurai refered to mainly house servants in the Heian period. <br/>
Sometimes these duties may have included guard duties. In time the term <br/>
would come to eventually have a mainly military context. One of the <br/>
more proper terms for literally warrior would be bushi武士 .Bushi is <br/>
made up up 2 Chinese caharacters. One being@武　which means military, <br/>
or martial... and the other being m@which means a gentleman, <br/>
nobleman, aristocrat. But, this does not mean that samurai is <br/>
incorrect. Some experts feel that the terms samurai and bushi have <br/>
different implications in their meanings. Some consider bushi to mean <br/>
those who come from military families and have a hereditary occupation <br/>
as profesional warriors. The character m@implying somekind of a <br/>
status and such to that occupation. To be fair, there are those who <br/>
also use the term bushi to describe anyone that gave military service, <br/>
part time farmer/warrior or professional warriors. Where was some say <br/>
that samurai covers all those groups, but bushi were a subsection of <br/>
the overall group of those who gave military service. So often the use <br/>
of exactly which term for who seems to largely be personal preferance. <br/>
This also gets a bit more complicated when one considers that in the <br/>
medieval period a large number of even fairly professional warriors <br/>
would often participate in some kind of farming themselves even if <br/>
their main occupation was military service.</div>
