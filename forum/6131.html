<h3>An introduction</h3>
by <i>yeomanforbes</i>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-867734183">Greetings all.<br/>
<br/>
I joined this list at the behest of a friend, and noted a few things.<br/>
<br/>
1.  I don't know much about the period.  "Why," then, you ask, "are <br/>
you on here?"  I suppose I'll learn a lot by reading the posts, eh?  <br/>
That's also why I won't be saying much, since at this time, I have <br/>
nothing to draw from to speak.  Wait, I saw a movie with Tom Cruise <br/>
in it... it was called, I think, "Top Gun."  Samurai use F14s... <br/>
no, 'fraid I'm wrong.  It was a different movie, where he was on an <br/>
island... ah, "Far and Away."  No.  Wait.  I'll get it.  Was it <br/>
called "The Last Scientologist"? (Yes, I know, you're all grinding <br/>
your teeth... in unison... It's like when people think that Kate <br/>
Blanchet in "Elizabeth" was a good representation of history for <br/>
Tudor England.  And Ninjaburger.com is the end-all for learning the <br/>
history of the Ninja, you know.  [See #3 below.])<br/>
<br/>
2.  You lot are prolific (that is, for you aspiring elementary <br/>
teachers: "pro·lif·ic (pr-lfk) adj.  Producing abundant works or <br/>
results: a prolific artist. See Synonyms at fertile."--<br/>
Dictionary.com).  Notwithstanding the literary achievements of <br/>
various aspiring elementary teachers and their ilk (look at all them <br/>
there nickel words!), it appears it's going to take me a month or <br/>
two to wade through the sheer mass of posts.  I am assuming that <br/>
because the forum is moderated, the ratio of dross to content will <br/>
be very low, and that much of the content is going to be quite <br/>
specific, rather than broad generalizations that we should all know <br/>
because we read a book once in school.  (This, of course, does not <br/>
even come close to applying to those of you who have WRITTEN the <br/>
books, rather than just read them.)<br/>
<br/>
3.  Ninjaburger.com?  Even my pet, who has no opposable thumbs, and <br/>
can barely remember or perceive beyond eat/excrete/sleep, knows this <br/>
is a joke site.  Then again, people believe that there are infected <br/>
AIDS needles hidden in gas pump handles and that there's a Nigerian <br/>
who is going to give them a couple million dollars for one bank <br/>
transaction...<br/>
<br/>
Q.  No, I don't study any martial arts (though I'm familiar with, <br/>
but not a practitioner, of the fruits of that old bigamist, Mr. <br/>
Okazaki, known as Jujitsu).  <br/>
<br/>
5.  No, I'm not doing a report on Samurai for school and need you <br/>
all to do my research for me.<br/>
<br/>
6.  No, I'm not doing a website on Samurai and need you all to do my <br/>
research for me.<br/>
<br/>
7.  No, I'm not in the military, either, but kudos and thank you to <br/>
those of you who are now serving.<br/>
<br/>
8.  No, I'm not in the S.C.A. <br/>
<br/>
9.  Samurai is spelled with a "u," not an "a."  Samurai is spelled <br/>
with a "u," not an "a."  Samurai is spelled with a "u," not an "a." <br/>
(Thank you MS Word spellchecker.)  This should be good enough to <br/>
keep Mr. Ledbetter mollified... but if I slip and spell it with <br/>
an "a," may I get a "Get Out of Spelling Jail Free" card, please?<br/>
<br/>
I look forward to learning about the period.  I'm sure I'll run into <br/>
a good reading list somewhere on a recommended website and will be <br/>
able to locate the most common texts at my local library (the Los <br/>
Angeles County Central Library... which has an impressive amount of <br/>
books, to be sure.  Most of them are not relevant).  In fact, my <br/>
search method will probably be to start in the Japanese history <br/>
section and see what's there, start broad, and then narrow it down <br/>
as I familiarize myself with who the players are in the history.  <br/>
<br/>
Cheers.<br/>

Wait, I saw a movie<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Now, now, you know what they say about assuming. Makes<br/>
a donkey out of you and Ming. And the Ming don't like<br/>
that. <br/>
<br/>
Some things are quite specific. Some things are very<br/>
general. And more things than should probably get let<br/>
in, including inside jokes. I'm trying to cut down on<br/>
those, but sometimes I just can't help it.<br/>

true, he'd believe it. <br/>

 </span></blockquote>Hmm...incorrectly spelling the main topic of this list<br/>
IS a heinous offense, being as you can just look at<br/>
the email address and get it right. However, minor<br/>
mistakes are acceptable--nobody is perfect. The issue<br/>
is wilfull abuse of spelling, punctuation, and<br/>
grammar. If you slip and type "samarai" once, that's<br/>
fine. If over the course of 5 emails you spell it that<br/>
way 25 times, we have a problem. <br/>
<br/>
  I'm<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> > sure I'll run into <br/>

 </span></blockquote>www.samuraiarchives.com has a great list. Start there.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Dear Ming (can I call you Ming?):<br/>
Yes, indeed, it was sardonic humor.  If you can't mock badly <br/>
compiled history, what can you mock? <br/>
<br/>
Come to think of it, in answer to that question, there's lots of <br/>
things, including runway fashions for any year, teenagers with an <br/>
uncertain grasp of their native(!) language, Blue-state/Red-state <br/>
arguments, and why the music industry really thinks a few thousand <br/>
measly lawsuits are going to reverse the tide of a badly thought-out <br/>
campaign of consistently overpricing music CDs and hoping that .<br/>
<br/>
But I digress.<br/>
<br/>
I see, then, that I'd best read warily when sitting down with any of <br/>
the main authors.  I will also view the webpage you have suggested, <br/>
as I am sure it will probably answer innumerable questions I have, <br/>
such as "reading is so boring... is there a video I can watch to get <br/>
all this information in a two hour or less setting? Without <br/>
subtitles in English?"  <br/>
<br/>
I'm kidding about that last.<br/>
<br/>
I'll let everyone get back to researching some stranger's research <br/>
paper. ;D<br/>

for a laugh, though. <br/>

English. Though unless you speak Japanese, the<br/>
subtitles in English would be beneficial :)<br/>

<h3>Simply, OT: THE Ming Dynasty, was Re: An introduction</h3>
by <i>yeomanforbes</i>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1659413481">Dear Mr. The Ming Dynasty:<br/>
<br/>
First, my apologies.  I find it curious that, assuming you are a <br/>
Chinese emperor, you are so insistent upon using an article.  If <br/>
anything, most Chinese who are not native speakers of English tend <br/>
to omit articles, flinging them on the ash heap of lingual <br/>
misunderstanding (as I am sure that English speakers similarly <br/>
butcher Chinese, or Japanese).  But, because of your exalted <br/>
position, I will endeavor to not become too familiar and slip and <br/>
use your first name, "The."  <br/>
<br/>
Perhaps I was misunderstood: I meant, a movie treating the subject <br/>
that was less than two hours, in English, not subtitled.  You know, <br/>
the way a serious researcher would go about things.  (I seriously <br/>
doubt there's anything out there.)<br/>
<br/>
Which would drag me to the OT subject of THE Ming Dynasty, and the <br/>
thing that has me curious as to its meaning and why in the world the <br/>
Mings were so short-sighted that they completely failed to <br/>
understand and utilize trade:<br/>
<br/>
"Although merchants and trade in general were looked down upon, <br/>
China had established sea routes that were used for trade with Japan <br/>
and south Asia. Starting in 1405 A.D., Zheng He began a series of <br/>
seven naval expeditions that went as far as the east coast of <br/>
Africa. These trips followed established routes and were mainly <br/>
diplomatic. The last of these voyages was completed in 1433 A.D. At <br/>
this point, China was far ahead of the rest of the world in naval <br/>
capabilities. Their ships could carry as many as 500 men. However, <br/>
after the last voyage was completed none were ever again attempted. <br/>
In fact, records of the trips were destroyed and shipbuilding was <br/>
restricted to small-size vessels. As a result, China's coast was <br/>
frequently attacked by pirates."  -- <br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.mnsu.edu/emuseum/prehistory/china/later_imperial_china/min">http://www.mnsu.edu/emuseum/prehistory/china/later_imperial_china/min</a><br/>
g.html<br/>
<br/>
Now, paint me with purple dog excrement sideways, but doesn't that <br/>
seem to be a bit, well, insular?  And, even more to the point, <br/>
foolish?  Bah, peasants, always thinking of peasant things, and not <br/>
thinking of the big picture.  I think they managed to screw things <br/>
up pretty royally, so to speak.<br/>
<br/>
I'm going to extrapolate that the end of the Ming Dynasty's ability <br/>
to extend themselves through naval power probably coincided with a <br/>
rise in Japanese fortunes?  Any evidence to this effect in Japanese <br/>
history, from 1433-1470 or so?<br/>
<br/>
My apologies for dragging the discussion into the neighbor state and <br/>
outside the confines of the Samurai ("u", not "a"), but I suspect <br/>
this group will probably have some insight into this particular <br/>
event in history, even if colored by a heavy emphasis on the <br/>
Japanese history of the time.<br/>
<br/>
Ah, but this isn't researching papers for the youth of America (or <br/>
anywhere else).  As a side note, I recall a webpage with an idea oft-<br/>
duplicated which presented history ALMOST as it was, but with a few <br/>
facts twisted around so that anyone who failed to read the <br/>
introduction at the top ended up with something that would probably <br/>
get them an "F" on their paper.  It would have things like, "Abraham <br/>
Lincoln freed the slaves, then invented the microwavable burrito <br/>
with hot sauce, but not too hot because the newly freed slaves had <br/>
sensitive stomachs."  And it serves the little bastards right, since <br/>
I had to go to a brick and mortar library to look things up, and so <br/>
should they if they want to get credit for doing some work.  Er, <br/>
excuse me, was I musing out loud again?  <br/>
<br/>
I'm off to lunch, and to start Ch. 1 of Mr. Turnbull's "Samurai, a <br/>
Military History."  Wish me luck.<br/>

Yes, indeed, it was sardonic humor.  If you can't mock badly <br/>
compiled history, what can you mock? <br/>
<br/>
Come to think of it, in answer to that question, there's lots of <br/>
things, including runway fashions for any year, teenagers with an <br/>
uncertain grasp of their native(!) language, Blue-state/Red-state <br/>
arguments, and why the music industry really thinks a few thousand <br/>
measly lawsuits are going to reverse the tide of a badly thought-out <br/>
campaign of consistently overpricing music CDs and hoping that .<br/>
<br/>
But I digress.<br/>
<br/>
I see, then, that I'd best read warily when sitting down with any of <br/>
the main authors.  I will also view the webpage you have suggested, <br/>
as I am sure it will probably answer innumerable questions I have, <br/>
such as "reading is so boring... is there a video I can watch to get <br/>
all this information in a two hour or less setting? Without <br/>
subtitles in English?"  <br/>
<br/>
I'm kidding about that last.<br/>
<br/>
I'll let everyone get back to researching some stranger's research <br/>
paper. ;D<br/>

Subject: [samuraihistory] Simply, OT: THE Ming Dynasty, was Re: An<br/>
introduction<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Dear Mr. The Ming Dynasty:<br/>
<br/>
First, my apologies.  I find it curious that, assuming you are a<br/>
Chinese emperor, you are so insistent upon using an article.  If<br/>
anything, most Chinese who are not native speakers of English tend<br/>
to omit articles, flinging them on the ash heap of lingual<br/>
misunderstanding (as I am sure that English speakers similarly<br/>
butcher Chinese, or Japanese).  But, because of your exalted<br/>
position, I will endeavor to not become too familiar and slip and<br/>
use your first name, "The."<br/>
<br/>
Perhaps I was misunderstood: I meant, a movie treating the subject<br/>
that was less than two hours, in English, not subtitled.  You know,<br/>
the way a serious researcher would go about things.  (I seriously<br/>
doubt there's anything out there.)<br/>
<br/>
Which would drag me to the OT subject of THE Ming Dynasty, and the<br/>
thing that has me curious as to its meaning and why in the world the<br/>
Mings were so short-sighted that they completely failed to<br/>
understand and utilize trade:<br/>
<br/>
"Although merchants and trade in general were looked down upon,<br/>
China had established sea routes that were used for trade with Japan<br/>
and south Asia. Starting in 1405 A.D., Zheng He began a series of<br/>
seven naval expeditions that went as far as the east coast of<br/>
Africa. These trips followed established routes and were mainly<br/>
diplomatic. The last of these voyages was completed in 1433 A.D. At<br/>
this point, China was far ahead of the rest of the world in naval<br/>
capabilities. Their ships could carry as many as 500 men. However,<br/>
after the last voyage was completed none were ever again attempted.<br/>
In fact, records of the trips were destroyed and shipbuilding was<br/>
restricted to small-size vessels. As a result, China's coast was<br/>
frequently attacked by pirates."  --<br/>

g.html<br/>
<br/>
Now, paint me with purple dog excrement sideways, but doesn't that<br/>
seem to be a bit, well, insular?  And, even more to the point,<br/>
foolish?  Bah, peasants, always thinking of peasant things, and not<br/>
thinking of the big picture.  I think they managed to screw things<br/>
up pretty royally, so to speak.<br/>
<br/>
I'm going to extrapolate that the end of the Ming Dynasty's ability<br/>
to extend themselves through naval power probably coincided with a<br/>
rise in Japanese fortunes?  Any evidence to this effect in Japanese<br/>
history, from 1433-1470 or so?<br/>
<br/>
My apologies for dragging the discussion into the neighbor state and<br/>
outside the confines of the Samurai ("u", not "a"), but I suspect<br/>
this group will probably have some insight into this particular<br/>
event in history, even if colored by a heavy emphasis on the<br/>
Japanese history of the time.<br/>
<br/>
Ah, but this isn't researching papers for the youth of America (or<br/>
anywhere else).  As a side note, I recall a webpage with an idea oft-<br/>
duplicated which presented history. ALMOST as it was, but with a few<br/>
facts twisted around so that anyone who failed to read the<br/>
introduction at the top ended up with something that would probably<br/>
get them an "F" on their paper.  It would have things like, "Abraham<br/>
Lincoln freed the slaves, then invented the microwavable burrito<br/>
with hot sauce, but not too hot because the newly freed slaves had<br/>
sensitive stomachs."  And it serves the little bastards right, since<br/>
I had to go to a brick and mortar library to look things up, and so<br/>
should they if they want to get credit for doing some work.  Er,<br/>
excuse me, was I musing out loud again?<br/>
<br/>
I'm off to lunch, and to start Ch. 1 of Mr. Turnbull's "Samurai, a<br/>
Military History."  Wish me luck.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Check out Turnbull's "The Lone Samurai and the Martial<br/>
Arts". That will be a good base to start looking.<br/>
Names like Tsukuhara Bokuden, Kamiizumi Nobutsuna, and<br/>
Miyamoto Musashi are all covered--these are the real<br/>
sword masters who went on traveling "musha-shugyou"<br/>
pilgrimages, traveling to different places to practice<br/>
and learn their techniques. Much of the fictional<br/>
"ronin" literature started with their reality. <br/>
<br/>
And you spelled "preferably" correctly--good job! <br/>

There are several documentaries out there, but I<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Nope. Japan and China never competed directly in the<br/>
open seas, precisely because neither of them cared to.<br/>
The concept didn't ever really occur to the Japanese,<br/>
at least not until the Portuguese came around. Ieyasu<br/>
toyed with ships, but nothing more. China's decision<br/>
was an internal political decision--several ministers<br/>
were upset at the growing power of the eunuchs in the<br/>
Imperial regime. One of the most powerful and famous<br/>
eunuchs happened to be the Admiral who led all the<br/>
Emperor's sea expeditions. In their effort to curb the<br/>
Eunuchs' power, they convinced the Emperor to forbid<br/>
sea expeditions. Sounds horribly short sighted, but,<br/>
well, it was. <br/>

<br/>
 Er, <br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> > excuse me, was I musing out loud again?  <br/>

wonderful reading :)<br/>
