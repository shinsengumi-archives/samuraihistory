 </span></blockquote>It's "Chikara". And he committed seppuku along with the rest of them, I'm<br/>
afraid. (Actually, including Chikara, there were 46.)<br/>

I understand that OISHI SHIKARA YOSHIKANE was the youngest of the  <br/>
famous 47 Ronin. I've also found references to him being 'spared'  <br/>
from the ritual suicide punishment passed on the other 46 members of  <br/>
his clan. Assuming this is all correct, does anyone know what  <br/>
happened to him? Did he die a natural death, in battle etc.<br/>
