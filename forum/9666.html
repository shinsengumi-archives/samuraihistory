<h3>Horses in Japan</h3>
by <i>scott_rekishika</i>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-933944314">Horses had been in Japan since well before the Mongol invasions. <br/>
However, I believe the evidence shows that they were not native to <br/>
Japan. I can't remember off the top of my head when horses were <br/>
introduced to Japan though. I believe that they are in some of the <br/>
earliest chronicles about Japan from China though. And I think those <br/>
date from the 3rd century CE or so. But bones seem to indicate that <br/>
even though they were there a long time ago they were originally <br/>
brought from the contiinent.</div>
