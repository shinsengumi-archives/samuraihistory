<div id="ygrps-yiv-1089045976">A Muramasa  and a Masamune were stuck into the sand of a river bottom<br/>
<br/>
A leaf was floated down the stream and the Muramasa blade, known for <br/>
it's sharpness and bloodthirsty nature effortlessly cut the  leaf.<br/>
<br/>
Another leaf was floated down but this time the Masamune blade, full <br/>
of the good and honest spirit of the master swordsmith, did not cut <br/>
the leaf instead letting it pass unharmed...<br/>
