<h3>Graduate research project: Seppuku</h3>
by <i>jpellgen</i>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-235277086">Good afternoon everyone... I am a graduate school student at<br/>
California State University (CSUDH). My graduate research/thesis is on<br/>
the topic of seppuku. I did about 2 years of research on the topic<br/>
both here and in Japan. However, my advisor really doesnt like my<br/>
ideas. I need something more ground-breaking to really make this a<br/>
good project. It is a difficult subject to develope new ideas around.<br/>
I am moving back to Japan in March, so it would be nice to get some<br/>
momentum before I leave. I am just wondering if anyone has any<br/>
innovative ideas on this topic. My   original plan was to show that<br/>
the spirit of bushido is embodied in the practice of seppuku even to<br/>
modern times (ex. Yukio Mishima). <br/>
<br/>
Thanks for reading and God Bless.<br/>

  Perhaps if you approached it as the changing reasoning behind seppuku <br/>
reflecting the changing cultural emphasis in Japan. As I'm sure you know, <br/>
its origins in general weren't shame at failing rather " save us the trouble <br/>
and you will die bushi AND we won't kill your family" .<br/>
