<h3>Nobunaga, Hideyoshi and Ieyasu</h3>
by <i>tokualyon</i>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1731148700">Hello,<br/>
This may be an odd question but between Nobunaga, Hideyoshi and Ieyasu,<br/>
who would you consider the better daimyo and why? This may include<br/>
genius in warefare, administration or simply how successful they were. <br/>
I know Ieyasu was the eventual unifier of Japan but is that simply<br/>
because of his superiority over the other two leaders or because of<br/>
their unfortunate circumstances, i.e. Nobunaga dying untimely at the<br/>
hands of his vassal and Hideyoshi having no family name or title able to<br/>
be passed on etc? Likewise how much was Ieyasu's success in creating the<br/>
Tokugawa Shogunate owed to the previous two sengoku jidai leaders?<br/>

       Just personal opinion, but without Nobunaga, the whole thing would <br/>

his death prevented HIM from being the one to complete the mission.  <br/>
Hideyoshi, the one to actually UNIFY Japan, had an heir (Hideyori, Nobunaga's <br/>
grandnephew) but the people who succeeded him ultimately were too weak to be "regents" <br/>
until that child came of age.  But his disarming of  the people helped <br/>
solidify his hold on things.  (Was Hideyoshi the one to disarm the people?)  So <br/>
unified Japan was in place when Tokugawa was name Shogun in 1603.  However, I <br/>
don't think necessarily it was a case of Ieyasu being in the right place at the <br/>
right time.  From what I've read here on the list and elsewhere, it was a matter <br/>
of time before Ieyasu challenged Hideyoshi and took command of things, <br/>
especially after Sekigahara in 1600, which, to my mind, "sealed the deal" as it <br/>
were.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Agreed.<br/>
Nobunaga was the man. Hideyoshi was a great general, but his <br/>
country-bumpkin nature came out and he became a megalomaniac (=failure <br/>
in Korea... or was it China??), Ieyasu was an intelligent man but had <br/>
it 'relatively' easy.<br/>
<br/>
One thing about Nobunaga that people do not discuss much: a few years <br/>
before being killed, he had adopted an Imperial Prince... who knows <br/>
what he was planning...<br/>

 </span></blockquote>I disagree. Nobunaga was a fearsome man, but he lacked Hideyoshi's<br/>
governing ability, which in my opinion makes Hideyoshi the greater of<br/>
the three. If Nobunaga had not been murdered, I don't think the<br/>
unification would have gone nearly as smoothly. Nobunaga rubbed people<br/>
the wrong way, and out of fear I think you would have seen the powerful<br/>
clans rise against him in an effort to protect their autonomy, as<br/>
Nobunaga showed that he expected all the land to be directly under the<br/>
control of himself and his close retainers.<br/>
<br/>
Hideyoshi on the other hand knew that the way to govern in the 16th<br/>
century was not to destroy everybody in your way, but to reward and<br/>
garauntee the lands of the powerful daimyo. Sure, the memory of<br/>
Nobunaga's ruthless actions earlier in the 16th century probably gave<br/>
the daimyo a reason to want peace, but still...<br/>
<br/>
The marks against Hideyoshi were the two attempted invasions of Korea<br/>
and the fact that he did not have a realistic succession plan, thanks to<br/>
the forced suicide of his previous heir, who from the sounds of things,<br/>
may have deserved it... It's hard to forgive the Korean invasion, but if<br/>
he had lived for awhile longer we may not have seen a Sekigahara, and<br/>
perhaps a Toyotomi Bakufu?<br/>

 </span></blockquote>There's been mention of the fact that without Nobunaga, the <br/>
unification would not have gained the momentum that it had but there <br/>
were certainly other daimyo who had the power base to achieve it. <br/>
Ieyasu had two options - the Oda to his west and the Takeda to his <br/>
east, and had previously come to an understanding with Shingen. If <br/>
Nobunaga hadn't happened, he may well have sided with the Takeda, <br/>
and what odds on a Shingen/Ieyasu alliance unifying Japan? Of <br/>
course, the same scenario may have played out after Shingen's death <br/>
with Katsuyori in place of Hideyori.<br/>
<br/>
Hideyoshi's failing seems to have been that of a cult of <br/>
personality - a great deal of the loyalty that he acquired was to <br/>
himself personally rather than to his family, which unravelled with <br/>
surprising quickness after his death (helped in no small way by <br/>
Mitsunari's incompetance).<br/>
<br/>
There's one outsider I sometimes speculate on - the Shimazu. They <br/>
achieved the conquest of Kyushu, but didn't have enough time to <br/>
consolidate their victories. They were well served by loyal <br/>
retainers, and in Yoshihisa, Yoshihiro and Iehisa had some of the <br/>
finest generals of the time. The previous shogunate had been built <br/>
on a Kyushu power base, so if the Shimazu had been able to <br/>
consolidate their gains, could they have been the ones to unify <br/>
Japan?</div>

<br/>
I've always been quite frustrated by the fact that Hideyoshi had so many<br/>
obvious talents that did not pass onto his heir. I mean look at Hideyori...<br/>
he was spoiled his whole life! Hideyoshi, on the other hand, had nothing<br/>
when he started out and had no choice but to use his cunning and charisma to<br/>
gain his fame and fortune. Hideyori had it all to begin with, and doting<br/>
parents to boot. Maybe if he had started out in more abject circumstances he<br/>
may have developed some true leadership abilities. He lived too much of a<br/>
protected life, I think.<br/>
<br/>
There's also the fact One, Hideyoshi's wife, was unable to bear children.<br/>
Okay fine, the Taiko ended up sleeping around a lot, but if One was even<br/>
half as fertile as Maeda Toshiie's wife... *chuckles* In any case, one of<br/>
the biggest failings of inheriting power by blood is that talent doesn't<br/>
necessarily pass on through genes.<br/>
<br/>
The Korean invasion was a horrible idea, I agree. The Japanese history<br/>
volumes by (forgot first name) Samson -- they're a three volume set that<br/>
people here have recommended before as a good summary and starting point for<br/>
research -- speculate that Hideyoshi may have gone mad as he aged, maybe due<br/>
to a degenerative disorder of the brain. Of course, I'm not ruling out that<br/>
he was just plain drunk on his successes and figured, "Hey, if it worked<br/>
with Japan, it's got to work with mainland China!" *snorts*<br/>
<br/>
I guess I'm just a bit biased towards Hideyoshi myself because, out of all<br/>
the figures of Japanese history, his story has always been the most<br/>
awe-inspiring to me personally. In my opinion, only an exceptional<br/>
individual could have transcended his class and rise up to become the<br/>
de-facto ruler of all Japan, even if that rule never continued past his<br/>
generation.<br/>
