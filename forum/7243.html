<h3>Top knots and haircuts</h3>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1272517864">Thanks everyone on the help for the book.<br/>
<br/>
I have another questions, as I understand it, the coming of age<br/>
ceremony involves the shaving the forehead-top of the head for the<br/>
Samurai, do I have this correct or incorrect.<br/>
<br/>
Also what is the significance of the top of the head shaved or not,<br/>
Does this mean obedience to a particular lord?<br/>
<br/>
Thanks in advance<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Possibly, but not necessarily. Plenty of samurai did<br/>
not shave the forehead. This became a little more<br/>
formalized in the Edo period, but it was never a<br/>
"requirement" that the forehead be shaved. <br/>
<br/>
 Also what is the significance of the top of the head<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> > shaved or not,<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>It was a hairstyle, nothing more. Shaving the<br/>
forelocks was a mark of an adult samurai, but not<br/>
shaving it didn't mean the person wasn't samurai, and<br/>
in the Edo period the lower classes also shaved their<br/>
forelocks, but arranged the hair differently (check<br/>
out old episodes of Abarenbou Shogun to see this). <br/>
Having it shaved didn't mean you were a retainer of<br/>
Lord X--it wasn;t like wearing a unit patch on your<br/>
shoulder. <br/>
<br/>
Turnbull's 'Samurai Sourcebook' I believe has a<br/>
section on hairstyles with a good explanation. <br/>
<br/>
Nice to see another tanker on the board--I was a 12A<br/>
until they made me go MI. If you ain't cav...<br/>
