<h3>Saigo Takamori Videos</h3>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-2101362486">The NHK production Tobu ga Gotoku is available from NHK for a very pricey 27,700 yen for a four cassettes. the hompage is <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.amuse-soft.co.jp/">http://www.amuse-soft.co.jp/</a> . This again is the condensed version 49 episodes into 7 and a half hours. Taharazaka was done by VAP video company. I'm not sure where it might be available if it still is but I think it was as expensive as the other one. These videos plus many others are available for rent in most big Japanese video stores like Tsutaya. <br/>
