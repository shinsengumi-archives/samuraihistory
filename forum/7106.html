<h3>New Documentary</h3>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1511423293">If you all are so strongly against this documentary,  then<br/>
1. Don't buy/pay for it! If you know it's all lies, and you think that<br/>
this Hayes should not be earning money from this, then don't give him your<br/>
money.<br/>
2. Encourage people not to see this documentary. But, do not simply tell<br/>
them "It's all lies....Hayes is a fraud" because they will not take so<br/>
seriously an extreme point of view as a more moderate one.<br/>
3. Create your own documentary. If you want this documentary to not be<br/>
taken seriously and you want people to know the correct information, then<br/>
create a documentary with the correct information. Talking among ourselves<br/>
about how much of a fraud Hayes is does not solve the problem that this<br/>
documentary is out there and spreading inferior information.<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>create your own documentary on ninja?, I apologize but it would be..<br/>
completely stupid. if anyone knows ANYTHING true on ninjas and understood<br/>
the philosophy of being one would never make a documentary on them if he<br/>
really understood anything about it. the way of ninja has nothing similar<br/>
to truth, and to know really what is ninja history and philosophy means<br/>
eventually become one and this is incompatible to the.. information<br/>
spreading of documentaries. <br/>
<br/>
and to all kids that wants to be ninjas to be 'cool' know that be a ninja<br/>
means tell to nobody, act normally, give completely NO clue being a ninja,<br/>
suicide if you give any slight clue (or kill anyone suspecting), laugh<br/>
heartely at people saying anything on ninja beliving firmly that ninjas<br/>
does NOT exist and are simply an invention of hyped childs, officially<br/>
derespect ninjas and anything related, and finally do NOT do anything<br/>
ninja-like in public for any reason or purpose, and repeating to yourself<br/>
100 times per day at the mirror 'ninja doesn't exist they are fraud and<br/>
they aren't cool, they suck'. if you meet all this you made the first step<br/>
of be a ninja :P<br/>
<br/>
second step is talk of ninjas ever again!<br/>
<br/>
trird step... nothing because of course ninja doesn't exist :)<br/>
