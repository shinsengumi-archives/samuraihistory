<div id="ygrps-yiv-1064863100">Hi Everyone!<br/>
I am new to the group and very interested in Japanese Armor.  I live in<br/>
Dallas, Texas and work for The Crow Collection of Asian Art.  We are having<br/>
an Armor exhibition opening on March 21st.<br/>
I work in the Education Department for the museum.  As a result I am helping<br/>
to develop a lesson plan for teachers and students and also putting together<br/>
background information for the tour guides.  I do have some information, but<br/>
am very interested in learning more.  One of the perks of my job is getting<br/>
to see some of the exhibits before they go on display.  I am blown away by<br/>
the armor and masks. This stuff is sooo amazing and cool.  I can't wait to<br/>
see the public's reaction.  The reason I am writing this is to hopefully get<br/>
information from those with more knowledge on this subject matter.  In<br/>
addition to the Samurai Archives on the web, I was wondering if anyone might<br/>
have suggestions for more information (i.e. websites, books, movies, etc).<br/>
I am also looking for pertinent information that might be especially<br/>
interesting to children.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks so much!  I look forward to being a part of this group!!<br/>
<br/>
Warm regards,<br/>
