Looks like you're not getting much in the way of reply (though <br/>
Paul's suggestion to look into Morishige Ryuu or Morishige style <br/>
for a certain type of research).<br/>
<br/>
Would you be able to provide a little bitmore in the way of <br/>
context? What, exactly, are you looking for? The history of <br/>
houjutsu? A place to learn and practice? Historical episodes where <br/>
guns were used? Etc.<br/>
<br/>
If Japanese is acceptable to you, there is plenty of <br/>
information on the web. Have you looked at google or other <br/>
search engines? It looks like there is some information to be found in <br/>
English if you search 'hojutsu' (which is a technically incorrect and <br/>
possibly misleading transliteration) - but a few of the sites that I <br/>
glanced at appear to be a bit flakey.<br/>

I have come across a short sentence that dosent really go any further saying The inatomi school-seven secret techniques and methods that was it.<br/>

I'm also interested about what Wayne said.But I'm interested to find out the history and training neccesary to have a firearm(I'm reffering to the first matchlocks used in Japan,in the Sengoku).I'm also interested if you can give me some more info about the matchlocks Murakami used at the battle of Uedahara against Takeda SHingen(apart from the fact they were of Chinese manufacture).<br/>

<h3>Samurai Warfare during the 16th century</h3>
by <i>crazoftheages</i>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-823904415">To the Buke,<br/>
  After a certain amount of discussion with Takeda<br/>
Katsuchiyo, I've finished the writting of the paper on<br/>
Japanese warfare during Sengoku Jidai.  There was a<br/>
good deal learned on my part during the research of<br/>
the subject, enough to the point that I didn't include<br/>
nearly all of it for fear of making the paper too long<br/>
and droning.  However, this good deal learned are<br/>
things that Katsuchiyo-sama and myself are confident<br/>
that we can apply to our mok combat, and thereby<br/>
present a more accurate and realistic account of how<br/>
the Japanese actually fought in battle.  I hope that<br/>
anyone who chooses to read finds it at least somewhat<br/>
educating on a subject that I had a good deal of<br/>
difficulty researching myself: Very few documents I've<br/>
ever seen even begin to approach how battle formations<br/>
were structured and what their purpose was.<br/>
<br/>
Of course, I expect there to be mistakes.  The paper<br/>
was thrown together in haste, and numerouse accounts<br/>
of the same battles were referenced before deciding<br/>
which ones seemed the most realiable.  Anyone who'd<br/>
like to point anything out to me should feel free to<br/>
do so in the next couple of days before I leave for<br/>
the military.<br/>
<br/>
And on a final note, please forgive the lack of<br/>
references.  I plan on adding them before I leave so<br/>
that the paper might be able to be displayed without<br/>
any worries of plagarism charges, but for now I<br/>
thought I'd just represent it to the Society.  Enjoy.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
