<h3>Blade Company???</h3>
by <i>sjcarpediem</i>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-208780517">I'm thinking seriously about visiting Japan (for the first time) in January 04.  Mostly for a convention, but while I'm there I'd like to visit a sake plant and also a katana blade forge.  Here's where y'all come in...  A while ago I was reading about kendo and found out about this excellent company--Tokyo Blade Company or Japan Blade Company or something like that--that is supposed to be tops when it comes to manufacturing the multi-layer blades that made Samurai so famous, infamous, and generally reckoned.  Its also a rather large company and they offer tours of the forging premises by appointment and I'd like to find out more about that cuz it'd be very sad to miss a blade forge in Japan...  But I can't remember the name of the company and I haven't been able to find the page, again.<br/>
<br/>
Does this ring a bell w/anybody?  What is this company?  Do you know of any similar companies?<br/>
<br/>
Many thnx in advance.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Lord, of your grace all that I hope is this--<br/>
Keep the realm of my pleasure prosperous,<br/>
Avert from me the calamity of chastity,<br/>
And keep far from me the doom of repentance.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1088930864">Dear Stephanie:<br/>
     Hate to break this to you but all true "Samurai swords" were<br/>
produced in small shops. Usually consisting of the master and a few<br/>
students. A really large operation might also include a few flunkies. I<br/>
do not know of the place you seek but it may be in Taiwan or really just<br/>
some sort of modern knife factory. Someone on this group might be able to<br/>
direct you to someone that could get you in to see some modern<br/>
swordsmithing operation like Yoshindo Yoshihara in Tokyo. Or perhaps one<br/>
of the other toko working in the area. There are quite a few in the Tokyo<br/>
area. Do be sure to go to the Japanese sword museum or Nihonto<br/>
Hakobutsukan and the Tokyo National Museum while there. They are terrific<br/>
for viewing the best in japanese swords and art. Also a place called Aoi<br/>
art is right around the corner from the Sword museum it is a sword shop.<br/>
They have a web site www.aoi-art.ab.psiweb.com/index.html they are<br/>
retailers but may be able to arrange a tour for you.<br/>
     Hope you enjoy your trip. It is a great place to go.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>	Tom I would beg to differ, in the Mid to late-Muromachi there <br/>
werre very large operations at Osafune in Bizen and in Mino. Witness <br/>
the innurable smiths signing Sukesada, then imagine each as a group <br/>
of artists working together and you can get an idea of their numbers. <br/>
The work from these shops is known a Kazu-uchi-mono and while derided <br/>
by some as pedestrain work, they are still very much "true Samuari <br/>
swords".<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Today in Mino (Gifu) there are still many smiths cranking out blades <br/>
of all types for sale. Many of these shops are open to the public, <br/>
since they are still playing on the reputation of being a center of <br/>
sword production. Perhaps thru the TOZANDO website or NOSHYUIAIDO <br/>
you'll find links to these.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>If you travel to Kamakura on the "Backside" of Kamakura station is <br/>
the shop of the 24th generation Masamune swordsmith, Yamamura <br/>
Tsunahiro. Yamamura Sensei doesn't speak much English but welcomes <br/>
visitors. They always fire up the furnace on Sundays.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>The sword museum is closed mondays and holidays. Also check out the <br/>
Eisei Bunka (Hosokawa family collection), Nezu Bijutsukan, Seikado <br/>
bijutsukan and Sano Bijutsukan (in Mishima) for rotating exhibits of <br/>
swords.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1616634911">Dear Tom:<br/>
    I agree completely with your observations. I guess I do fall into<br/>
that camp that does not consider Kazu-uchi-mono true samurai swords from<br/>
the artistic sense. In my reply I took a rather narrow view for the sake<br/>
of brevity. Actually Yasukuni-to was very much a factory operation also.<br/>
I really considered these to be kind of historical anomalies. I loved the<br/>
suggestion of the Masamune decendant visit. I had forgotten about him.<br/>
The Sano is a wonderful place is'nt it.<br/>
     There are so many good places to visit. My personal favorite is to<br/>
visit a temple during a "flea market". I think Takahada Fudo on the third<br/>
Sunday of the month to be excellent. Oh well, this could go on forever. <br/>
Thanks Tom for stimulating my mind<br/>
