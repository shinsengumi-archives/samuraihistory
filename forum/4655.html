<h3>Japanese Ironclad</h3>
by <i>msr_iaidoka</i>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-941315925">Bill M.,<br/>
<br/>
  Considering that you are a major fan of Japanese naval warfare, especially <br/>
pre WWII, would I be able to assume that you have heard of the ironclad <br/>
HIJMS Azuma?  It was also called the Kotetsu when it was first acquired as a <br/>
Tokugawa ship.  I have been researching this ship for about a year now, <br/>
though not as well as I possibly could considering my lack of being about to <br/>
read Japanese (yet).  If you know anything about this ship please let me <br/>
know.  I would love to talk with you about it and swap notes.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Peace,<br/>
<br/>

<h3>RE: [samuraihistory] Japanese Ironclad</h3>

<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-187567229">Matt,<br/>
<br/>
Here is what I have, let me know if this is what you are looking for.<br/>
<br/>
HIJMS Azuma: (ex-Kotetsu, ex-Staerkodder, ex-Stonewall, ex-Sphinx)<br/>
<br/>
Builders: L'Arman Bros, Bordeaux<br/>
<br/>
Date: 1863-1865<br/>
<br/>
Disp: 1560 (F)- 1390 (N)<br/>
<br/>
Length: 194'9" overall- 183'7" at the waterline<br/>
<br/>
Beam: 31'6"<br/>
<br/>
Machineery: 2-screw horizontal direct-acting Mazeline engines, 2 Mazeline<br/>
boilers.<br/>
<br/>
SHP: 1300 ihp<br/>
<br/>
Speed: 9 knots<br/>
<br/>
Arm: 1x9in BL in bow casemate, 2x6.3in BL (Armstrong)<br/>
<br/>
Crew: 135<br/>
<br/>
General Notes:<br/>
An ironclad ram design by M. Arman, with a wooden hull and iron belt. The<br/>
propellers were unusual, with twin coupled rudders and two keels. This<br/>
unique arrangement was intended to give great maneuverability. Her sister<br/>
ship Cheops became the Prussian Prinz Adlbert.<br/>
<br/>
Armor: Belt 41/2" on the waterline, 51/2" on the CT, 4" casemate, and the<br/>
upper deck was also enclosed by armored bulwarks.<br/>
<br/>
Bought for the Shoguns fleet in 1867 and arrived in Yokohama 24 April 1868<br/>
with an American crew. She was later taken back into American ownership and<br/>
early in 1869 was handed over to the Emperor, with the new name Kotetsu (the<br/>
armored one); renamed Azuma in 1871 and rated a coast defense battleship;<br/>
stricken 28 January 1888, and served for a further period as an<br/>
accommodation ship.<br/>
<br/>
Cheers<br/>
Bill M.<br/>

  That is more than I had found thus far.  Especially the name <br/>
"Staerkodder."  Does that come from the attempt to sell it to Denmark?  I <br/>
was also unaware of the sister ship.  I have been having a hard time finding <br/>
information on this ship.  I can only assume it is because I do not now <br/>
where to look.  Woud you be so kind as to tell me where you found this out?  <br/>
My main source of information so far has been on the US Navy Military <br/>
History site.<br/>
  I have an account written by one of the Confederates who served on her <br/>
during the trans-Atlantic voyage from France to Cuba.  I will dig it up and <br/>
send it to you if you are interested.<br/>

  I have an account written by one of the Confederates who served on her<br/>
during the trans-Atlantic voyage from France to Cuba.  I will dig it up and<br/>
send it to you if you are interested."<br/>
<br/>
All the info was from "Warships of the Imperial Japanese Navy, 1869-1945" by<br/>
Hansgeorg Jentschura, Dieter Jung, and Peter Mickel. USNI Press 1992.<br/>
<br/>
More info: Ordered for the Confederate States' Navy as the Sphinx; launched<br/>
21 June 1864, completed 25 October 1864; bought by Denmark and renamed<br/>
Staerkodder, after being blockaded in Corunna by Federal warships Sacramento<br/>
and Niagara the sale was not completed, and she was renamed CSS Stonewall;<br/>
1865 surrendered to Federal forces after which she was bought for the<br/>
Shoguns fleet. You have the rest of the info from this point. A note of<br/>
interest is that in Conway's All the World's Fighting Ships they state that<br/>
the reason for the US retaking ownership from the Japanese after the initial<br/>
purchase was because the Japanese simply did not yet have the facilities to<br/>
take care of her nor enough experience to crew her. Once the Japanese were<br/>
ready they once again took possession and that is when she was renamed<br/>
Kotetsu.<br/>
<br/>
The other source for the above is Conway's All the World's Fighting Ships<br/>
1860-1905.<br/>
<br/>
If you want more details as to armament and type of armor manufacture just<br/>
let me know. Most you have already but there are some differences between<br/>
Conway's, Jane's and Warship's.<br/>
<br/>
Her sister the Prussian/German Prinz Adalbert: (Source-Conway's 1860-1905<br/>
German section)<br/>
<br/>
Dis: 1535 tons<br/>
Dim: 186' 8" overall, 165' 7" at the waterline, 32'6" beam, 16'6" draft.<br/>
Mach: 2-shaft HSE, 1200ihp=10kts.<br/>
Armor: Wrought iron, Belt 5", tower 4 ?".<br/>
Armament: 1-120mm, 2-170mm.<br/>
Crew: 130<br/>
<br/>
This ironclad ram originally known as Cheops, was under construction at<br/>
Bordeaux for the Confederacy, to her builders design, together with a sister<br/>
ship Stonewall Jackson, later the Japanese Azuma. She was purchased for the<br/>
Prussian Navy in June 1865, but not put into service until a year later. She<br/>
was not a particularly good bargain, being a bad seaboat, and the timbers of<br/>
her composite hull rapidly fell prey to rot. Though the Prussians replaced<br/>
her original intended armament of three 32pdrs with bigger guns in the<br/>
five-ported bow position and in the two-gun octagonal citadel abaft the<br/>
funnel, she could not be considered a particularly powerful ship. She was<br/>
schooner rigged. She was placed in reserve because of wood rot as early as<br/>
October 1871, and disarmed in 1875/6.<br/>
<br/>
Gee, it feels good to be able to actually answer something here on this<br/>
list! ;-)<br/>
<br/>
The first mentioned book is easily available while the older Conway's are a<br/>
little harder to find. If you are looking to get them let me know and I will<br/>
point you in the right direction.<br/>
<br/>

  I was under the impression that Denmark had rejected the purchase, which <br/>
allowed the Confederates to buy the ship via a loophole in the neutrality <br/>
agreement that France and England had going.  Mayhaps I am misunderstand <br/>
what was meant by rejecting the purchase.  Would I be logical then to assume <br/>
that Denmark took the ship, re-christened her, and then said, "Nope, not up <br/>
to our quality, take her back" as a means of adding legitimacy to the trick?<br/>
  When I get home from work I will send you the article that I have.  It is <br/>
a rather interesting first hand account.  I also have a dozen or so pictures <br/>
and etchings on my computer of the ship.  It is a particular favorite of <br/>
mine since it ties in two of my most favorite parts of history, the US War <br/>
Between the States and Tokugawa/Bakumatsu Japan.<br/>

<br/>
I don't know for sure, but this sounds very possible and well within the<br/>
realm of the kinds of dealings going on at the time. I checked the listings<br/>
for both Denmark and the United States in Conway's and found no listings for<br/>
her what so ever. This is one of the great things that interest me so in<br/>
nautical/naval history and in the samurai for that matter. I love when the<br/>
plot thickens. This has tweaked my interest and I will keep you posted as to<br/>
what I am able to uncover. Give me a few days as I have tons of material to<br/>
go through but I hope to turn up further information that will allow us to<br/>
nail this baby down.<br/>
