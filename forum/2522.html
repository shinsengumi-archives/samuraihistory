<div id="ygrps-yiv-1960981364">Welcome aboard to samurai history.  The best books as introduction are those <br/>
by our Anthony Bryant at Indiana University,  clearly written and factual.    <br/>
Dr. Turnbull has a high reputation in  the field, but I deem only so because, <br/>
until the advent of Tony B. he was the only one who wrote in the field in <br/>
English.  I have found Turnbull to be distressingly contradictory about the Battle <br/>
of Nagashino,  in that an important raid that Oda Nobunaga launched against <br/>
Takeda Katsuyori  Turnbull said in one book the raid was launched the night <br/>
before the battle.  In another book, he said it was the morning of the battle.  <br/>
Also,  his research on Japanese castle sieges seems way out of line with the <br/>
contemporary battle screens which depicted such sieges!  Therefore, go by Bryant <br/>
in your research,  and keep Turnbull for the supply train.  Regards,  Prof <br/>
Murphy<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-876941939">I think Paul Varley's "Warriors of Japan" and Wayne Ferris "Heavenly <br/>
Warriors" are two other crucial works. "Japan Before Tokugawa" (edited <br/>
by Hall) has a lot of great stuff as well. Of course, it all depends on <br/>
what aspect of the samurai history one is interested in.<br/>
