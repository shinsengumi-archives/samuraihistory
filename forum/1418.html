 </span></blockquote>Don't take this wrong, but... um....<br/>
<br/>
You're writing a book on Yoritomo and yet you're asking people whose<br/>
veracity and limit of knowledge is untestable to tell you about him? Aren't<br/>
you doing research?<br/>
<br/>
And, for the record, it is arguable that Yoritomo had little or nothing to<br/>
do with the shogunate as it eventually evolved. The Muromachi shogunate was<br/>
the product of Hojo engineering, and was a very different structural and<br/>
functional animal from the shogunate of the Tokugawa, for example.<br/>

<h3>Minamoto Yoritomo</h3>
by <i>andjoysmith</i>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-527332436">I think I have some information on Minamoto Yoritomo, that's when he<br/>
started the first shogunate, which was the foundation for other<br/>
shogunates, including the Tokugawa shogunate. Historians thought<br/>
Minamoto Yoritomo died in battle, but he didn't die in battle, he died<br/>
from injuries from a horsing accident in 1199. It would be great for<br/>
my book I'm writing, it's that I need to know what Minamoto Yoritomo's<br/>
childhood was like, that's all I need for my book.</div>
