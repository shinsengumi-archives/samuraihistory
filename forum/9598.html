<h3>2nd Fundraiser Auction for Journal: Sengoku Daimyo Manga</h3>
by <i>kitsuno</i>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-629068962">Although the first auction is still open, I have set up the second<br/>
fundraiser auction.  This is an auction for 3 Sengoku Daimyo related<br/>
manga - Oda Nobunaga, Hojo Soun, and Takeda Shingen.<br/>
<br/>
The Oda Nobunaga manga is the first issue of a series and is also a<br/>
first edition, in great condition.  Takeda Shingen is issue #5, and is<br/>
20 years old, but in good condition, with some signs of wear and age. <br/>
Hojo Soun is probably the most impressive (to me at least), it is a<br/>
stand-alone issue (and first edition), which covers Hojo Soun's life<br/>
from the Onin war onward.  It has great artwork, and is from the series<br/>
"Sengoku Busho Retsuden".<br/>
<br/>
All three are imported from Japan and in Japanese.  Here is the auction<br/>
URL for more info and for bidding:<br/>
