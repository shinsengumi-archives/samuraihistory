<div id="ygrps-yiv-1435157946">1. Nobunaga was wounded and committed suicide at the Honnoji temple of Kyoto on 21st june 1582 after a fight against Akechi Mitsuhide's troups. The temple was burned during the fight.<br/>
2.The reasons why Takeda Shingen pushed out his father Nobutora are not fully explained but it is believed that it was a combination of personal ambition, bearing in mind the relationship between father and son was not too good, and the growing insatisfaction of some major vassals who resented the high-handed manner of Nobutora in his direction of the clan.<br/>
