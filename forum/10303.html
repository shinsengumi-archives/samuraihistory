<br/>
In part two of our Nagashino podcast, we continue our discussion of the battle of Nagashino and the "Military Revolution" theory adopted by many Western historians including Delmer Brown and Geoffrey Parker. We also look at the primary and secondary sources for the battle of Nagashino, and look into the history of guns in Japan, and their importance in Japanese warfare of the time.<br/>

<h3>About origin of bushido</h3>
by <i>rodjuri</i>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1534806247">Grettings, mina san,<br/>
I'm working in an essay about bushido and I found myself in a problem, given that the raise of the bushido class is a progressive developmente through the Heian period reaching its mature form within the Kamakura period. Nevertheless formal and clear definitions about the way of the samurai, the seven principles and thing like that, are written in the Tokugawa period, several centuries after.Please, could you help me saying me if there is some code of samurai ways written in the kamakura period (or before), better if accepted and promoted by the bakufu, and what it says more or less? Thank you for your help.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>period, it seems to be very personal and individualized.  There was<br/>
definitely a culture of honor, or "face" in Japanese culture.  For example,<br/>
 Emp. Godaigo's spy justified his absence from court by intentionally and<br/>
publically making a mistake in reading a particular character.  That<br/>
humiliation gave him an excuse to retire from the court for about a year.<br/>
 Other bits can be gleaned from various war tales.<br/>
<br/>
We find evidence of people who dyed their hair black and perfumed it so that<br/>
when they died in battle their head would be presentable.  Suicide (though<br/>
not necessarily harakiri) is a common enough theme--though it is a last<br/>
resort.  Enduring pain and suffering with stoic fortitude are also common,<br/>
and look to the way Buddhist values--particularly of anti-materialism and<br/>
the concept of non-attachment--was idealized among this class.<br/>
<br/>
Of course, people could find all sorts of reasons to get around such<br/>
strictures.<br/>
<br/>
For direct evidence, you'll need to look to various house instructions<br/>
written by leaders to their followers and descendants.<br/>
<br/>
Also look to Karl Friday and others.<br/>

What have you read, so far?<br/>

<h3>Re: [samuraihistory] About origin of bushido</h3>

<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-2112332056">Thank you for your help.I had read some general sources, like, "History of Japan" by John Withney Hall, "The Crysanthemum and the Sword" (Benedict), "Japanese Society" (Nakane), and stuff like this. Never before I was in the  topic of bushido, my main interests in japanese history being the Sengoku jidai (the history of the houses involved), and the first half of XX century (economics mainly).Thanks again.<br/>

Also, ironically in about 3-4 weeks we'll be doing a podcast on the myth of Bushido, I've already gathered quite a few interesting incidents of Samurai behaving badly.<br/>
