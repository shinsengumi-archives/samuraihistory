<div id="ygrps-yiv-540185573">Hello,<br/>
<br/>
Let me introduce myself, my name is David and i live in the U.S. and <br/>
im very facinated by the samurai culture, along with many other <br/>
aspects of asian cutlure in general.  I can't say im overly <br/>
knowledgable in the history of the samurai but i did learn a little <br/>
bit in a history class i took last year, assuming the information was <br/>
correct.  Does anyone have any good reccomendations for reading <br/>
material, not only about the cutlure and history, but about the <br/>
aspects and philosphy's of weilding the sword?  Any information would <br/>
be great.  <br/>
<br/>
Thanks for yoru time.<br/>
<br/>
D.K.</div>
