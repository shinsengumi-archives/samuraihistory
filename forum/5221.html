<h3>Announcing Samurai History Papers</h3>
by <i>kitsuno</i>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-550457940">Ridgeback Press is pleased to announce the release of SAMURAI HISTORY <br/>
PAPERS, an innovative quarterly newsletter from Romulus Hillsborough <br/>
(author of RYOMA and SAMURAI SKETCHES). SHP will focus on the history <br/>
and culture of the great men of the Meiji Restoration.<br/>
<br/>
The Meiji Restoration was one of the most important events in Asian <br/>
history, and one of the greatest revolutions in the history of the <br/>
world. It centered around the overthrow of the Tokugawa Shogunate in <br/>
1868, and the restoration of political power to the emperor.<br/>
<br/>
Mid-19th-century Japan was a caldron of political upheaval and <br/>
intrigue, bloody inner-fighting among samurai, and the end of three <br/>
centuries of feudalism under shogunal rule. This most enthralling age <br/>
in the annals of Japan brought forth some of the most fascinating men <br/>
in that nation's history. These samurai modernized Japan. They also <br/>
laid the foundation for the militarism of WWII and the economic <br/>
powerhouse of today. Close scrutiny of these two-sworded men provides <br/>
insight into the political, cultural and psychological roots of <br/>
modern Japan. Just as the Meiji Restoration is considered "the dawn <br/>
of modern Japan," knowledge of this history is essential for <br/>
understanding how and why Japan has evolved into the nation that it <br/>
is today.<br/>
<br/>
Purpose of Samurai History Papers - the only serial publication in <br/>
English focusing on the history and culture of the great men of the <br/>
Meiji Restoration<br/>
<br/>
The Meiji Restoration has often been neglected and/or misrepresented <br/>
by writers of the English language. When this history has been <br/>
represented seriously and accurately, it has generally been in a dry <br/>
academic format. Since the publication of his first book, RYOMA Â­ Life <br/>
of a Renaissance Samurai, it has been the objective of Romulus <br/>
Hillsborough to present this most fascinating period in Japanese <br/>
history, and the humanity of the men who made this history, <br/>
accurately and realistically, in a vivid literary format which will <br/>
at once educate and entertain. Hillsborough continues this objective <br/>
in Samurai History Papers.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Targeted Readership<br/>
Enthusiasts of Japanese history and culture, military history <br/>
enthusiasts, students and teachers of these subjects, patrons of <br/>
public, university and high school libraries - and anyone interested <br/>
in history depicted as human drama.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
First Issue to Be Published: September 2004<br/>
<br/>
Frequency: Quarterly (delivered by email)<br/>
<br/>
Yearly subscription: $25<br/>
