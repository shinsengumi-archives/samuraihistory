<h3>relationships?</h3>
by <i>shinobij</i>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-539746509">I appolagise for asking what is probably a simple question with probably a well known answer but i am somewhat of a novice to the subject of samurai and just joined this group recently to aid me in my quest for more knowledge about feudal japan and samurai themselves. To the point: Where samurai allowed to have relationships, marriages etc.? I would appretiate any answers (as long as they are correct) along with any advisable books websites etc. ThankyouJonathan Lee (scotland)<br/>

<h3>Re: [samuraihistory] Aoyama family crest</h3>
by <i>rodjohnson001</i>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-118863829">Hi Coeli,<br/>
<br/>
There are many family crests (Mon) associated with the Aoyama. Of these I can readily identify five mon, the easiest to describe without a pic would be a circle with eight circles touching and surrounding it - a little like the Hosakawa. A further example would be a single coin (zeni); this is a circle with a small square cut out in the centre. To be a little more accurate you would need to identify the branch of the family or province in which they lived.<br/>
<br/>
I could get some scan of these off to you if you need them.<br/>
<br/>
Regards,<br/>
<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-2070650294">thanks, and if it wouldn't be too much of a trouble for you, i wouldn't mind getting those scanned mon. my book about the samurai by stephen turnbull doesn't have the complete mon of the samurai families, that's why i was asking for it.<br/>
