<h3>Greeting and Qeustion</h3>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1117642263">Hi I'm a new member to the talk group and I was woundering what is the main difference between the samurai and the knight class is.  Not the armor or the swords but the codes they took up.  Is chivalry and ,the later code, busido simalar or are they very different?  Those are the qeustions I were wondering and never got the the chance to research and find out about.  I would be most pleased if one of you answerd my question.  I have some information on samuraies but not a lot because of my limited resources. <br/>
