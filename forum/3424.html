<h3>Fuun Shinsengumi</h3>
by <i>jaso1670</i>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1568539855">I managed to get my hands on a PS2 video game that was recently released in Japan called Fuun Shinsengumi.<br/>
<br/>
The game is a semi-historical sim where you actually get to play a squad leader in the Shinsengumi during the Bakumatsu.<br/>
<br/>
It's very good and the realism level is pretty high (ie, no magical attacks or fantasy elements so far).<br/>
<br/>
While I'm missing out on a major part of the story as the text is entirely in Japanese, I have to say that I'm having one hell of a time going on patrols and participating in missions based on historical events.<br/>
<br/>
All the real life members of the Shinsengumi are there and so far I've sparred with Saitoh Hajime and gone on an assassination mission alongside of Souji (fast bugger, coughs a lot, stole my kill).<br/>
<br/>
OVerall I give the game a perfect score. The action is intense, excellent historical accuracy. Some of the best graphics I've seen in a PS2 game. Controls are easy and intuitive to learn as well. <br/>
<br/>
My only complaint is that it sometimes takes an unrealistic amount of cuts to kill someone, but I suppose they had to do that for game balance.<br/>
<br/>
ANyways, I hope they translate this game and bring it out stateside.<br/>
<br/>
It's A+ all around.<br/>

       Sounds like fun.  Am I correct in guessing it's sort of like the <br/>
Onimusha series WITHOUT the fantasy stuff?  And r u planning to get Onimusha 3 or <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1213802387">It's somewhat similar to the Onimusha series but the controls are much<br/>
deeper and you have a little more freedom.<br/>
<br/>
I will likely get the US version of Onimusha3<br/>

<h3>Re: [samuraihistory] Wonders of the Ancient World</h3>
by <i>soshuju</i>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1198823642">All-<br/>
	For more misconceptions about the Samurai, I can recommend "Wonders of <br/>
the Ancient World." The episode on Japan mind you haven't seen the <br/>
others.Which is currently running on public television here in the US. <br/>
It was produced in England, usually the home of the highest production <br/>
values, not unfortunately in this case. Along with pictures of <br/>
Hideyoshi shown during a discussion of the Fujiwara family, upside down <br/>
kanji (3X) and close ups of Plastic swords we learn AFTER Yoritomo <br/>
became the first Shogun, there arose a class of men dedicated to war; <br/>
the Samurai! I understand it is easy to be a critic and hard to cover <br/>
this subject in just one hour but this one had me jumping off the sofa <br/>
so many times I almost didn't sit at all. Check it...<br/>
