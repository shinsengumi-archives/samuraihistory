<h3>Imperial wives</h3>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1487828713">I was thinking about this in relation to Hideyoshi's elevation to <br/>
Kampaku and his family being raised to the level of an aristocratic <br/>
family on a par with the Fujiwara:<br/>
<br/>
Post-Hojo Shikkenate, are there many instances of Emperors' wives <br/>
coming from non-Fujiwara stock? I believe Imperial consorts were <br/>
*supposed* to have come from the Fujiwara or gosekke clans.</div>
