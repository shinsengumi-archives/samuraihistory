<div id="ygrps-yiv-1664122568">I'm confused. What does the Australian Sword ban accomplish exactly?<br/>
I know they have had a problem with hoards of roaming outlaw Samurai <br/>
and Ninja but I thought the f arms ban took care of that <br/>
problem.Seriously- will Australia repeat something like Bill Clintons <br/>
rape of the National Armoury here in the States? Many priceless <br/>
historical pieces were lost forever-perhaps Aus. sword collectors, <br/>
museums or who ever might be affected should get your collections to <br/>
safety.(Will museums be affected?) As for crossbows- don't go there- <br/>
I'm disabled and hunt with one.</div>
