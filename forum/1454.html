<h3>Hagakure Crest</h3>

<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1691710444">The symbol might mean nothing at all.  Plus that is the second cover <br/>
that I know of.  The other has a sword on it.  There could easily be <br/>
more covers considering how long it has been published, but those are <br/>
the 2 that I know of.  My history professor recently wrote a book on <br/>
Chinese histiry (cannot remember the exact topic), and the publishers <br/>
wanted to put a kanji on the cover that had nothing to do with the <br/>
subject of the book.  So they are not always related.  It might, but <br/>
it might not.. I dont know the symbol.  As far as books on wafare and <br/>
tactics THE ART OF WAR(or WARFARE) by Sun Tzu, and THE BOOK OF FIVE <br/>
RINGS by Miayamoto Musashi are given obvious choices.  If you have <br/>
not read these texts I would suggest you do.  I have yet to read it, <br/>
but I did order a new copy of THE ART OF WARFARE that includes <br/>
recently discovered chapters, a commentary, and the original <br/>
classical Chinese text so that if you can read it you can varify <br/>
things for yourself.  It is available on amazon.com for about $18 <br/>
US.  Hoping it gets delivered soon, can't wait to give it a read.</div>

 </span></blockquote>It looks like arrenged one, which is notexist as a Family crest.<br/>
<br/>
It might came from  "Plum flower and crane" motif, both plum<br/>
flower and crane are used as family crest. <br/>
However, the only one conbination I know is Ume-Tsuru,<br/>
you may see it on URL below.<br/>
