<h3>First Samurai</h3>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-503045264">Hi,<br/>
<br/>
I was in Suncoast Video on Monday 31 May 2004 and was browsing thru <br/>
when I chanced upon a three CD Box set titled, First Samuarai, the <br/>
actor in in is Tishiro Mifune.<br/>
<br/>
I was wondering if anybody else has seen this set and if so have they <br/>
purchased or reviewed it as I am considering it, I think it was about <br/>
$30.00.<br/>
<br/>
Any opinions?<br/>
<br/>
Thanks</div>
