<h3>on suicide...</h3>
by <i>spectresinthefog</i>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-71133499">hello again,<br/>
 <br/>
i was wondering if i could trouble you with a question or two concerning 'seppuku' and suicide in japan,preferably during the time the samurai class existed.<br/>
 <br/>
i had read on a website (unfortunately i cannot seem to find the link on google) about the samurai,that seppuku consisted of slicing open the belly because according to buddhist belief,the spirit resided in the belly area of the body.as i have little to none information on buddhist beliefs,i can't say whether what i read is true or not.supposing this is true,i remember a previous post concerning seppuku for women,where it said that women could commit seppuku by slashing their throats if i'm not mistaken(is this limited to only women of samurai families or women before the meiji restoration or neither?).considering all this,i want to ask if the difference is simply because of religious beliefs or perhaps out of conveniency?<br/>
 <br/>
and secondly,were there any other 'honourable' ways to commit suicide apart from slicing open the belly?<br/>

 </span></blockquote>I'm sure that you'll get plenty of messages that talk about the <br/>
mystical side of seppuku. So I won't add yet another.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> >considering all <br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>It is convenience, which of course may have been couched in mystical <br/>
terms. It's apparently quite difficult to pull off slicing one's <br/>
belly open (I haven't tried it myself), even for a man. So on average, <br/>
based on physical strength, it's that much more difficult for a <br/>
woman.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> >and secondly,were there any other 'honourable' ways to commit suicide apart <br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Just about all of them, depending on the circumstances.<br/>
<br/>
There are apparently cases of women doing seppuku historically - but <br/>
accepted wisdom is that they sliced their throat (or, more usually, <br/>
pierced their throat). <br/>
<br/>
Alternatively, there is a common idea that when faced with <br/>
certain death, women would essentially fall on their sword - put a <br/>
blade up to their chest and fall forwards, plunging it into their <br/>
hearts.<br/>
<br/>
Another common folk-truth is that women committed suicide in these <br/>
situations by biting off their tongues - though it's never been clear <br/>
to me exactly how this would lead to death, other than by slowly bleed<br/>
ing to death which could have been accomplished any other number of wa<br/>
ys.<br/>
<br/>
Women are also said to have hanged themselves (kubi-tsuri), drown <br/>
themselves (nyuu-sui), or jumped off of cliffs (tobi-ori).<br/>

  I did some extensive research on seppuku a little while ago, and the idea that slicing open the belly was symbolic of where the spirit resided is indeed true. The point was to reveal your "heart" and show that it was not black (meaning that you were honorable). And if I remember correctly, women opted to slit their throats rather than their bellies, simply because the act of seppuku was so utterly painful that a woman generally cannot tollerate the pain. Remeber, too, that this act is to be carried out without any emotion, or any sign of pain, or the act is all for naught. Taking this into consideration, and the fact that slitting your belly was a very slow death, women would choose the quicker, less painful method of suicide. <br/>
 <br/>
  I hope that answers it! There are a few great books that can also help you along in your research (as well as a few websites), and I'd be happy to give you a short bibliography if you'd like. Just let me know!<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Um, why? Being Japanese doesn't mean you're required<br/>
to commit seppuku. <br/>
<br/>
You're thinking of Mishima Yukio, the author. It<br/>
wasn't at a television station, it was at Ichigaya,<br/>
the then military academy, now the headquarters of the<br/>
Japan Defense Agency (think the Japanese Pentagon).<br/>
I've stood in the spot where he did the deed. It<br/>
wasn't simply a protest, it was a botched and horribly<br/>
failed attempt to get the students to rise up in a<br/>
coup--they laughed at him, and he withdrew to attempt<br/>
his fairly botched suicide.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>First, it's "hara-kiri." Second, no. "Hara-kiri" is the Japanese reading of the <br/>
kanji (with them reversed to approximate Japanese word order, with the verb -- <br/>
kiru, to cut -- after the object); the Chinese reading of the kanji -- in the <br/>
Chinese order -- is seppuku.<br/>
<br/>
Seppuku is considered a more genteel and less plebean or vulgar term. Compare <br/>
the use in English of some French terms instead of regular English. Some <br/>
examples: "mutton" to replace the good old Anglo-Saxon "sheep meat"; "It has a <br/>
certain 'je ne sais quois'" rather than "it has a certain 'I don't know what'"; <br/>
or "that was its raison d'être" rather than "that was its reason for being."<br/>

<br/>
It's "hara-kiri", not "hari kari" or even Harry Caray.<br/>
�� "hara" is stomach, &#65533;&#65533;&#65533;@"kiri" is to cut. Read in<br/>
that order, ��&#65533;&#65533;&#65533;@it's "hara kiri". <br/>
<br/>
If you flip the order, &#65533;&#65533;&#65533;&#65533;, it's "seppuku". ��<br/>
"setsu" and �� being "fuku", which in combination<br/>
become "seppuku". <br/>
<br/>
Has nothing to do with the weapon being used. <br/>

is your actual joke--seems like you replied to me<br/>
once, and then a second time to clarify--and I didn't<br/>
get the first message. Also, for some reason, the<br/>
characters aren't coming out correctly, even though my<br/>
encoding is set correctly, or it seems to be. <br/>

I've noticed that alot about Yahoo groups. The main problem <br/>
seems to be posting from the Yahoo website (as opposed to composing <br/>
an email in an email program and sending it to the mailing list, like <br/>
I'm doing now).<br/>
<br/>
I think the main problem is that even if you can see Japanese on <br/>
your screen, Yahoo won't handle it properly. The person who is posting <br/>
has to make sure that they change the dialog box at the bottom of <br/>
the screen (the one that says "What language is this post in?") from <br/>
English to Japanese.<br/>
<br/>
Even after doing that I think that Yahoo is notoriously bad at this. I <br/>
think that the only real way to solve it is to send an email from an <br/>
email program.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Jay--<br/>
<br/>
I always access the list through email--never through<br/>
the website. The issue is that my encoding at home was<br/>
somehow set to "Japanese-Shift JIS", and not<br/>
"Japanese-Autoselect" like normal. For whatever<br/>
reason, it wouldn't change to Autoselect when I tried<br/>
to change it--it kept reverting back. Hence, Kitsuno's<br/>
"hara" came up correctly, but the second set of<br/>
characters was just random katakana. <br/>
<br/>
The other issue was that somehow, Kitsuno's first post<br/>
got sent about 7 hours after his second. Normally<br/>
things get posted late if someone has to "check" them<br/>
and say they are okay--since Kitsuno's a moderator<br/>
himself, that's not the issue. It was just....weird.<br/>
<br/>

shut when I'm not really sure of the circumstances. I wonder how many <br/>
more times I'll have to learn this lesson before it sinks in...<br/>

 </span></blockquote>The whole thing came up as "moji-bake" for me. I couldn't read any <br/>
of Kitsuno's kanji. When I look at the header of his email, it says <br/>
that the email was encoded as:<br/>
Content-Type: text/plain; charset=ISO-8859-1<br/>
<br/>
This is not a kanji-friendly encoding.<br/>

one of life's little mysteries, I guess. :)<br/>
