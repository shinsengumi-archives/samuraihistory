Though not all monks were truly retired!<br/>

"samurai" was a status, not a job. You can't "give it<br/>
up". It's a hereditary social status. You don't do<br/>
anything to become a "samurai" but be born to a<br/>
samurai family. Generally speaking, you don't do<br/>
anything to stop being "samurai" but die. Even if<br/>
banished or something, that didn't take away who<br/>
someone was. You could be banished to live with the<br/>
Hinin or Eta or Ezo or whomever, and you were a<br/>
samurai living with the hinin or eta or ezo. You were<br/>
born samurai, you lived samurai, you died samurai. No<br/>
one ever bothers to ask questions like this about the<br/>
Brahmin caste in India. It's very simple. <br/>

foolish question. Perhaps I phrased my question in a way that is too simplistic. <br/>
Some time ago I attended a tea ceremony with a Japanese master of this art. <br/>
My family was honored by recieving the first taste of the tea. The man who <br/>
performed the tea ceremony explained that the art of tea was often taken up by <br/>
samurai as they grew older and took up the pursuits of maturity. For this reason <br/>
I thought that the stages of a samurai's life might be named in some way, and <br/>
that there might be a partiular label given to the samrai as he matured.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>It's not a foolish question. Just one with a simple<br/>
answer. What is foolish is when the answer is given,<br/>
people want to argue or play semantical games with it.<br/>
I didn't mean to imply it was a stupid question--it's<br/>
just that many times that kind of question comes from<br/>
those who have a ridiculously romanticized idea of<br/>
what being a samurai is--that it's some lofty thing<br/>
that only those who live by Hagakure and so forth can<br/>
obtain. It's not. It's a hereditary social class.<br/>
Plain and simple. <br/>
<br/>
Your question is fine. The answer is that you don't<br/>
"retire" from being a samurai, anymore than I would<br/>
retire from being American. It's something you are<br/>
born as. If you're looking for a particular word that<br/>
describes a samurai who is no longer active in the<br/>
world, then there isn't one, specifically. There are<br/>
words for monk, if he becomes one, or recluse, or so<br/>
forth, but not anything that means "a samurai who no<br/>
longer does anything". <br/>
