<div id="ygrps-yiv-1957274744">Hello<br/>
<br/>
My name is Jacob. I am a life long martial artist. I thank you for <br/>
letting me join this group. I only discovered the Samurai in 2003, <br/>
ofcourse I had heard of them before, but I didnt really know anything <br/>
about them. As corney as it may sound, the film The Last Samurai got <br/>
me intrested, after that I discovered my calling. I started to read <br/>
any book I could find on the Samurai and their code of moral conduct, <br/>
Bushido. The more I read, the more they fascinated me. How, with a <br/>
few exceptions, these brave men (and sometimes even women to) lived <br/>
by a strict moral code, from the time they woke up in the moring to <br/>
the time they went to sleep. The trained in the art of the sword, and <br/>
help honor above all. I felt alonging to become like this, but <br/>
ofcourse I thought the Samurai were gone, just like most warriors of <br/>
old. But then I discorverd that people were still practicing their <br/>
ways, and tring to live as much like a Samurai as one could in this <br/>
day and age. This is a goal in which I would like to strive for. I am <br/>
doing my best to study the philosophy of Bushido and to learn the Art <br/>
of the Sword on my own, unfortunatly there are no dojos in columbia <br/>
South Carolina that teach such things. If there is anyone on this <br/>
group that could help me I would be greatly honored. Thank you.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Apparently you haven't done enough reading. Long story short, you are<br/>
talking about a few people during the Edo period, who lived long after<br/>
there were any battles to fight, and they could therefore afford to<br/>
make a religion out of being a "Samurai".<br/>
<br/>
Might want to take a look at the "Misconceptions of the Samurai", on<br/>
the front page of this group, and start reading history books, rather<br/>
than philosophy.  <br/>
<br/>
Otherwise, welcome!</div>

Welcome. Do read the misconceptions page and do keep looking around  <br/>
for a dojo. There is an All US Kendo Federation dojo in Charleston,<br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.auskf.info/dojo/sc.htm">http://www.auskf.info/dojo/sc.htm</a><br/>
Perhaps if you contact them they would know of folks in your area  <br/>
doing Kendo or Iaido. Also check your local Aikido dojo as these tend  <br/>
to attract Budo Bums of all stripes and you may encounter someone  <br/>
doing Iai. Not really schools of "Bushido" but a good way to touch  <br/>
base with the culture while you learn more of your subject. Study  <br/>
hard and if you are truly serious there are schools of Koryu Kenjutsu  <br/>
here and there for a more authentic experience, but no small  <br/>
committment...<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-30753542">Hello how are you? I am just north of Charlotte NC and I can help you with all kinds of things. I know enough Nihongo to help you speak it and if I can I know someone who can. And the sword issue we got you covered there too. I have seen the corrections that the scholars give in this site and I feel that if you need to know something just ask and some one will get the correct answer to you as soon as possible. However, for any of those things I mentioned earlier just contact me off of the group and I would be way more than happy to help you. GOD BLESS YOU<br/>
