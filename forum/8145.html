<h3>Armies of Sengoku period</h3>
by <i>apcollyer01</i>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-678652945">I was wondering if the subscribers of this group could answer a <br/>
question regarding the composition of samurai armies circa 1582-1600.<br/>
<br/>
We are a group of wargamers interested in Japanese Samurai history & <br/>
battles. We want to know the actual involvment of peseants/baggage <br/>
handlers porters etc that accompanied the samurai in battles of this <br/>
period. We have two trains of thought that these were enrolled in the <br/>
armies and fought along with the ashigaru units.  The other that they <br/>
were a non combative role and remained in the rear even though <br/>
technically they may have been armed with some weapons etc.<br/>
<br/>
Any ideas or responses would be appreciated.<br/>

<br/>
I think that that you may be trying to invent a class here. There were <br/>
very low ranking samurai who doubled as peasants in that they actually <br/>
engaged in agriculture. But, they were members of the buke class. <br/>
Another issue is that this was a time when there was a fair demand for <br/>
soldiers, so a peasant might run away and try to join somebody's army. <br/>
Regardless, I believe that there is a fairly recent scholarly text on <br/>
"Samurai Warfare" available. There may have also been camp followers, <br/>
but these would have been scavengers. Regardless, I do not recall <br/>
battle paintings showing secondary groups of support units. Finally, <br/>
given the relative scarcity of iron in Japan, I rather doubt that <br/>
anyone was being frivolously armed. The same goes for horses.</div>
