<h3>Sekigahara 1600 - The final struggle for power</h3>
by <i>takayama_hara</i>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-2055455286">I am having trouble with the exact meaning of a term used in the <br/>
book "Sekigahara 1600 - The final struggle for power".  In the section <br/>
called "Ueda Castle", on page 43 the sentence reads "He was under <br/>
orders to "mask" the loyalist stronghold of Ueda castle...".  I have an <br/>
idea what is meant by bask but could anyone (author included) clarify <br/>
that term for me?<br/>
<br/>
Also, the Sanada Masayuki is the same as the Takeda general... correct?<br/>
<br/>
Thanks,<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>"Masking" is the same as "guarding" or "covering" in a<br/>
modern military doctrinal context--the idea was to<br/>
leave a force strong enough to prevent the Sanada from<br/>
leaving Ueda Castle and attacking the the Tokugawa<br/>
main bottle in the rear.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Essentially, yes--he was supposed to leave a covering<br/>
force (bigger than a screening force--more stopping<br/>
power, US Army doctrinally speaking) and continue with<br/>
his main body to the battlefield at Sekigahara. The<br/>
trouble was that he decided to take Ueda-jo, and<br/>
missed the battle at Sekigahara altogether.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Um, yeah, though not sure I agree with that football<br/>
reference. It wasn't a misdirection kind of thing--he<br/>
didn't fake one way, and go another. It's more like <br/>
he was supposed to send the fullback to block the<br/>
linebacker (Sanada), but sent the whole offensive<br/>
line.<br/>

football, and semantics. So that's what happens when<br/>

 </span></blockquote>He wasn't a decoy--that was my whole point. It wasn't<br/>
a feint to divert enemy forces--he was to leave enough<br/>
forces to physically prevent the Sanada from affecting<br/>
the battle, and hurry with his main body. He didn't do<br/>
that--he kept his entire force there at Ueda, causing<br/>
all of his soldiers (50,000, IIRC) to miss the main<br/>
battle at Sekigahara. The important effect was that it<br/>
kept a lot of Tokugawa forces out of the battle. Being<br/>
as Tokugawa won, it's merely a footnote. Had he lost,<br/>
it could have been devastating.<br/>

You're playing a game against another team, and<br/>
they've got one winger who isn't deadly, but has the<br/>
good game now and then, and deserves to have one<br/>
defenseman tail him the whole game. Instead, you have<br/>
your whole defensive line follow that one guy around,<br/>
leaving the rest of his team's offense open. Overkill,<br/>
since the guy isn't all that good, really--and you've<br/>
got guys missing in the areas where they could make plays.<br/>

<br/>
OK, so you've got the NHL owners (Tokugawa) and the NHL players<br/>
(Sanada). The NHL players want a higher share of revenue (land), while<br/>
the NHL owners want to limit the amount of revenue that the players can<br/>
have, in order to stop the NHL players individually taking up a large<br/>
percentage of the total revenue of the NHL owners.<br/>
<br/>
So, rather than continuing on with the season while devoting a portion<br/>
of resources to deal with the situation, a lock-out is put in effect and<br/>
all resources are used up to deal with the problem, potentially having a<br/>
fatal effect on the future of the NHL.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Tokugawa had 30,000 of his own troops (and several thousand more <br/>
under Ikeda, Asano, et al) present on the battlefield that were never <br/>
engaged, so the size of the attacking force was not a problem. <br/>
The rout began shortly after Kobayakawa turned traitor and other <br/>
nearby Western troops also defected, overunning Otani and getting <br/>
into the rear of the Konishi and Ukita forces (who had been bearing <br/>
the brunt of the Eastern assault). The Shimazu had been holding their <br/>
ground quite well and only left the battlefield when the Ukita and <br/>
Konishi forces broke up and the Ishida forces had fled. Out of the <br/>
1500 Shimazu troops, very few survived the retreat.</div>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1501510479">Interesting post and insihgtful...  I will have to get this book and learn <br/>
more,  tahnks for the post and information.  The good side of the battle is that <br/>
it somewaht put and end to the civil wars winthin Janpan...  I am thinig that <br/>
the down side is that once in power;  Japan shut herself off almost eniterly <br/>
from the outside world.  Leaving her behind the rest of the world and it's <br/>
advancements.  to some it may have been a good thing; but looking at Japan after <br/>
the fall of the towkagawa fealm;  Japan had alot of catching up to do...   ie <br/>
after the landing of  Perry.<br/>
