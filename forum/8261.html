can't spell "dissertation". <br/>
<br/>
Okay, I'm sorry--I'm not trying to pick on you, in<br/>
particular. However, recently we've had quite a lot of<br/>
"wat do u lik about teh samuria??? ninja are teh<br/>
suxors!!!11!" type posts from list members. This is<br/>
unacceptable.<br/>
<br/>
If you (general "you", not foxfoil in particular) are<br/>
above the age of 13, write like it. Otherwise, you<br/>
will not be taken seriously. Many posters come from<br/>
non-English speaking countries, and English is not<br/>
their native language--we are fully accepting of your<br/>
mistakes, because you try. I'm certainly not capable<br/>
of typing in Spanish or Russian, so I won't criticize<br/>
your efforts in English. Likewise for posters who have<br/>
handicaps such as dyslexia. If someone doesn't fall<br/>
into these categories and writes they're on a Teen<br/>
Beat L33t message board, most of the serious regulars<br/>
will assume you are 12 years old. If you are not, then<br/>
the moderators will not take your question seriously<br/>
if you don't take things like spelling "samurai" (it's<br/>
not samuria, saumari, or any other variation I've seen<br/>
in the last few days) seriously. <br/>
<br/>
Laziness isn't an excuse. <br/>
<br/>
--The Mgmt. <br/>
<br/>
Now, to your question:<br/>
<br/>
 on how samurai<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> > culture is beeing depicted in hollywood <br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>If you want to look at charicatures of samurai foisted<br/>
upon us by Hollywood, those are good movies to look<br/>
at. However, none of them accurately picture anything.<br/>
Of course, no "Hollywood" movies do. Perhaps that can<br/>
be your main point. <br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> > my question is, what are your opinion on the<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I recommend watching as many Japanese movies depicting<br/>
the samurai as you can, and contrasting them with the<br/>
generalized "Ooh, check out the exotic Asians doing<br/>
Zen and martial arts" put out by Hollywood. <br/>
<br/>
There's a fairly recent book out that discusses<br/>
Japanese cinema, especially Kurosawa and other samurai<br/>
films--I'm not sure of the name, but someone here<br/>
knows for sure, since I've seen it referenced. <br/>

 </span></blockquote>Ooooh, don't get me started on this.....   :<<br/>
<br/>
There are so many Western misconceptions of samurai history and culture. Let <br/>
me count the ways.....   <eye rollage><br/>
<br/>
In the first place, a real samurai was born and (for the most part) lived in <br/>
one country, JAPAN during a specific period of history. From around 1100 until <br/>
around 1868 (NOTE: please anyone correct me on the specifics of dates; I <br/>
forget the exact year that the samurai class was officially abolished). After the <br/>
samurai were officially abolished in Japan, there WERE NO MORE SAMURAI. <br/>
<br/>
In the second place, a samurai was almost always born into the samurai class. <br/>
In general, a person couldn't wake up and tell himself, "gee, I think I'd <br/>
really like a career as a samurai, so I'll enroll in Samurai 101 at the Samurai <br/>
University." Once in a while, a non-samurai could be married into a samurai <br/>
family, usually as an adopted son. But for the most part, a samurai was born, not <br/>
made.  <br/>
<br/>
In the third place, the Western idea of samurai women as being wafting, week, <br/>
simpering Oriental beauties, just waiting for a strong, strapping Tom Cruise <br/>
clone to rescue her from the cruel, sinister evil male-chauvinist-pig Oriental <br/>
men: this is purely a fantasy. <br/>
<br/>
NOTE HERE: we already had a long, involved discussion about the real roles of <br/>
women in historical samurai culture on the forum and probably here as well. <br/>
So with the above, I do NOT intend to get involved in such a discussion again. <br/>
What I meant above is that Western mythmakers have a whole lot of fantasies <br/>
about servile, compliant, helpless Asian women, and this is reflected in a lot <br/>
of Western movies and novels. <br/>
<br/>
A prime example of Western misconceptions about the samurai is in comparing <br/>
the films THE SEVEN SAMURAI and THE MAGNIFICENT SEVEN. The latter film was <br/>
taken from the former as a "western" version. <br/>
<br/>
THE MAGNIFICENT SEVEN was a great film in its own right, but it is NOT a <br/>
parallel to the culture shown in THE SEVEN SAMURAI.  Western gunfighters are not <br/>
Japanese ronin; western gunfighters don't have the same issues, culture, or <br/>
place as Japanese ronin.  A person in the U.S. could decide that, "I think I'll <br/>
become a gunfighter," then could study hard and then go forth in this career. <br/>
<br/>
A Japanese ronin rarefly became a ronin by choice. Usually he was forced into <br/>
this role by some event in history. And also, a ronin could not be a ronin <br/>
without first being a samurai. So he had to be born into the samurai class, <br/>
unlike western U.S. gunfighters, who could be born in any class or background.<br/>
<br/>
And then there are the vast differences between 17th century Japan itself and <br/>
19th century U.S. I could write a book on this. <br/>
<br/>
Enough for now. Nina</div>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1762472734">I recently purchased an excellent book called 'The  Samurai Film' by Alain Silver. It was recently updated, and has some  nice photographs as well. Although it cover many Japanese samurai  films, it also deals with some western films. <br/>
  <br/>
  I would also recommend the Akira Kurosawa documentary which can be  found on DVD. No worries for non-Japanese speakers--it is done in  English. <br/>
  <br/>
  You may also want to look into adaptations of Kurosawa movies which  were mostly 'western' western films. For example... 'The Magnificent  Seven.' I'm not sure it would fit into what you are trying to do, but  it might be a unique angle.<br/>

I think laziness is not their excuse but mistype is. If you type samurai<br/>
using ten fingers fast, sometimes you mistype samurai as samuria. :-) I<br/>
sometimes do, but not in this group as I can recall. But if the poster type:<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-901404222">Dear Foxfoil-<br/>
	You have set for yourself an enormous task. As you can see there are  <br/>
many strong opinions here, the underlying theme being if you are  <br/>
going to write about the conception of the samurai you had first  <br/>
better know from real history just what a samurai really is (was).  <br/>
Will you study only one period in Japanese History as background or  <br/>
all of it? The samurai dominated art, culture and politics for close  <br/>
to a thousand years. What will be your control model? How western  <br/>
scholars view the samurai? How Japanese scholars view him? How  <br/>
Japanese popular culture sees him today or how he was viewed in context?<br/>
	There are a lot of great films out there, what is the cut off for  <br/>
"modern Hollywood film?" Is "Memoirs" included in your list? Would  <br/>
you include Black Rain? or Mr Baseball? or Gung-ho? None feature a  <br/>
man in 16th century armour but all feed the (mis-)conception. What  <br/>
about The Octagon, The Challenge, Red Sun, Bushido Blade or The  <br/>
Yakuza? or even The Killer Elite or Bataan and a dozen other war  <br/>
films? are they too old to be "modern?" How are you going to sort  <br/>
them out and decide what to include and what to ignore? It is a big  <br/>
job. It certainly can be done but you may need to tighten your focus  <br/>
or you'll wind up starting off on a career rather than a dissertation...<br/>

head, you could also discuss the Clint Eastwood movies<br/>
("For a Few Dollars More", "a Fist Full of Dollars",<br/>
"The Good, The Bad, and The Ugly") that were<br/>
adaptations of the Kurosawa "Yojimbo", "Sanjuro"<br/>
series. Also of interest would be Kuroawa's effect on<br/>
Star Wars, which I think Lucas talks about on the<br/>
Kurosawa DVD. <br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Correct, Dan--up until Hideyoshi's edicts, most<br/>
samurai of the lower and middle levels were also<br/>
involved in agriculture. The common term is<br/>
"Jizamurai", n, indicating the samurai had a<br/>
connection with the land. These warrior-farmers could<br/>
include peasant farmers who only served as ashigaru<br/>
when called up, and returned to the rice paddies when<br/>
not at war, but mostly refer to samurai who owned<br/>
fields and may have been small plantation owners. <br/>
<br/>
The strict division Nina mentions is largely an<br/>
Edo-period construct--prior to the edicts, there was<br/>
much more ambiguity, and the right combination of<br/>
opportunity and skill could lead a lower-class peasant<br/>
or merchant to not only become a samurai, but to<br/>
become a daimyo, a la Saito Dosan (a former oil<br/>
merchant) or Toyotomi Hideyoshi***. If these famous<br/>
cases exist, it's certainly likely that many more<br/>
people were able to transition from peasant to<br/>
lower-level warrior, ashigaru, etc. <br/>
<br/>
That being said, we shouldn't assume that prior to the<br/>
Edo period you could, as Nina says, "enroll in Samurai<br/>
101" and become a samurai. It was definitely easier in<br/>
periods of national turmoil, such as the Sengoku<br/>
period, when anyone of skill would be utilized, and<br/>
could make a name for themselves (and then invent a<br/>
lineage later). You don't hear of too many situations<br/>
like Dosan and Hideyoshi in the Heian or Kamakura<br/>
periods, for example. This was due to many factors,<br/>
most of which changed during the Sengoku. Previously,<br/>
ashigaru weren't considered "samurai"--they were cheap<br/>
footsoldiers recruited from the peasantry to put<br/>
spears in the field, but weren't a professional or<br/>
even semi-professional fighting force. As the scale of<br/>
warfare grew, new weapons (guns, the longer spears<br/>
carried by ashigaru, etc.) and new tactics were<br/>
developed, and consequently you couldn't just round up<br/>
a bunch of farmers, give them spears, and send them<br/>
off to fight. While early guns didn't require as much<br/>
training as the sword or bow, they still required<br/>
training--and once trained, a daimyo isn't just going<br/>
to release his new ashigaru to their own devices.<br/>
Samurai combat became more and more an ashigaru<br/>
fight--led by upper level samurai, but the footsoldier<br/>
was vitally important to the success of Oda Nobunaga,<br/>
etc. As this importance was realized, ashigaru were<br/>
granted more status, gradually separated from their<br/>
farming duties (though warfare frequently stopped so<br/>
fields could be tended up into the 1570's), and<br/>
signing up as an ashigaru became a way to "get<br/>
noticed"--Hideyoshi's path to glory, along with many<br/>
who he brought up with him, started this way. As I<br/>
said before, in the period of civil war a good soldier<br/>
was a good soldier, regardless of his parentage, and<br/>
would be promoted and given leadership roles and<br/>
prestige if warranted. <br/>
<br/>
At the end of the Sengoku, this need to utilize<br/>
talented people regardless of background ends.<br/>
Hideyoshi's edicts made the separation between the<br/>
classes, and recognized the ashigaru as the lowest<br/>
level of samurai. Those jizamurai who both fought and<br/>
farmed were forced to choose between the two<br/>
professions, and more chose farming than you would<br/>
think. <br/>
<br/>
Also, even those who "rose from the masses" took great<br/>
pains to either hide or compensate for their humble<br/>
backgrounds. Hideyoshi had himself "adopted" by a<br/>
Fujiwara nobleman, to legitimize his position. <br/>
<br/>
***It should be noted that the notion of Hideyoshi<br/>
beginning life as a vagabond peasant is mostly<br/>
romantic fiction. Research indicates his father was an<br/>
ashigaru under Oda Nobuhide, so while he may have<br/>
floated between classes early in his life (different<br/>
stories have him selling needles as an itinerant<br/>
merchant, farming, training as a priest, traveling<br/>
around for work as a stableboy, etc.), he had a<br/>
connection to the warrior class from the beginning. <br/>

 </span></blockquote>I think that, before Hideyoshi's famous "sword hunt" that many farmers were <br/>
armed with swords and other weapons. And also there was a class of people, I <br/>
believe they were called "Ji-samurai" or "farmer-samurai" who worked the fields <br/>
but also could fight in battles. Not sure, please anyone feel free to correct <br/>
me.<br/>
<br/>
But definitely after Hideyoshi's "sword-hunt," a samurai was definitely born, <br/>
not made.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Agreed, 150%. While there *were* the *EXTREMELY RARE*<br/>
exception, 99.9999999999999999999999999999% of the<br/>
time, post-1600 one had to be born into the samurai<br/>
class to be a samurai. That was the only requirement,<br/>
as well--behavioral codes, martial arts, etc. had<br/>
nothing to do with it. <br/>

 </span></blockquote>The Edo period began in 1600 or 1603, depending on<br/>
whether you date from Sekigahara or the beginning of<br/>
the Tokugawa Shogunate. You're correct, the sword hunt<br/>
was in 1588--12 to 15 years earlier. However, it's not<br/>
like he gave the order and *poof* things were<br/>
solidified. Major social changes like this take a<br/>
little time to take effect. You could argue that up<br/>
through the Osaka campaign, it was possible to change<br/>
status through armed conflict--certainly enough<br/>
outside the establishment joined the Toyotomi cause in<br/>
order to make a name for themselves. The majority<br/>
would have been ronin, and you could say they were "in<br/>
the samurai class", but I hardly think they checked<br/>
for Samurai ID cards at the door. <br/>
<br/>
I'll admit, I'm considering 12 years as an<br/>
insignificant stretch of time in the 1000 years of<br/>
samurai history. Especially in this case, the Sword<br/>
Hunt and the social concepts it heralded were direct<br/>
precursors to the social order of the Tokugawa period,<br/>
and not part of the Sengoku. Hideyoshi wasn't merely<br/>
before the Tokugawa, he set the stage for it. The idea<br/>
was there, the law was there, but it really only<br/>
became something solid after peace. People up unto the<br/>
1630's still had the institutional memory of the<br/>
previous social order--I don't think it's a<br/>
coincidence that the last major rebellion against the<br/>
Tokugawa, the Shimabara Rebellion, was a<br/>
commoner/lower-class samurai rebellion that took place<br/>
in the 1630's. Past this, anybody who had any memory<br/>
of commoners carrying weapons and partaking in combat<br/>
was dead--the rest accepted the status quo because<br/>
it's all they knew. <br/>

<h3>Re: samurai culture</h3>
by <i>thomas_tessera</i>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1916086788">"And also there was a class of people, I believe they were called<br/>
"Ji-samurai" or "farmer-samurai" who worked the fields but also could<br/>
fight in battles. Not sure, please anyone feel free to correct me."<br/>
<br/>
I think that's about right. 'Samurai' status covered the richest to<br/>
the poorest, and many samurai were dirt poor, working alongside their<br/>
farmers in the fields if they wanted to eat.<br/>
<br/>
Stories of early Tokugawa (Matsudaira) retainers tell of samurai<br/>
lining the rice field with sandals hung from the shafts of their<br/>
spears, and in one case a samurai covered himself in mud in the hope<br/>
that a 15-year-old Ieyasu might not recognise him, and how low he had<br/>
fallen.<br/>
<br/>
Another of the era tell of a samurai who lost his Takeda 'castle' (not<br/>
much more than a stockade) when the land fell to Tokugawa. The<br/>
structure was burned down and he became an inn-keeper.<br/>
<br/>
Of the same era are stories of peasants elevated in status at the whim<br/>
of the Shogun.<br/>
<br/>
The situation grows even more complex if you look at Shikoku after<br/>
Sekigahara, when it was ruled that samurai must be attached to the<br/>
castle, any farmer must therefore surrender his samurai status. This<br/>
was a move to stop rebellion, by making the samurai absolutely<br/>
dependent upon the bakafu for their survival. It reintroduced the<br/>
'goshi' - a gentleman farmer who might well be richer than his samurai<br/>
neighbour (and better skilled in the carriage of arms).<br/>
<br/>
In fact the Shikoku goshi was closer to the original samurai than his<br/>
Edo counterpart, who became more and more a time-serving bureaucrat,<br/>
and one might say the mantle of most of what people think of as<br/>
samurai passed to him. Certainly the Tosa swordsmen (of whom Ryoma was<br/>
one) kept the classical arts of the warrior very much alive and 'real'<br/>
as opposed to the artificiality that was creeping into the<br/>
professional Edo dojo. <br/>
<br/>
"But definitely after Hideyoshi's "sword-hunt," a samurai was<br/>
definitely born, not made."<br/>
That was the rule, but I think at the time it was hard to enforce -<br/>
and of course was at the whim of whoever was in charge. Hideyoshi<br/>
himself 'elevated' commoners to samurai - Kato Kiyomasa was the son of<br/>
a blacksmith. So did Ieyasu after him.<br/>
<br/>
Certainly post-Edo it was the case.<br/>
<br/>
I think basically the rule was not made to protect or preserve samurai<br/>
status, but as a means of social control and restraint.<br/>
