I just uploaded the map from Turnbull. It is in the files section in <br/>
a folder called Bill M. Creative ain't I! :-)<br/>
<br/>
If anybody can mark on the map where the Byodo-in is I wouls be <br/>
greatly pleased. Any other details you can add would be great as well!<br/>

 </span></blockquote>I think I see one potential problem. The Turnbull map is a much larger <br/>
scale than the maps I've been linking to. The map from the book is <br/>
indeed oriented the same way - North is up. But the scal is so much <br/>
larger, that Uji appears as just a dot. The maps that I've linked to <br/>
recently basically show "inside the dot".<br/>
<br/>
If a person were to mark where the Byou-dou-in is on that Turnbull <br/>
map, it would just be a tiny dot inside the circle that is marked <br/>
Uji.<br/>
<br/>
Does that make sense?<br/>
<br/>
By the way thanks for going to the effort to scan the map. It makes <br/>
the conversation much easier!<br/>

Yes it makes absolute sense. If you were to read Turnbulls text that goes<br/>
with the map it would be more clear as to why I was confused. He states<br/>
that the Byou-dou-in lies between Nara and the Uji bridge. Which is true,<br/>
but looking at the map you would think that it was located somewhere along<br/>
the road running south from the bridge. Thats why the rest of his<br/>
description of the battle was hard to follow. You would never know that the<br/>
building was within view of the bridge.<br/>

	One thing to keep in mind is that the holdings of many temples were <br/>
considerably larger back in the day, so it is entirely possible that it <br/>
did run along the road south of the bridge at one time. Sadly many <br/>
great temples and shrines are reduced to just the main buildings on <br/>
tracts just big enough to hold them...<br/>
