I think also you need an archery specialist.  Just as for swords that require a specialist knowledge of readings I'm sure the same is true for bows and that whole specialised area of kyudo.  I have a mate who is "into" this kind of object and I'll run it past him.  I've made a note of your post, the replies and saved your images and while I won't forget it is likely to take a while to find the right "Round Tuit"!!!  Like Tom, I immediately thought of seal characters and I do have Hawley's chart on this script - somewhere - but as Tom says the real meaning is more likely locked in the time and place of the culture that made the bow, rather than in a literal translation of the characters.<br/>

<h3>Re: Yumi</h3>
by <i>tgood_us</i>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-892583876">Than you very much.  I knew that the dailect was very old and has <br/>
changed in meaning or is forgotten.  Also people said that it could <br/>
be Chinese.  I have a answer to your question (probaly with some <br/>
embelishment) about the pull strength.  It was problay about 20 <br/>
pounds stronger than when the yumi was refined and made with the same <br/>
care as a sword i.e weight and balance to the person and the like.  <br/>
But "history" shows of a samurai named Minamoto no Tametomo.  He was <br/>
a very large and powerful man.  They said that He ultimately provoked <br/>
the central government into sending an armada of twenty small <br/>
warships in an attempt to force him to pay.  As a gesture of <br/>
defience, Tametomo decided to shoot a large, bulbed arrow over the <br/>
bow of one of the ships, but it struck the wooden hull a few inches <br/>
above the waterline instead.  The shot was so powerful that the arrow <br/>
penetrated both sides of the vessel, creating two gaping holes.  Sea <br/>
water poured in and the ship began to sink.  The sight of the warship <br/>
being sunk by a single arrow so frightened the other ships' captains <br/>
that they retreated.  That was what Japanese history said anyway.  <br/>
Again thank you for helping me.  I know alot about Kyudo so if you <br/>
want to know more just let me know.<br/>

Than you very much. I knew that the dailect was very old and has <br/>
changed in meaning or is forgotten. Also people said that it could <br/>
be Chinese. I have a answer to your question (probaly with some <br/>
embelishment) about the pull strength. It was problay about 20 <br/>
pounds stronger than when the yumi was refined and made with the same <br/>
care as a sword i.e weight and balance to the person and the like. <br/>
But "history" shows of a samurai named Minamoto no Tametomo. He was <br/>
a very large and powerful man. They said that He ultimately provoked <br/>
the central government into sending an armada of twenty small <br/>
warships in an attempt to force him to pay. As a gesture of <br/>
defience, Tametomo decided to shoot a large, bulbed arrow over the <br/>
bow of one of the ships, but it struck the wooden hull a few inches <br/>
above the waterline instead. The shot was so powerful that the arrow <br/>
penetrated both sides of the vessel, creating two gaping holes. Sea <br/>
water poured in and the ship began to sink. The sight of the warship <br/>
being sunk by a single arrow so frightened the other ships' captains <br/>
that they retreated. That was what Japanese history said anyway. <br/>
Again thank you for helping me. I know alot about Kyudo so if you <br/>
want to know more just let me know.<br/>
