姫 which I guess would be read Maki-hime.<br/>

Another site says clearly that they had no children together:<br/>

<br/>
It seems that Hirotada married Maki in 1545 and died in early 1549. <br/>
Considering his campaigning during the interim perhaps they had no <br/>
time to have kids.<br/>
<br/>
Yasumitsu was 24 when he died in 1549. Maki lived on until 1571.<br/>
<br/>
Hope this helps a little.<br/>

<br/>
Actually, this helps a great deal, especially as I do not read or <br/>
speak Japanese - so thank you very much.<br/>
<br/>
If you have time (and the inclination) you might take a look at:<br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.samurai-archives.com/jzm.html">http://www.samurai-archives.com/jzm.html</a><br/>
<br/>
The intro of a novel I am writing: the life and times of a fictitious <br/>
nephew of Toda Yasumitsu, who enters Hirotada's service after <br/>
escorting his cousin to Okazaki.<br/>
<br/>
I have revised extensively since this excerpt, and will commence <br/>
looking for an agent/publisher this very month! So you can <br/>
understand why any detail is invaluable.<br/>
