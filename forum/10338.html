<br/>
The absence of an ambassador does not mean that there was no embassy<br/>
functioning at that time. Chiefs of Mission filled in during periods when no<br/>
ambassador was appointed or accredited.<br/>
 <br/>
The Foreign Relations of the United States (FRUS) series presents the<br/>
official documentary historical record of major U.S. foreign policy<br/>
decisions and significant diplomatic activity. If you want to know what the<br/>
United States was doing in Japan and how it viewed Japan, this is the place<br/>
to go. Volumes appeared in various editions and under varying titles until<br/>
1870, when the series became known as Papers Relating to the Foreign<br/>
Relations of the United States. All volumes through 1951 are no longer in<br/>
print at the Government Printing Office, but they may be available in print<br/>
or microform from publishing clearinghouses or commercial reprinting firms.<br/>
In addition, the Foreign Relations series is in most Federal Depository<br/>
Libraries and major university libraries. Volumes which may contain material<br/>
vis a vis Japan during the period in question are as follows:<br/>

I am assuming that the American interest in Japan faded after the American<br/>
Civil War began. However, when the Samurai revolt (probably not the correct<br/>
way of stating it) began in 1871(?), which Tom Cruise played the part of a<br/>
Yankee soldier (The Last Samurai) sent to help the ruling family change the<br/>
method of fighting, criticism of the movie was mostly about the Americans<br/>
not being involved but the Portugese and Germans. Was their ever any attempt<br/>
to have the Americans assist in the training? Did the United States have any<br/>
type of consul or ambassador in Japan during this period? <br/>
