<h3>Your own culture</h3>
by <i>zevlord</i>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1453080485">Hi everyone,<br/>
Was just wondering if there are may people that are in the same <br/>
situation as myself. See I'm an ABC (Australian Born Chinese). Thing <br/>
is, I know more about Japanese history then I do my own. I know very <br/>
little about Chinese history and what I do know about Australian <br/>
history is what I have learnt from school. To me Australian history <br/>
is very hmm how would you say? "Mind-numbing", we only have around <br/>
two hundred years of history so it isn't as impressive as other <br/>
cultures. I do have an interest in Chinese history, however is not a <br/>
priority for me at the moment. One day, sometime in the near future I <br/>
do plan on correcting this. So I guess what I'm asking is, are there <br/>
others that know more about a specific culture then they do their own.<br/>

My blood partially comes from an Native American tribe called the Arapaho and another called Pima. I have read and researched alot on the Japanese Culture, so yes I do know more about Japanese history that I do my own history. Although I am taking the advice and will be digging deeper into my history, I will continue learning about Japan. I have been there once and plan to visit alot more.      -TRES-<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Hey there Tres and Dave <br/>
Good to hear from you both thought I might be the only one in this <br/>
situation. Tres your background sound really interesting, will read <br/>
up on both the Arapaho and Pima cultures as I know next to nothing <br/>
about them. Dave your family has a coat of arms that so cool. So with <br/>
luck you could trace your history back to the medieval times. <br/>
Wouldn't it be something if you found that your family was actually <br/>
part royalty? If you can give me a picture of you family coat of arms <br/>
I would be very grateful, would also like to look into this if that <br/>
ok with you. <br/>
I spoke to my Uncle (Mothers side) last night about a family tree <br/>
that he had put together quite sometime ago, I have never see it so I <br/>
asked him to send me a copy. This will be my starting point and with <br/>
this I hope to be able to learn more about my ancestors and culture. <br/>
I don't think anyone in my Fathers side has done a family tree yet so <br/>
my brother and I are looking into this at the moment. Maybe that's <br/>
something you both could look into, maybe someone in your family has <br/>
already done a family tree or maybe you will need to start the ball <br/>
rolling. Anyways good luck and let us know how you go.<br/>
