<h3>An overview of Samurai Champloo</h3>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-63453740">An overview of Samurai Champloo<br/>
<br/>
Samurai Champloo is an anime title consisting of 26 episodes that <br/>
began broadcasting on Fuji TV in Japan on May 19, 2004, directed by <br/>
Shinichiro Watanabe of Cowboy Bebop fame. The show, which is set in <br/>
the Edo period, is not a true historical title, but features action, <br/>
adventure, and some comedy blended with an anachronistic hip-hop <br/>
soundtrack. Its name comes from the Okinawan word, "champuru" (e.g. <br/>
goya champuru), which means to mix or blend. <br/>
<br/>
What Watanabe started with Cowboy Bebop he now continues with <br/>
Samurai Champloo. He has created a new genre by implementing a hip-<br/>
hop theme into this title, much like Cowboy Bebop had a blues and <br/>
jazz theme. The score is composed of hip-hop beats by Japanese hip-<br/>
hop artists Nujabes and Tsutchie among others, although the hip-hop <br/>
influence is mostly subtle. Some samurai sport Adidas-like stripe <br/>
patterns on their kimonos, while one of the main characters, Mugen, <br/>
has a capoeira-esque fighting style. The show has many other <br/>
anachronistic elements as well. <br/>
<br/>
The show revolves around three characters: The brash and lanky <br/>
vagabond Mugen, the quiet and stoic ronin Jin, and the cute and <br/>
quick-thinking waitress Fuu. Fuu helps Mugen and Jin escape from a <br/>
vengeful daimyo and, in exchange, she persuades the two to help her <br/>
in her search for a mysterious samurai who smells like sunflowers <br/>
with a coin toss. She will have trouble keeping the two from killing <br/>
each other, though. <br/>
<br/>
Geneon Entertainment licensed the show for distribution in the <br/>
United States nearly a full year prior to the show's airing in <br/>
Japan. This decision was based almost solely on the reputation of <br/>
its creator, Shinichiro Watanabe. On January 20, 2004, it was <br/>
revealed that the broadcasting rights were acquired by Cartoon <br/>
Network, and the series began airing on the Adult Swim block on May <br/>
14, 2005, in the 11:30 PM timeslot. <br/>
<br/>
There is also a manga adaptation of Samurai Champloo that debuted in <br/>
Shonen Ace in January 2004.</div>

<h3>Samurai Champloo on DVD</h3>
by <i>gojiraxena</i>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1563590894">Greetings:<br/>
<br/>
Yes, it is available on DVD. You should be able to find it almost <br/>
anywhere you can find anime. (I actually got my copy of Vol. 1 at Wal-<br/>
Mart)I think Vol. 2 is out, but since I haven't watched Vol. 1 yet, I <br/>
haven't got it yet.<br/>
<br/>
If all else fails, try Amazon, Borders, or Ebay.<br/>
