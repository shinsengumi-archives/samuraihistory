<h3>Another history query re Samurai Deeper Kyo?</h3>
by <i>keiman0</i>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-94923654">In the anime noted above the story is set four years after the (gomen <br/>
the spelling onegai) battle of 'Chekigahara' (Shek-ee-ga-har-a) and <br/>
there is a big Samurai kenjutsu (sword fighting) tournament being held <br/>
by the Shogun of the Toshowgowa Clan. My question is this--what year <br/>
was that battle and was there ever such a tournament? Who won? The <br/>
anime concerns a Battousai or Legendary manslayer nicknamed 'Demon Eyes <br/>
Kyo' whose spirit/soul inhabits the body of a younger hero named <br/>
Yushira. Looks like a cool series and I'm told it actually has an <br/>
ending after 24 eppys. I think that Shina the gal bounty hunter's 3 <br/>
barrelled flintlock pistol is just smoke and mirrors and was never a <br/>
real weapon since flintlocks do not have rotating barrels. Domo arigato <br/>
for your assistance. Kami bless you all. Sayonara-K&K</div>

 </span></blockquote>The battle of Sekigahara happened in 1600.  The rest is pretty much<br/>
just fiction.</div>
