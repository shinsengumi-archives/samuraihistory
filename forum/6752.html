 </span></blockquote>Can you be more specific as to which particular banner<br/>
you mean? If you had a link to a picture or something,<br/>
it would be extremely helpful. <br/>
<br/>
If anyone wants help translating something from<br/>
Japanese, there are several of us (probably more than<br/>
that) that can help. But you've got to set yourself up<br/>
for success--by just throwing the question out there,<br/>
not only do I now have to translate said banner, I've<br/>
got to go looking for it, confirm it's the CORRECT<br/>
banner this person wants to know about, and then<br/>
translate it. It may be as simple as me going to<br/>
google, typing in "Ieyasu Banner" and getting a<br/>
picture. But if you really want your questions<br/>
answered, then you should do the legwork. This board<br/>
isn't here to compensate for your laziness/lack of<br/>
effort. There's no reason you can't go to Google, find<br/>
what you're looking for, and then provide us the link<br/>
to look at so we can help. <br/>
<br/>
Thanks,<br/>
