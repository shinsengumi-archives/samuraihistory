<br/>
I am looking to put on a display in a wargames show in England near Christmas <br/>
and need to know the names of any of the retainers that  were with the Hojo <br/>
either defending Odawara Castle or some of the outlying forts / castles?<br/>
<br/>
I know the Clan Lord was Hojo Ujimasa but did he have any sub commanders etc <br/>
that are known.  If anyone has any info on this particular period I would be <br/>
most greatfull for this. <br/>
<br/>
Thanks<br/>
<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-138629143">Hi there sounds interesting what your doing, <br/>
<br/>
What type of figures are you using to portray the samurai, <br/>
www.Eastofindia are excellent but expensive. Anyway to attempt to <br/>
help you out, the first place you should look is of course <br/>
www.samurai-archives esp <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.samurai-archives.com/registry.html">http://www.samurai-archives.com/registry.html</a><br/>
This gives a list of hundreds of samurai, with good detail on their <br/>
lives. Also reading the article on Hojo Ujimasa would help you. <br/>
<br/>
As far as I can help you I will try, here are some names to look into<br/>
<br/>
First Hojo Ujinao was officially Daimyo of the Hojo although his <br/>
father Hojo Ujimasa still advised him and had control over aspects of <br/>
the clans actions. Initially the Hojou were allied to the Tokugawa <br/>
but later it was revoked and Ieyasu began the siege against Hojou. <br/>
There were attempted negotiations into 1590, only in May of 1590 did <br/>
the invasion of the Hojou lands of Kai, Sagami,Izu, Shimosa, Mushahsi <br/>
etc begin. The scale of the invasion was huge and from all sides, <br/>
including naval contingents. Apparently 200 000 besiegers faced <br/>
50 000 Hojou and allies. The chain of sattilite forts were quickly <br/>
reduced individually as support could not be guarranted. While the <br/>
siege lengthened and the troops on both sides dug in or partied as <br/>
the case of the Besiegers, negotioations contiuned. When in July <br/>
Hideyoshi demanded surrender Hojou Ujinori (Ujimasa brother and <br/>
retainer) went as messenger. Ujimasa wanted to continue fighting but <br/>
Ujinao eventually in Sept surrendered saving himself but Ujimasa and <br/>
Ujiteru (his brother) were forced to commit Seppuku.<br/>
<br/>
As regards to the retainers allied to the Hojou well, first there are <br/>
the family clan members, Ujinao (Son of Ujimasa), Ujimasa (Father <br/>
Ujinao), Hojou Genan (Bro Ujitsuna),Hojo Tsunashige (adopted son of <br/>
Ujitsuna), Hojou Ujiteru (2nd son of Ujiyasu {Father of Ujimasa})<br/>
Ujikuni (3rd son of Ujiyasu, held Hachigata-jo a sattelite castle <br/>
until subdued) Hojou Ujinori (4th son of Ujiyasu)Complicated family <br/>
structure but all employed in defense.<br/>
<br/>
Houjo retainers I can find, not sure about position of all-<br/>
<br/>
Ashikaga Yoshiuji (think he is old Hojo not Sengoku)<br/>
<br/>
Chiba Shigetane (Killed in Sakura castle think Izu province not <br/>
Odawara jo because the campaign would have been conquest of all Hojou <br/>
territory which means 4-5 provinces namely Sagami, Mushashi, Izu, <br/>
part of Kai, Shimosa ,Hitachi)<br/>
<br/>
Daidoji Masahige (one of Hojo Ujimasa's chief advisors, told Ujinao <br/>
avoid pitched battle)<br/>
<br/>
Fuma Kotara (reported leader of Hojo special forces 200 man nija <br/>
esque raid on Takeda forces in 1580, unsure as to if he was there)<br/>
<br/>
Yuki Harumoto (Interesting Daimyo of Shimosa province severed ties <br/>
with Hojou after 1590, forced to break vassalship.<br/>
<br/>
The thing about Odawara castle is that it is not as well known as <br/>
Osaka castle siege, Odawara was the finishing of the Hojou and it <br/>
seems I can find info about who finished them, but not much about who <br/>
attempted to save them, maybe its a case of History is dictated by <br/>
the conquerers. undoubtedly there are 1000s of forgotten names. The <br/>
Hojo were on there way out, their allies deserted them they were <br/>
surrounded having previously helped Nobunaga, then Hideyoshi defeat <br/>
the Takeda, they brought their own downfall. Like rats deserting a <br/>
sinking ship many samurai choose to throw in their lot with the <br/>
strong side, leaving the Hojou surrounded and weak, there were many <br/>
rats left clinging to the ship when it went down but many have been <br/>
forgoten. <br/>
<br/>
I was thinking that in Turnbulls book on samurai heraldry there is a <br/>
picture of the siege of Odawara, but thats me mixing it up with <br/>
Osaka. I think in general it will be alot harder for you to portray <br/>
Odawara because of the scanty information. The best way in my opinion <br/>
would be to show depending on your scale, a surrounded castle town, <br/>
with drooping banners on the castle walls, the inhabitants running <br/>
out of ideas and hope, while an almost carnival atmosphere exists <br/>
around the besiegers, with samurai on a war-peace footing capable of <br/>
changing at different moments, long periods of boredom with the <br/>
occasional moment of action (like war in general, even the 2nd world <br/>
war) <br/>
<br/>
I wish you luck with it, Ill continue to look for info, also I live <br/>
in the North of England and am interested about your idea, it would <br/>
be good to see when finished. The Royal armouries in Leeds is a great <br/>
place to be inspired by seeing real sengoku period artifacts. If I <br/>
can help anymore don't hesitate to ask <br/>
<br/>
Before I finish I just read the article on the pre modern history of <br/>
Odawara in the samurai archives articles section, you should read <br/>
this, the siege is more complicated than I realised, I forget <br/>
Hideyoshi built a castle opposite Odawara. You should take this info <br/>
into account. <br/>
<br/>
All best Mark C</div>
