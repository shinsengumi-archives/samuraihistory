<div id="ygrps-yiv-132586762">Hello!<br/>
<br/>
I've recently signed up with the group, and after lurking for a <br/>
couple of days, I wanted to say Hi.<br/>
<br/>
I have recently been on the hunt for a place where sensible, <br/>
informed discussion can take place. Most of the news groups and <br/>
web-based discussion boards that discuss "Japan" are hopeless. <br/>
They basically seem to be structured flame wars. The few fj. <br/>
newsgroups that deal with history tend to focus on discussions of more <br/>
recent history. So I'm really happy to have stumbled upon this mailing<br/>
 list. I actually found it by visiting the home page of samurai-archiv<br/>
es.com - which I normally don't do, because I usually hit particular p<br/>
ages via web searches.<br/>
<br/>
I am an amateur student of Japanese history. That is to say I don't <br/>
have any particular expertise or academic qualifications on the <br/>
subject - and it also means I have a day job. :)<br/>
<br/>
My interest within Japanese history are pretty wide. I've been <br/>
interested in the late-Bakufu/Meiji Restoration period and the Heian <br/>
Period. Mostly political and military history. These days my focus <br/>
is on the Sengoku Jidai. Particularly I've become fascinated with Oda <br/>
Nobunaga.<br/>
<br/>
I look forward to asking lots of questions on the forum. Maybe <br/>
once in a while I'll be able to answer one, too.<br/>

There is a website, or rather I could say there is the beginnings of <br/>
what might eventually pass for a website some day in the distant <br/>

 </span></blockquote>Hello - and thanks for the kind words about the website. It's very <br/>
amateurish but it's alot of fun for me to work on.<br/>
<br/>
I would indeed be very interested in seeing the info you have on <br/>
Nobuhide on down! For now I've been focusing on the other direction. <br/>
As you know, on my site I've got some narrative about the early <br/>
history of the Oda family, up to about 1400. I am now gathering <br/>
information on the 4-5 generations before Nobunaga (from about 1400 <br/>
onwards).<br/>
<br/>
It's interesting to see that Nobunaga's branch of the family was so <br/>
minor that reliable (independant) records of his direct line are very <br/>
sketchy until you get to Nobuhide. In fact it appears the one cannot <br/>
go much further back than Nobunaga's own great-grandfather, Sukenobu <br/>
(Toshisada as the great-grandfather appears to be incorrect and may <br/>
be part of the false family history created by Nobunaga).<br/>
<br/>
Just out of curiousity have you put Nobunaga as the 2nd or third <br/>
child? Accounts do differ alot.</div>

 </span></blockquote>Haha - no that's ok. Actually I wasn't clear. What I meant is, in <br/>
most accounts we see that Nobuhiro is the oldest son which <br/>
makes Nobunaga the second son (but first son of Nobuhide's <br/>
official wife or "seishitsu" 正室. But some verbal accounts add a <br/>
mystery son, which makes Nobunaga the third son. <br/>
<br/>
So I wasn't really asking about the order per se, but about the <br/>
number of sons.<br/>
<br/>
My guess is that this is based on the fact that Nobunga took the name <br/>
Saburo Nobunaga, which implies he was the third son. But I lean <br/>
towards thinking that there was no mystery older brother (or perhaps <br/>
he died in childbirth or very young).<br/>
<br/>
Thanks again!<br/>
