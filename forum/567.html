<h3>Re: [samuraihistory]</h3>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1852856070">Hi all,<br/>
 Regarding the book 'Shogun' by James Clavell...Is it fiction? Yes, <br/>
basically..It and the storyline that it follows do have parrallels in actual <br/>
events and people involved in those events. Ieyasu Tokugawa was the character <br/>
chosen for the basis of the 'Toranaga' character. And Blackthorne was loosely <br/>
based on the story of the english sailor Will Adams, who was likewise <br/>
stranded in Japan around the end of the Sengoku Jidai and was 'adopted' into <br/>
the Samurai world in a very similar way to that of Blackthorne.<br/>
 Indeed, I heard that when finally Adams was fully 'released' (He was not a <br/>
captive but was held indefinately for the 'use' of the Tokugawa house who saw <br/>
him as a possible way to forge a trade agreement that was not aligned with <br/>
the Religious ideals of the Portuguese and Spanish traders.) And a boat was <br/>
sent to bring to home he actually refused to leave Japan and settled into a <br/>
part of Tokyo (Edo then..) that I believe is still called Anjin-cho in his <br/>
honour!<br/>
 The book follows the same basic line of history as the actual events and the <br/>
names are changed to avoid any problems with the story..It plays out well <br/>
though and can offer the reader an excellent way 'in' to the world of the <br/>
Samurai.<br/>
Enjoy the read!<br/>
 Abayo..<br/>

 </span></blockquote>   Absolutely. University of Hawaii has a very broad Asian History <br/>
program that includes Japanese History, Berkeley and Princeton have  <br/>
good programs, there's one in Chicago that's well known, and others <br/>
around the country. Sometimes they fall under history in college <br/>
programs, sometimes under East Asian culture (I think Harvard does <br/>
this), but there are definitely college course in Japanese history out <br/>
there...<br/>
<br/>
   It does depend on what periods of japanese history you're looking <br/>
for, the general breakdown seemed to be (prehistory thru Sengoku), <br/>
(Sengoku to Meiji), (late Tokugawa to some time in the 29th Century).<br/>
Different schools will have teachers who specialize in different <br/>
periods and aspects within those periods (Dr Mary Berry at Berkeley, <br/>
for example, wrote about Sengoku period Kyoto and the effects of war <br/>
on the culture of its inhabitants). <br/>

Part of me loves it and I owe it a great debt. When I was in college in the<br/>
late 70s I read it, and it is what inspired me to go off and major in<br/>
Japanese history and go to Japan and yada yada yada. After decades of<br/>
studying Japan and writing about it, though, I can no longer read it as the<br/>
mistakes and "that never could have happened that way" events in the book<br/>
just don't work for me any more. I used to read it once a year or so. I<br/>
haven't read it for ten years now.<br/>

between histories like mine and those of Karl Friday, for example, though.<br/>
It's been my experience that most people read my books and Turnbull's, and<br/>
never want to get to the deeper backgrounds that mean academic works like<br/>
"Gates of Power: Monks, Courtiers, and Warriors in Premodern Japan" or<br/>
"Yoritomo and the Founding of the Kamakura Shogunate", both of which are<br/>
replete with quotations and translated source material from primary sources.<br/>
That is something that disappoints me.<br/>

Must concur--super stuff!  I used your Sekigahara book as a guide when I <br/>
walked the Sekigahara battlefield in 1999 during my in-country training as a <br/>
Japan-focused US Army foreign area officer.  It was a lifesaver, especially <br/>
since the local guidebooks and signs are not particularly "gaijin friendly."  <br/>
Your other works are equally helpful, and a pleasure to read.<br/>
<br/>
My MA thesis ended up being about the Japanese 1941-42 Centrifugal Offensive <br/>
in the Southwest Pacific, but I hope to write on the Senkoku Jidai in the <br/>
future.  Wouldn't object to putting together an Osprey book on the Imperial <br/>
Japanese Army in the early 40s (Lord knows I've got more than enough source <br/>
material to do one!), but I suspect there's not much of an English-speaking <br/>
audience for one . . .<br/>
<br/>
Keep on plugging--I can't wait for your thesis or your first academic work to <br/>
come out!<br/>

unfortunately can't get both.  Out of the list you give above, Schama is<br/>
the only exception to the generalization.  While Ambrose was trained as<br/>
a historian, you need to be checking the newspapers more, he is under<br/>
heavy fire for plagiarism and getting his facts screwed up.  I have yet<br/>
to meet any AHA members who liked Massie's books as an ACADEMIC book.<br/>
Maybe they are out there, but I haven't seen them come forward.  The<br/>
same criticisms are leveled at Tuchman and Cantor's recent works.  <br/>

<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1697927883">Not to attack the sacred cow, but Turnbull can definately not be accused of being an acedemic, or a 'true' historian.  Many of his books are filled with small errors and innaccuracies that he very obviously took verbatim from Papinot - although he NEVER mentions Papinot in his sources...  Looking at his books, his information, and his sources together, one has to wonder if he can even read Japanese at all...  <br/>
<br/>
*ahem* for example, Turnbull repeatedly states that the seige of Inabayama took place in 1564/65.  whereas all the sources I have in Japanese, including a few he lists in his bibliography state it happened in 1567.  So you may be thinking, 'what's two or three years?'  Well, what if I told you the battle of Gettysburg took place in 1866?  Oops!<br/>
<br/>
You could write a treatise on just the errors and uncited Papinot sources alone.  Not to mention a picture listed as an 'authors representation' of something that actually looks suspiciously like a tracing of a picture in a Rekishi gunzo book. (Dont have his book or the Gunzo book on hand right now to cite which one)<br/>
Guess because he's the only game in town he thinks he doesn't have to work at it anymore...?  I've seen him mentioned as Stephen "buy my books" Turnbull in some post before, and I can see why.  Just take a look at his website.  You can't help but get the impression scholarship takes a definate backseat to profit.  guess I can't really blame the guy, though.  Gotta put food on the table somehow.<br/>
<br/>
Anyway, I'd rather read 'dry' histories if they are more accurate than 'popular' histories, although I'd prefer to read an accurate popular history! (like A.J. Bryant's stuff!  At least you get the impression that he has a real interest in the subject, and can actually read japanese, and actually puts in the research!)<br/>
<br/>
Oh well, just a rant on my part, and I could very well be totally wrong.</div>

<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://search.ucas.co.uk/cgi-">http://search.ucas.co.uk/cgi-</a><br/>
bin/hsrun.hse/search/cs2002/StateId/SWOF4ceLfru0zjGbsoww_kYWVbiHE-3vJ-<br/>
/HAHTpage/cs2002.Hsindex10.run?r=N&i=N&a=36 It should work all Japan <br/>
courses.  Specific history Im unsure I saw Sheffield does a course my <br/>
friends there she recommends the university.  University of Leeds <br/>
also does a course. Leeds is fantastic my sisters there.  I don't <br/>
know what course is like but the place rocks.  Sorry this is a bit <br/>
off the subject.  Well Takeda Shingen then hmmm.  Oh well back to <br/>
question.  In my opinion I'd forget university and go to Japan as the <br/>
books you get in university are not as good as Japanese books.  Plus <br/>
you can buy the books on the net or whatever.  At Leicester I have <br/>
found about 20 decent books ones hidden away in a dark corner <br/>
including Farris, Friday, jansen, Turnbull- yes but no I avoid, Ooms <br/>
and Sansom-classix etc. Anyway good luck I'd look at ucas and search <br/>
but unless your parents object consider going to Japan and if they do <br/>
well do it anyway if your serious. Also just remembered you gotta go <br/>
to the royal armouries in Leeds it has fantastic bushi exhibits, some <br/>
armour 15 suits, and it emphazises the buke as a horse back archer.  <br/>
I have visited three times spoke to curartor Ian Bottomley who wrote <br/>
book arms and armour of the samurai, nice guy saw bit behind the <br/>
scenes. I took 75 photos that's how damn good it was.  P.S I don't <br/>
live in Leeds just like the place !!! <br/>

<br/>
Massie incidentally also got into deep trouble in the publishing world<br/>
since he was given a very large advance, produced nothing, and was<br/>
threatened with legal action (or maybe taken to court) over the Peter<br/>
the Great volume.  Stunts like this do not endear you with publishers no<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I think the trouble is, there's a *perception* of academic vs. popular. Most<br/>
academic books are no more difficult to read, they just tend to have a tighter<br/>
focus on a specific topic or issue. One is free to ignore the seriously<br/>
academic trappings (usually found in the footnotes, which publishers, fearful<br/>
of the book being deemed "too academic," tend to hide in the back of the book<br/>
and make reading it by academics difficult due to the constant flipping back<br/>
and forth) and just read the book. I don't know anyone who's read "Heavenly<br/>
Warriors" or "Hired Swords" -- two of the best texts on the development of the<br/>
early warrior culture -- who hasn't come away with a deeper understanding of<br/>
the material and where samurai came from and how they developed. Though<br/>
universities use these in upper-level courses in J. history, they are extremely<br/>
accessible.<br/>
<br/>
The same goes for "Gates of Power" and any number of other books. If one is<br/>
interested in a specific area, one should be willing to at least take a look at<br/>
the books before dismissing them.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> > I guess trained historians are interested in such academic<br/>
> books, but I'm just looking for a good story.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>What do you consider a good story? "Hired Swords" is full of interesting<br/>
anecdotes about the evil taxman and how they behaved (I enjoy the quoted letter<br/>
of complaint that talks about how they ride their horses right into people's<br/>
houses... <G>).<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> > So in reply to Mr. Byants<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>No book is interesting unless you crack the cover and take a look inside. I<br/>
have been pleasantly surprised on more than one occasion by a book which, even<br/>
though in my field, I was sure would bore me to tears. There are cases when I<br/>
was right and was bored, but I'm happy to say the ratio is in favor of good.<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>This happens. In fact, I've encountered a bit of... well, difficulty... in some<br/>
areas because of my Osprey books. While they're nothing I'm ashamed of<br/>
(although I really want to redo some of them!), there is a certain perception<br/>
in some areas that I'm not willing to do "academic" work. I'm currently trying<br/>
to disabuse people of these efforts with translations of 14th. century Japanese<br/>
literature and records.<br/>

Kinokuniya or Maruzen and see the wealth of books on Samurai (Rekishi Gunzo<br/>

nonserious) and I sigh that such info simply isn't available in the<br/>
aforementioned writers. For example Imagawa Yoshimoto was a mamas boy and<br/>
his mother practically ran his domain. The Visual Nihon Rekishi Series put<br/>
out by DeAogustini or the similiar Nihonshi by Kodansha or the the Sengoku<br/>
Chronicle give an almost month by month chronicle of the period. I do see<br/>
the arguement that such works wouldn't sell, but even a tenth of this would<br/>
be nice.<br/>

<h3>Inabayama, Lamers and Turnbull</h3>
by <i>kitsuno</i>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1983960221">Well, first, let's take a look at what turnbull says:<br/>
<br/>
"The Samurai, A Military History" (Turnbull, 1977, P. 145):<br/>
"The task of subduing the last of the Saito was entrusted to Toyotomi <br/>
Hideyoshi, who reduced their castle of Inaba-yama (now called Gifu) <br/>
with little difficulty in 1564."<br/>
<br/>
That is all he writes.  He doesn't specifically say that 1564 was the <br/>
end of it, so he leaves it sort of open, which I think is perfectly <br/>
acceptable.<br/>
<br/>
"The Samurai Sourcebook" (Turnbull, 1998, P. 216-217):<br/>
<br/>
"THE SIEGE OF INABAYAMA, 1564- In 1564, Toyotomi Hideyoshi captured <br/>
Inabayama castle from the Saito for Oda Nobunaga.  As Inabayama was <br/>
built on top of a mountain, two attacks were launched, one that <br/>
involved climbing, the other across the river.  Horio Yoshiharu <br/>
distinguished himself by opening the watergate to his atacking <br/>
comrades.  In 1565 Oda Nobunaga made Inabayama his headquarters and <br/>
renamed it Gifu."<br/>
<br/>
Turnbull plainly states it was renamed Gifu in 1565.  In 20 minutes of <br/>
research in my collection of Japanese language history books, I found <br/>
six books that contradict this.  The rest either didn't mention the <br/>
siege at all, or didn't put any dates to it.<br/>
<br/>
1. Nihon meijo Souran (1999, P. 441):<br/>
"1567 - Oda nobunaga attacks saito tatsuoki's Inabayama castle in <br/>
Mino.  [It] falls, and is renamed Gifu."<br/>
<br/>
2. Sengokushi Shimbun (1996, P. 109):<br/>
states that in 9/1567 nobunaga takes Inabayama, renames it 'Gifu', and <br/>
changes his seal to 'Tenka Fubu'.<br/>
<br/>
3. Sengoku no Kassen (1998, P. 78):<br/>
On the top of the page it states "Eiroku 10 [1567]", and the title of <br/>
the section is: "Nobunaga takes Mino - The seige of Inabayama".<br/>
<br/>
4. Nihon no Eiyu 100nin (1998, P. 73):<br/>
states that in Eiroku 10 [1567], Nobunaga defeats tatsuoki, and makes <br/>
Inabayama his main base, and renames it Gifu, and changes his seal to <br/>
Tenka Fubu.<br/>
<br/>
5. Rekishi Gunzo #1 (1987, P. 99) [Turnbull cites this book]:<br/>
In the timeline, for Eiroku 10, 8th month, it states that saito <br/>
tatsuoki is defeated, and Inabayama falls.  Inabayama is changed to <br/>
'Gifu'.  Again, Turnbull cites this. I would assume if he had <br/>
contradictory information he would normally have stated something like <br/>
"scholars disagree as to whether the fall of Inabayama took place in <br/>
1565 or 1567."  He doesn't mention it.  Maybe in his next book.<br/>
<br/>
6. Sengoku Jinbutsu 700 (2001, P. 106):<br/>
Eiroku 10 [1567] Nobunaga renames castle Gifu, and changes his seal to <br/>
'Tenka Fubu'.<br/>
<br/>
Based on the above, I'd have to go with Lamers -it appears that it is <br/>
common knowledge that the final fall of Inabayama was 1567.  Granted, <br/>
most of the above are secondary sources, and could be considered <br/>
'popular history', I would tend to believe them over turnbull due to <br/>
the fact that not only do 6 sources state that the 'final' fall of <br/>
Inabayama was 1567 and at that point was renamed Gifu, but also that <br/>
the Japanese authors probably have access to much more accurate <br/>
information.  Another thing I notice is that Hideyoshi was not <br/>
mentioned in a single source as having participated.  Not to say that <br/>
he didn't, just that no sources mention him at all.  Sure, there could <br/>
have been plenty of attacks on Inabayama in 1564/5, but if it didn't <br/>
fall until 1567, that makes the 1564/65 battles almost <br/>
inconsequential.<br/>
<br/>
For the above reason, I just find it odd that after 20 years of <br/>
'research', Turnbull still states that Inabayama fell in 1564/5.  It <br/>
would be nice to know where Turnbull got his info, but his being <br/>
'popular history', it doesn't precisely cite.  Sure, he could be <br/>
correct, and the Japanese sources not, but.....<br/>
<br/>
There are other various things Turnbull puts in that don't match up, <br/>
some of which came from Papinot, which he conveniently doesn't cite, <br/>
but obviously took greatly from.  Could be fun picking it apart, <br/>
although I don't see what purpose it would serve.  Maybe to make him a <br/>
better historian?  Or at least to more clearly cite his sources to <br/>
prove us wrong?<br/>
<br/>
All in good fun, of course.</div>

However, if you like the style, you will probably like Musashi,  <br/>

The first three are translations of Eiji Yoshikawa's Japanese versions.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-2043671975">Hello:<br/>
<br/>
I liked "Shogun" too, so I saw the series (avalaible in DVD) with Richard Chamberlain as Anjin. Toshiro Mifune as Tokugawa (Toronaga? Somebody could explain me this changes in the names). I found that the TV version is pretty faithfull to the Clavell's story. By the same, both of them has the same merits and problems. <br/>
I also recommend Yoshikawa's works, but be prepaired. I do not if it is the original or the transaltion, but the narrative style is pretty hard and rude. Not like Clavell's (I am not saying that Clavell was superb in that terms). On the other hand, is a real japanese who writes, so there is a pretty much trustfull characterization of the japanese ways.<br/>
There are two ways to be be shogun. One is to be appointed by the emperor on such position, understanding that no other Shogun is in office. Of course, a warlord supported by large posessions and being far over any other lord in terms of power, could get such appointment without problem, if he wanted it. But also, tradition tells that only the members of two ancient families, the Fujiwara and Minamoto, could become Shogun.Tokugawa claimed blood links to this families, although evidence is questionable.<br/>
The second is to be heir of a previous Shogun.<br/>
The Shogun is intended to be the military governor of Japan. So, in the practice, his power is absolute. The Emperor was only a symbolic figure, just like today more or less.<br/>
So far, here there are lots of people that knows a lot more about this than me, so forgive me if I made a mistake.<br/>

 I'm into Japanese History and have been reading a book called 'Shogun' <br/>
 by James Clavel.<br/>
 <br/>
 It made me wonder how exactly a daiymo became a shogun, what power he <br/>
 had and how he was in relation to the Emperor.<br/>
 <br/>
 Thanks, Please give me some information. A few links maybe and could <br/>
 anyone recommend any other Ancient Japanese books?<br/>
