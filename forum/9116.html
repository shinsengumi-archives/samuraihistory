 </span></blockquote>Dear Fodder -<br/>
During my breif time in Japan I do not recall ever seeing quality <br/>
replicas of Chokuto. However there were Chokuto submitted for the <br/>
Shinsakuto competitions, those I am afraid might cost you as much as <br/>
the originals. Still if you have to have one I would look to the modern <br/>
swordmakers,<br/>

350$ and it is well worth my money  it holds a NICE edge & will flex <br/>
over 3" before bending but its not like a cheap replica you have to <br/>
take care of it lol and just a warning fingerprints left on it <br/>
overnight WILL stay on it forever (its like rust)</div>
