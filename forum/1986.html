I'm about to undertake a coursework project at school and was <br/>

My teacher has asked me to see if I can focus on William Adams and <br/>

<br/>
If you look at the archive of recent messages you will<br/>
see during June Adams was discussed as well as a small<br/>
discussion about a book regarding him and the<br/>
differences/similarities between will adams and<br/>
Blackthorne from Shogun<br/>

<h3>Re: [samuraihistory] Coursework Questions?</h3>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1542547739">Vince:<br/>
<br/>
Here are a few from the hip<br/>
:<br/>
<br/>
1.  <br/>
Why did the supposedly xenophobic Tokugawa Ieyasu accept Adams and keep him <br/>
around?  How did his presence in Japan shape future Japanese political and <br/>
relations with Europe, especially Catholic Europe?  <br/>
<br/>
2.  Was Adams directly or indirectly an influence in Ieyasu's later decision <br/>
to refuse foreigners access to any part of Japan apart from the trading town <br/>
of Dejima, near Nagasaki?<br/>
<br/>
3.  How (if at all) did Adams' knowledge help Ieyasu in his domestic efforts <br/>
to unify Japan under a Tokugawa shogunate?<br/>
<br/>
4.  Having been exposed to modern European shipbuilding and gunsmithing <br/>
techniques by Adams and other late 16th/early 17th Century Europeans, why did Japan <br/>
not modernize for another three centuries?  Were they incapable (either <br/>
through lack of skills or lack of natural resources), or was this a consious <br/>
choice?  Either way, what was the practical effect for Japan, internationally and <br/>
domestically, of failing to modernize?<br/>
<br/>
Hope these are helpful.  The first two are pretty simple "historical fact" <br/>
questions, while the last two could provide fuel for some good debate among <br/>
folks who have done a bit of prior study on Japanese history.<br/>
<br/>
Perhaps some other listeros could refine or shred these.<br/>
<br/>
Cordially,<br/>
Patrick Howard<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1501568775">Umm the film Shogun was made based on William Adams, so it might provide extra source material.  Offhand, i think that you could examine what sort of problems William Adams might have had fitting into such a different culture, and also what the similarities might have been - the UK was also pretty fuedal - tho not to the same extent. He might have looked for similarities between the cultures in order to start finding his way as it were. Hope this helps. Email me back if you need more help.  Laura<br/>
