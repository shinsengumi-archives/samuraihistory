	Save your money and join a group like this; www.To-ken.com<br/>
where you can see and hold in hand collector-worthy blades each month  <br/>
at the regular meetings. If you must, spend a few bills on an  <br/>
introductory text or two here:japaneseswordbooks.com<br/>
  Put 200 pounds in the bank a few years in a row and then you could  <br/>
maybe purchase a real quality piece that will only increase in value  <br/>
here; www.nihonto.com or better yet travel to Japan where there are  <br/>
oodles of fine swords and with the right knowledge you could save  <br/>
yourself 300 pounds here and there on the purchase of something you  <br/>
can be proud of.<br/>
	The sword world is not a place to go cheap, you'll only make the  <br/>
wrong guys rich, waste your own money and maybe even wind up hating  <br/>
the swords, which is a shame since a well made nihonto is truly a  <br/>
thing to behold.<br/>
	I encourage you to look around a lot more before you buy Paul Chen  <br/>
or any other replica pieces, they will never be collectible. Check  <br/>

 </span></blockquote>Being a specialist in Nihonto, I can recommend some places.  You <br/>
could try centuryfitness.com, they have a new signature sword <br/>
collection, and since it is in dollars it would be pretty cheap in <br/>
pounds.  Also, I would give Bugei.com a try.  Be warned about <br/>
century though, their swords are not traditionally forged.</div>
