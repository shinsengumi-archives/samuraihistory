<h3>Rashomon</h3>

<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-2038005638">A remastered 'Rashomon' is finally coming out on DVD - with a running <br/>
commentary track by the guy who did the comentary for the 7 Samurai (I <br/>
 assume) - the commentary for 7 samurai was the best I've seen aside <br/>
from 'Das Boot'.  It is part of the 'criterion collection', and they <br/>
did such a good job with 7 samurai, I already have my order in for <br/>
Rashomon. (as opposed to the DVD 'Ran', which was an utter <br/>
abomination)  Rashomon will be released on 3-26 - you can check it out <br/>
at dvdplanet.com.  You'll have to do a search to find it - it doesn't <br/>
put the location of the page in my browser's address bar to post here.<br/>
<br/>
Looks like it will have Japanese/subtitled or a dubb track. Never seen <br/>
it dubbed.  I assume it will be horrible, but interesting to watch at <br/>
least once.</div>
