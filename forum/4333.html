<h3>questions on komon</h3>
by <i>cepooooo</i>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-686728380">A freind of mine is wondering...<br/>
<br/>
... a few question about the Ka-Mon<br/>
(Japanese family crest).  I wanted to know how the inheritance of the<br/>
Ka-mon is carried out.  For instance, when people get married whose<br/>
crest do they take, the bride or groom?  Are all the children in the<br/>
family entitled to it?  And, did inheritance guidelines change over<br/>
time for the crest, for instance, at one point only first born boys<br/>
were entitled to inheritance?<br/>
<br/>
Can anybody help her???<br/>
<br/>
thanx a lot<br/>
