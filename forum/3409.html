<h3>Shimabara Rebellion</h3>
by <i>twheels2many</i>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1373759497">Hey all<br/>
<br/>
Just wanted to say I enjoyed the conversation Carmen's message prompted (Well, most of it. <br/>
Some of it was kind of antagonistic, but whatever). I'm researching the Shimabara Rebellion, <br/>
particularly in regard to the interaction between the samurai's lifestyle/beliefs and his newfound <br/>
Christian faith. Sort of comparable, I suppose, to the Roman Legionnaires that converted in the <br/>
3rd century (before Xianity was legal in Rome). I'm trying to find out to what extent the rebellion <br/>
was religiously motivated, and how they justified their rebellion (what was the 17th century <br/>
Japanese Christian's "Just War Theory" - or something along those lines). And just all kinds of <br/>
general stuff... like what were the common misconceptions of Christianity that the anti-<br/>
Christian Japanese had. (The Romans thought they were atheists and cannibals). And to what <br/>
extent was the oppression that prompted the rebellion religiously motivated versus nationally <br/>
motivated (anti the religion versus anti the foreigners... in defense of Japanese religion versus <br/>
in defense of governmental Japan... though there's probably a mix of all these motivations...) <br/>
What role did the Jesuits play in the rebellion? Etc, etc...<br/>
<br/>
Which, anybody that has suggestions for books to read that deal with these ideas or <br/>
particularly the Shimabara Rebellion, I'd love your suggestions. Just started researching the <br/>
topic, so I'm pretty ignorant of the details. Found some websites, but don't know the good <br/>
books to read. Anything I get I'll have to order, since my bookstore carries NADA dealing with <br/>
Japanese history.<br/>

<br/>
 I good book to start with his George Elison's Dues Destroyed. It describes<br/>
how christianity was "translated" in Japan; how Christian concepts were<br/>
interpreted in a "Buddhist" fashion.<br/>
<br/>
As for the Shimabara rebellion, the most detailed work in English may be in<br/>
Ivan Morris's Nobility of Failure.</div>
