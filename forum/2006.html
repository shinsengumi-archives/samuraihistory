warfare but does anyone know if they were ever used in the field?<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1815112399">The cannon was introduced to Japan in 1576, but was never used <br/>
effectively against castles, due to the low levels of casting and <br/>
gunnery skill available in Japan at the time. Cannons were hardly, <br/>
if ever, used until Japan never made there own, in the 1850s. In the <br/>
1850s Japan successfully created western-style reverbatory furnaces, <br/>
which led them to create there own cannons.<br/>
