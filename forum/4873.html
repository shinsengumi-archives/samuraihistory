<h3>Era names and dates tidbit</h3>
by <i>kitsuno</i>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1421608740">This is a totally esoteric piece of info that probably very few <br/>
people would have any interest in, but I discovered it, so I'm <br/>
sharin'!  <br/>
<br/>
I happened to be looking at one of the stone lanterns that you find <br/>
all over every corner of Japan, and this one happened to be on an <br/>
island off the coast of Oita prefecture.  Since the era name and date <br/>
was still clear I made a note out of it out of curiosity just to see <br/>
how old the thing was.  It was marked "Jokyou 5".  So I went to my <br/>
computer, used my handy-dandy era converter, and lo and behold, <br/>
the "Jokyo" era ended in the 4th year.  There was no "Jokyou 5"!  <br/>
Jokyo ended in the 4th year - 1687, and 1688 was the first year of <br/>
Genroku.  So I was perplexed, and I asked around.  The answer was <br/>
actually quite simple - islanders and other people in isolated <br/>
vilages sometimes went 2 or 3 years before getting word that the era <br/>
had changed, and so during that time any headstones or stone lamps or <br/>
torii gates or other stone monuments that were created would be dated <br/>
in the era the villagers THOUGHT it was.  So they apparently hadnt <br/>
gotten word that the Jokyou era had ended and the Genroku era had <br/>
began.  <br/>
<br/>
Just an interesting (well, I thought so, anyway) tidbit I came across <br/>
during my travels.</div>

 </span></blockquote>Yes, there was. Genroku 1 was proclaimed on the 30th day of the ninth month of <br/>
Jokyo 5. Everything up to that date was Jokyo 5. Everything after it was Genroku 1.<br/>
<br/>
When the last emperor died in 1989, you know 1989 was still the Shôwa Era -- and <br/>
a few weeks later it became Heisei 1.<br/>
<br/>
Surely you don't think that eras change at midnight on Dec. 31. :)<br/>

discussion with some friends, wherein we hypothesised that this might be<br/>
the case, but we had zero proof, so we shrugged and moved on. It's nice<br/>
to have the evidence, thanks.<br/>

<br/>
That seems pretty straight forward in itself, but in a period when the<br/>
fastest forms of communication was a ship or a horse, surely there must<br/>
have been some kind of time lag, relative to the propagation rate of the<br/>
news? Obviously the closer you are to the centres of power, the more up<br/>
to date your calendar, but if you're out in the sticks/mountains/islands<br/>
etc...?<br/>

 </span></blockquote>That wouldn't surprise me at all -- It took how many days for the US as a whole <br/>
to find out about Lincoln's assassination? -- but at the heart of that issue was <br/>
a more basic question -- that there was, indeed, a Jokyô 5 -- for almost ten <br/>
months.<br/>
<br/>
It was the same question that was driving everyone crazy in Japan in 1989, when <br/>
Shôwa died (and before, when he was failing and people knew he would be dead <br/>
soon). The government nearly ground to a halt as people were putting off <br/>
ordering (and designing!) all new government forms that would have to have a NEW <br/>
era name in a checkbox (for birthdates, registrations, etc.), and had no idea <br/>
what the name was going to be, or when it was actually going to happen. New <br/>
calendars needed to be printed, etc. Yeah, it was still Shôwa 65, but it was <br/>
about to become something else, too. :)<br/>
