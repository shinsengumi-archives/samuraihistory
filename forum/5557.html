<h3>internment camps of WWII</h3>
by <i>falconstar16</i>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-355609139">i hope i can ask this clearly.<br/>
Most of you know the Internment camp stories of WWII. Where the JA <br/>
(japanese american) citizens of the US were detained in "camps".  <br/>
I'm specifically looking for information concerning the JA <br/>
Individuals that were taken just prior to the announcement (and <br/>
enforcement) of the internment camp mandate. If what has been told <br/>
to me is true, these individuals (held in N. Dakota) would be <br/>
the "last" samurai derived of the Satsuma Reb.  I'm specifically <br/>
looking into a family history which has been held in secret till <br/>
2002. So any information would help.  Thank you.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>I'm sorry. I'm trying to learn the post-1865 samurai history mostly <br/>
concerned with the Japanese American imigrants to the US. I believe <br/>
the "last" samurai comment is a vague area. I'll explain.<br/>
  Known facts :1877 Satsuma led by Saigo Takamori attack Kumamoto <br/>
Castle. US tries peace agreements prior to attack.<br/>
  I understand up to this point.(well documented) <br/>
I'm trying to find if the US govt took samarai family names<br/>
(hereditary) + first names of all children in family at this time. <br/>
Then..fast fwd.. to 1941-42 WWII.  Prior to Roosevelt's Ex. Order <br/>
9066 (forced internment) there were JA men who were "arrested/taken" <br/>
away. No charge against..no explaination(which i want to find). <br/>
These men were taken to North Dakota. As I have been told these men <br/>
in North Dakota(not sure how many) were all either present or family <br/>
were present at the time of Satsuma reb. 1877 and were on the side <br/>
of the Imp. Army?? fighting the Satsuma clan. Which makes sense to <br/>
me on the US side to see Samurai in US but loyal to fight for <br/>
Meiji.  But please correct me if my history is in err.  <br/>
 So i'm looking for any information about this.  And from my <br/>
understanding most of this information was held in both govt. and <br/>
samurai family secret until ?late 70's?.  <br/>
  All this information should provide me with the answer to "The <br/>
Fastest Hands in Japan"--quoted from a dying 96 yr old man. born 1870</div>

	It is well known that a group of Aizu samurai immigrated to the US <br/>
after being defeated in the restoration wars. Is it possible that this <br/>
is the group your are thinking of? They settled in California and hard <br/>
a very hard time of it.<br/>
	While your story sounds unlikely to me, the one place I would go with <br/>
such questions is the Japanese American History Archive; <br/>

I wish I could explain in detail to how far my great grandfather hid <br/>
his samurai past. But in any case, my time is limited in trying to <br/>
find his family name before his own kids(my grandma/siblings) pass <br/>
away.  See he wouldn't even tell them.  Only one son knew about his <br/>
past and wouldn't talk about it till 2000.  One hundred years after <br/>
he came to america.  Either by old age or never being told the <br/>
family name isn't known.  So my search will go on... thank you for <br/>
your help.<br/>
