The June updates are mostly done at the Electronic Journals of Martial<br/>
Arts and Sciences <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://ejmas.com/">http://ejmas.com/</a> and you can check out the new articles<br/>
at <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://ejmas.com/thismonth.html">http://ejmas.com/thismonth.html</a><br/>
<br/>
Some pretty good items this month once again, I'm always amazed at what<br/>
our editors and writers (who are all volunteers) manage to pull together<br/>
for you.<br/>
<br/>
When you click through to the site you may encounter a bit of sluggishness<br/>
once in a while. This is because there's been a major denial of service<br/>
attack going on against a few big ISPs and our host servers are included<br/>
in the fun. They've upgraded and the site is running but you may hit the<br/>
occasional hiccup. Just reload your page and be a little patient and<br/>
you'll get where you're going. We designed the site for high transfer<br/>
rates and low "bells and whistles" so it seems to be OK so far.<br/>
<br/>
Any graphic designers out there want to work on a small project each<br/>
month? If so drop me a line, I've got an idea that may be some fun.<br/>
<br/>
Don't forget to check out the EJMAS site itself, lots of archived material<br/>
to dig through with 8 publications and an encyclopedia. If you're<br/>
researching in the martial arts I highly recommend checking us out first.<br/>
<br/>
And don't forget please that all of this is free for your use. Do help us<br/>
keep it up by perhaps clicking on the tips jar while reading an especially<br/>
good article, or visiting one of our sponsors who help us pay the<br/>
bills. You may be able to buy your next piece of equipment cheaper down at<br/>
the dollar store but those guys aren't spending several hours every month<br/>
making sure you've got your regular fix of entertainment and education now<br/>
are they?<br/>
<br/>
There are seminars in July on both the east and west coasts of North<br/>
America sponsored by EJMAS so check them out from the main page<br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://ejmas.com/">http://ejmas.com/</a> You'll find some good instruction there too.<br/>
<br/>
Once more, I'd like to invite everyone to copy this email to any person or<br/>
list you think would welcome it.<br/>
