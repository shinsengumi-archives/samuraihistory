I don't know the answer to your question.  However, how deeply are you (or<br/>
anyone else) interested in Japanese matchlock guns??  If you actually want<br/>
BOOKS I can list a very few English sources, if you want Japanese sources I<br/>
have an older English article that lists quite a few...<br/>

I think the author of "Giving up the gun" was Stephen Turnbull.<br/>

 </span></blockquote> Noel Perrin wrote "Giving up the Gun", and you can<br/>
find it on Amazon.com. I'm not a fan of the book<br/>
myself, I disagree with a lot of his conclusions. <br/>
<br/>
Could a samurai warrior<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> > use firearms on the field of battle in any time in<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Well, guns were really only introduced in the<br/>
mid-1500's, 1542 for portuguese firearms and somewhat<br/>
earlier for chinese models. Rather than "losing<br/>
honor", they were quickly used to "win battles" by<br/>
most daimyo. Granted, the use was mainly relegated to<br/>
ashigaru troops, but many important daimyo also<br/>
practised with arquebuses, including Oda Nobunaga and<br/>
Tokugawa Ieyasu. Ieyasu was considered a better shot<br/>
than most of his retainers. <br/>
<br/>
 As Perrin's book will tell you, the gun was phased<br/>
out and the samurai sword mystique was<br/>
created...whether it was part of a Tokugawa bakufu<br/>
plot or not, I'll leave up to you. Keep in mind that<br/>
there was no open warfare for over 200 years, so what<br/>
was the use of guns? Samurai did not hesitate to use<br/>
them during the civil war. <br/>

 </span></blockquote>n their history, without loss of honor? <br/>
<br/>
If I might offer a personal opinion I think the short answer to this is 'ye=<br/>
s'. Tokugawa Ieyasu himself was <br/>
apparently a good shot (as much as it was possible to be) - but even if not=<br/>
, he took time to learn how to use <br/>
the weapon and if it was OK by him it would have been okay by everyone. Com=<br/>
bat samurai (pre 1600) were <br/>
far more pragmatic than the image we have today, and samurai honour, as a c=<br/>
ode that was lived rather than <br/>
paid lip-service, reached its lowest ebb just prior to the emergence of the=<br/>
 Oda/Hideyoshi/Tokugawa <br/>
triumvirate. In those days anything went, as long as you won. The emergence=<br/>
 of strong leaders and a unified <br/>
country probably did most to bring about a restructuring of the warrior eth=<br/>
ic. The later Edo Jidai under <br/>
Tokugawa rule completely remodelled the ideals of the samurai, and that is =<br/>
the image commonly held today.<br/>
<br/>
There are pictures of samurai using firearms (although not many tales), but=<br/>
 I think the honour ethic (which <br/>
existed as the exception, rather than the rule) was primarily based on the =<br/>
samurai's traditional weapons. The <br/>
problem with firearms is that the early models only really worked when used=<br/>
 en masse which made up for their <br/>
inaccuracy, and a skilled individual warrior would have felt safer with a w=<br/>
eapon he could rely on, and you could <br/>
not really rely on an arquebus. Especially when battlefields often develope=<br/>
d into chaotic close combat mel√©es.<br/>
<br/>
If a samurai wanted to make a name for himself on the battlefield, the spea=<br/>
r was the thing.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-140681337">samurais as we konw them now are different than the ones during the sengoku jidai, sure honor was always present but how to beat the enemy was the primary concern, some see using guns as contemptous while others embrace it as a ways to attain victory(ex. ieyasu and nobunaga)...the "hagakure" was written after the sengoku jidai, so all im trying to point out is that samurais are great swordsmen but not all of them have the sense of honor as how we perceive all samurai today, some are even downright dishonorable in their actions, but if there is a samurai that i would say as a perfect model for the samurais code of honor during the sengoku jidai i would vote for II Naomasa, the red devil of hikon...my 2 kokus</div>
