       Could anyone e-mail me with information on collections of samurai<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1892201419">Hi Ray,<br/>
<br/>
The Leeds Armouries have an excellent display of Japanese arms and armour,<br/>
an advantage over many places is that photography is permitted. It is quite<br/>
easy to spend two/three hours in the oriental gallery on its own let alone<br/>
the rest of the building - so allocate the full day to a visit.  Another<br/>
place well worth the visit, although not in the same league, is Snowshill<br/>
Manor in Broadway. They have a room with twenty or so suits of samurai<br/>
armour in display/diorama. I was there several years ago about the time it<br/>
was going through a refurbishment. It is a National Trust building so you<br/>
can obtain more info there.<br/>
<br/>
I visited the Museum in Glasgow in 2000, they have four suits of Samurai<br/>
Armour if memory serves!  It may be that several other provincial museums<br/>
have some bits so its worth dropping in when passing!! I caught a great<br/>
exhibition a few years back at the Rochester Museum in Kent (which was so<br/>
out of the way).<br/>
<br/>
The London collections I believe have all gone to make up the Leeds<br/>
Armouries.<br/>
<br/>
If I think of others I will mail again..<br/>
<br/>
Regards,<br/>
                    Rod Johnson<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1263151242">Hi<br/>
<br/>
The armouries has at least 10 full sets of high<br/>
quality armour on dispaly. also several swords and a<br/>
collections of matching Yari which were given to queen<br/>
victoria.<br/>
<br/>
In the main hall of oriental arms there is a figure<br/>
ona horse displayed in Yabusame fittings. Also a<br/>
crossbow which has a Tokugawa mon on it.<br/>
<br/>
One of the armours is the one given to King James 1st<br/>
by one of the Tokugawa shogun, nad another which they<br/>
believe was given to the UK Ambasador who was sent to<br/>
collect this armour. This ambassador was met by<br/>
William Adams.<br/>
<br/>
I took over 300 photos of the collection during the<br/>
several visits I made last year and this year. If you<br/>
want I can email a few of the different armour on<br/>
display. I think they also have a temp display on <br/>
armour making.<br/>
<br/>
The best part is the Royal Armouries is now free to<br/>
visit. Check out in advance what they have each day<br/>
for public displays. They sometimes have someone<br/>
showing how to put on Japanese.<br/>
<br/>
Nottingham castle museum has a collection of armour<br/>
but this is still boxed up.they have told me they<br/>
indetn on cataloging it later this year and may put up<br/>
a temp display of the several sets that they have<br/>

                    Are you aware that Queen Elizabeth I was sent a suite of <br/>
samurai armour as a gift from the Shogun at that time, I will look up my <br/>
references (MONUMENTA NIPPONICA) and publish additional information.<br/>

     My computer has been down,but I am pleased to say is now back to normal.<br/>
     I plan to visit the Royal Armouries at Leeds on Sunday the 12th May with a few <br/>
     friends as there is also a model painting competition being held there.The entry<br/>
     fee is £2.50 to the show and as a wargamer hope to pick-up some usefull hints<br/>
     on painting figures and there may-be some traders there.<br/>
     I also plan to take some photos of the suits of armour and weapons of the samurai.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1440592651">Hi Ray<br/>
<br/>
I shall be at the Leeds Armouries Event on 12th May representing North Herts<br/>
Scale Model Club - and probably displaying some of my samurai figures and<br/>
perhaps some stuff from Shogun Arbeitsgruppe. Look out for me there and we<br/>
can have a chat... If anyone else is attending from SamuraiHistory Group<br/>
perhaps we can all meet for a light refreshment [the place is near<br/>
Tetley's!!]. Let me know who to look out for...<br/>
<br/>
Trevor Dixon (Dixon Miniatures - 25mm Samurai) may be there, I haven't<br/>
spoken to him about the show yet. Make sure you check out the new range of<br/>
54mm Samurai by Irregular Miniatures too.<br/>
As an aside I am sure that Stephen Turnbull will be there also..... any<br/>
questions or comments to pass on? {and be realistic!!}.....<br/>
