<div id="ygrps-yiv-1937427225">Around 1530s is the last period in which Hosokawa clan had a strong <br/>
power.Soon after their retainer Miyoshi had a power,They became <br/>
weaker and weaker.<br/>
They had holdings of Sanuki,Tosa,Awaji,Settsu,Izumi,Awaji,Tanba and <br/>
Bicchu around this period.And among them, the Souke(I don't know its <br/>
English Equivalent,Prime family?The master of it was appointed <br/>
Kanrei) had Sanuki,Tosa,Settsu,Izumi and Tanba.<br/>
So It can be said their fiefs was around Osaka Bay, Setouchi sea and <br/>
Shikoku region.<br/>
<br/>
Hope<br/>
