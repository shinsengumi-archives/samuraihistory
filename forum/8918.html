<h3>Samurai Fiction 2007 - more info</h3>
by <i>kitsuno</i>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-145596458">A little more info for the third annual "Samurai Fiction" contest - I <br/>
am still working out the new rules, although there won't be a <br/>
tremendous amount of changes from last year.  <br/>
<br/>
One new development:<br/>
<br/>
For every 5 entries, I will add $50 to the total winnings. So, the <br/>
more entries, the much higher the potential winnings.  And don't <br/>
forget, the sooner you sign up, the less you will have to pay for the <br/>
entrance fee.<br/>
<br/>
When I finish the website for the new contest, I'll post it here.</div>
