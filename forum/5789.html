<h3>looking for plans for Samurai house</h3>
by <i>Allison</i>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1223840542">Hello Samurai Historians,<br/>
<br/>
I am a homeschooling Mom looking for some specific resources re: Samurai <br/>
history. Thanks for the great information on this list!<br/>
<br/>
My son (11) is quite interested in this subject and would like to build his <br/>
own miniature "Samurai House".<br/>
<br/>
What I am looking for are diagrams, pictures, drawings, floor plans, etc. <br/>
of what might be considered a typical Samurai House. I realize that in <br/>
history, most things are rarely "typical" ! Again, this is for a homeschool <br/>
project, and I have searched the internet many times and really don't know <br/>
quite how to get the info I'm looking for.<br/>
<br/>
Any clues?<br/>
<br/>
Thanks,<br/>
<br/>
Allison</div>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1053142472">There are a lot of books that deal with this, but one of the earliest,<br/>
"Japanese Homes and Their Surroundings," by Edward S. Morse,<br/>
originally published in 1895, is still one of the best. Profusely<br/>
illustrated by his own drawings, plenty of details of many types of<br/>
traditional Japanese dwellings in great detail. Morse was an<br/>
incredible observer and very competent draftsman with a wonderful eye<br/>
for detail.<br/>
<br/>
Fortunately this book is available in a fairly inexpensive Dover<br/>
reprint edition that should do well for your son's purposes.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-303913663">I'm in my uni library writing an essay about japanese history when i <br/>
received this post. It's the sort of thing I'm interested in so I <br/>
checked the library catalogue and found a copy of it. Imagine my <br/>
delight when I discover a 1888 4th edition sitting here in pretty <br/>
good condition. Mayhaps the library will be one less book soon ;)<br/>
