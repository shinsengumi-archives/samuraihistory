<h3>New and question</h3>

<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1265070557">Hello all, I'm new to the group.  I have been looking through <br/>
somethings and have a question.  I don't think this has been asked but <br/>
I could be wrong.  What did the samurai do for entertainment?  I <br/>
understand plays, writing, poetry, and training.  However, these <br/>
contrast in some ways with the character of a warrior culture.  Is <br/>
there anything else they would have used to be entertaied?  Shogi, for <br/>
instance, or something of this nature would make sense.  It is <br/>
essentially chess.  However, the reason I ask is that an archaeologist <br/>
once said to understand a culture look at how they entertained <br/>
themselves.</div>

 </span></blockquote>Since Japan's samurai class was a social class with many different <br/>
levels, entertainment varied but associating poetry or writing with <br/>
being a sissy is a silly modern American thought. Lord Byron has a <br/>
statue in Greece erected to him not because he was a great poet but <br/>
because he helped liberate Greece from the Turks. Musashi wrote books <br/>
and was an excellent painter. Etc. Etc.<br/>

womanizing, and gambling: I don't view these as war like <br/>
entertainment because all males participate.  I'm sure wealth <br/>
merchants endulged as much if not more then the samurai.</div>

think is it more of an overall cultural bias that permeates all parts of <br/>
a society?<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> >     With that said, I asked what was their choice of<br/>

 </span></blockquote>??? The Republican Romans trained far more than the Samurai ever did in <br/>
  and frankly in a melee of 100 Romans versus 100 Samurai, I would bet <br/>
on the Romans. The Romans for a long time were a soldier culture which <br/>
basically kicked butt on most of the surrounding warrior cultures.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> > Yet, they didn't relish in bloodshed as much as their Roman counterparts. <br/>

 </span></blockquote>Nice sword looking Ichitaro, how does it cut? I don't know, here comes a <br/>
peasant, lets try it on him. Oh, another peasant rebellion, just kill <br/>
them all.<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Mysteriously until the Edo period, war was a sport that all males could <br/>
participate in if they wanted to advance their class. Who's that monkey guy?<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1296466393"><blockquote><span title="ireply">>Lastly, samurais were warriors. <br/>
 <br/>
 </span></blockquote>Not always. "Samurai" is a broad term that encompasses far too long a<br/>
time period to make a statement <br/>
like that. Even in the 16th century (which is the period I assume you<br/>
are referring too) not all samurai were <br/>
warriors. Samurai were social elites, and during the numerous wars of<br/>
the the century that often saw them <br/>
leading men on battlefields, but some samurai were far more useful as<br/>
administrators and would have rarely <br/>
wielded a bow or yari in combat.<br/>
 <br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> >Unlike Rome, the samurai, in particular before the edo period, prepared<br/>

<blockquote><span title="ireply"> >measured more byprowess in combat. <br/>
 <br/>
 </span></blockquote>While my knowledge of Roman history isn't great, I doubt that this is<br/>
true. During Rome's Golden Age their<br/>
legions were famously well trained and disciplined. And again, not all<br/>
samurai prepared for war constantly,<br/>
nor were they all necessarily particularly good at it.<br/>
 <br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> >Yet, they didn't relish in bloodshed as much as their Roman<br/>

<blockquote><span title="ireply"> >all males participate. I'm sure wealth merchants endulged as much if<br/>
 </span></blockquote>not more then the samurai.<br/>
 <br/>
The samurai were social elites. They drank, womanized, gambled, and all<br/>
the rest of those "base" activities. <br/>
Some practiced archery and swordsmanship, others wrote poetry, performed<br/>
plays, painted, went hawking, <br/>
and did whatever was expected of their social status.<br/>

concept of "dancing", it's sort of "poetic drama", and he was probably<br/>
using the theme of atsumori to admit his mortality (lots of discussion<br/>
between a priest and dead warriors). And so it wouldn't have been for<br/>
"entertainment". Probably more of an "eat, drink, and be merry, for<br/>
tomorrow we all shall die" type statement, minus the drinking and<br/>
merryment.</div>

<br/>
Shogi would be closer to Chinese Chess and Western Chess, if one were looking for relationships between games.  All three have horses (with different movement rules), all three have rook-like pieces (the shogi piece only advancing forward until promoted), all three have pawns (all with different post-promotion rules), Chinese Chess and Shogi have no queen, all three games have (a) piece(s) that can move diagonally, ... one cool thing about shogi is that when you eat an opponents piece, you can then use it as your piece (with rules on how to place it on the board.)<br/>

Lastly, samurais were warriors. Japan, of this time, was under a feudal system. In a feudal society, warriors always maintain the highest rung in society. With that said, I asked what was their choice of entertainment. Within that, I mentioned training and the playing of shogi. Those can't be the only examples of war like entertainment. <br/>

Drinking, womanizing, and gambling: I don't view these as war like entertainment because all males participate. I'm sure wealth merchants endulged as much if not more then the samurai.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>I'm sure, although the events mentioned previously allegedly took<br/>
place before the battle - hence the lack of drinking and merryment. <br/>
Particularly because Nobunaga was the only one who knew they were<br/>
going to attack until the last minute. Everyone else was preparing for<br/>
a siege with would have eventually fallen.</div>

 </span></blockquote>the Battle of Okehazama, although Wikipedia atributes this to<br/>
fictional sources and reciting a poem instead of actually dancing:<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> > "Various fictional sources depict Nobunaga reciting a stanza from<br/>

his demise in Honnoji:"<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> > <br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Now I finally have a primary source for this to look at:<br/>
<br/>
According to the "Shinchokoki" which I just picked up today ("Record<br/>
of Nobunga" or so) it says that he "sung" the Atsumori before the<br/>
battle. Although from what I've seen a better word would be "intone"<br/>
or "recite", you don't really sing Noh, at least not in the<br/>
traditional sense.  According to the shinchokoki, he sung it after<br/>
hearing about the fall of two forts to the Imagawa (Washizu and<br/>
Marune) as they closed in on him - he apparently made the announcement<br/>
to fight after he finished the atsumori.  The Shinchokoki is<br/>
considered a reliable account, as the author was a first hand witness,<br/>
born in 1527, so I would disagre with Wikipedia in that at least<br/>
Okehazama was probably true.  No one survived Honnouji that I know of<br/>
who could validate things at that point though.</div>
