"dictator" -- whatever that may mean in feudal Japanese terms.<br/>

       My personal humble opinion is that Oda was neither.  Oda was a warlord <br/>
that started the drive to unify Japan, beginning at Okehazama.  I believe he <br/>
did receive the sanction of Emperor Ogimachi (not that it meant anything in <br/>
terms of real power other than the emperor's backing), but no, he was neither a <br/>
dictator or the sole unifier of Japan.  Any thoughts or corrections, ne1?  :-D <br/>
 Take care, y'all.  :-D<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-792140381">I tend to agree, Nobunaga was neither the unifier, or the first 'dictator', he wasn't even shogun.  In terms of the question itself, surely a leader (anywhere) could be both dictator and unifier, they are not mutually exclusive terms.<br/>
Sprouting from the term 'unifier' though I have a question? When was Japan unified? Considering, Hokkaiko was really only geographically part of Japan until the 18th and 19th Centuries, despite incursions and expeditions into the north dating back to the Asuka-jidai, and before; while the Nansei (SW) Islands (Okinawa, etc) were not part of Japan until the first decades of the Edo-jidai. <br/>

at Hononji Temple in Kyoto.Too bad.He could have been a good leader.But his work was continued in a small part by Hideyoshi but Hideyoshi did almost nothing.He tried to conquerKorea but he was forced out because the Koreanswere helped by the Chinese<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1955344940">oda nobunaga caused attrocities to his own people on a par with any <br/>
modern day dictator, the ninja of iga and the monks of ikko in osaka <br/>
where just a few of his victims. There is no doubt he was a great <br/>
tactical mind but he wanted sole control of japan, and as we all no <br/>
the emporer was not where the power laay in japan. Ne way a good book <br/>
to read for modern day workplace is the art of war by sun tzu, its <br/>
chinese but many japanese buisness recomend it to its employees</div>
