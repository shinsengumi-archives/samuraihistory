	or do we call you Nik? A good place to start any investigation into  <br/>
the Japanese sword is here;<br/>

	The Japanese sword index has some great introductory articles and  <br/>
links to just about every worthwhile site on the net that is Nihonto  <br/>
related. Now if you are serious you should join a sword club in your  <br/>
area, you are sure to find at least one hammer-monkey in any group.  <br/>
Also try <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="mailto:nihonto@yahoogroups.com">nihonto@yahoogroups.com</a>, a very open and friendly bunch of  <br/>
collectors and students such as yourself.<br/>
	I might suggest that you may not really want to take on forging a  <br/>
sword if you already describe the process as tedious...<br/>
