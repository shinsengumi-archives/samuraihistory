<h3>Semi-Shaved Heads and Topknots</h3>
by <i>topdogbkk</i>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1096420110">Hi all,<br/>
I've read a fair amount about this topic, however most of the infomation seems to be inconsistent.<br/>
Who really wore topknots and why? I understand the topknot was very important to the samurai class, but why in various prints, paintings and historical depictions of the times peasants are also showen with semi-shaven heads and topknots?<br/>
I've read the reason samurai semi-shaved their heads was for an easier and more comfortable fit when wearing a helmet. Fact or fiction? <br/>
Whilst all samurai seemed to have a topknot unless they were monks not all seemsd to shave the top part of their heads, why?  <br/>
Any ideas?<br/>
Cheers,<br/>
Miles<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1233634789">The 'chonmage' style of topknot worn by sumo wrestlers (or 'oichomage' for the top rikishi) copies the fashions of the 18th century. These find their precedents in Japan among the court styles of the Heian-jidai, with earlier examples unsurprisingly seen in T'ang China. Many sources perpetuate the theory that the style was adopted, by both samurai and ashigaru to facilitate the wearing of a helmet, and give a greater cushion to the skull (a principle still seen sumo, in which the topknot is also to protect the heads during falls). In the Edojidai, the topknot was common throughout society, with the shaved front more than likely a fashion decision for the traditionally flambuoyant samurai.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1865754118">This subject has caught my attention and I've been tooling around the <br/>

royal proclamation (mikotonori) that said that men should "put up <br/>

<br/>
I agree in the main with what you're saying. But hairstyles <br/>
involving shaving (strictly speaking, plucking of hair), either with  <br/>
or without top-knots, were around long before the Edo jidai. As I <br/>
mentioned, it's the accepted wisdom (again again it strikes me as <br/>
urban myth) that part of the head being bald facilitated the wearing <br/>
of the hats of the day - e-boushi and kanmuri. But like you, it <br/>
strikes me as essentially fashion.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>I think you're misreading how they say it developed, because when they wore a <br/>
helmet samurai would let *down* their hair -- the topknot would have interfered <br/>
in wearing the things.<br/>

Court nobles were wearing their hair styled like that from the 8th century or<br/>
earlier, and warriors tended to copy their betters at court.<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Yes, this aligns nicely with my point about _when_ mage came about. <br/>
It was in the line that immediately procedes the text you quote <br/>
above. Again it was:<br/>
<br/>
"While this is quite vague it could very well be the origins of the <br/>
mage hairstyle amoung the ruling classes. Tenmu ruled in the late 7th <br/>
century."<br/>
<br/>
But the exchange was also talking about _why_, or rather why not, the <br/>
mage may have come about.  And I see that in a separate message you <br/>
do agree with my point (made above) that the mage is not a hairstyle <br/>
that came about for some benefit in combat.<br/>
<br/>
It's nice to know I was essentially correct on both points!<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1548572299">The first recorded sumo tournament was held by Empress Kogyoku in 642 for a visiting group of Baekche officials. From that point the sport became an intrinsic part of the martial tournaments, along with equestrianism and archery, with the sumaibito/sumotori drawn from across the country appointed to represent either the Right or Left garrisons of the Imperial Guard. Later Minamoto no Yoritomo was a great fan, holding bouts at the Tsuruoka Hachimangu Shrine, then later Oda Nobunaga who organized a 1,500 strong bout at Azuchi-jou in 1578. During the Edojidai, numerous ronin turned to sumo in the entertainment quarters of Edo or Kyoto, while others served daimyo, receiving a stipend and receiving samurai status. The rikishi are surely continuing their fondness for 'traditional Japan',  but so are those who hold traditional style weddings, wear yukata in the summer, learn ikebana or sado, et alia. Sumo was not a separate institution but part of the fabric of court, and later samurai,<br/>
 life, and therefore it is only natural that the fashions and traditions should pass over. <br/>

book_nihonkamiizenshi.html<br/>
<br/>
Miles et al-<br/>
	Sasama Yoshihiko Sensei's dictionary of everyday life in Japan shows  <br/>
some eighty hairstyles for men, and more than double that for women. If  <br/>
we are talking about the Edo period hairstyles were strictly coded for  <br/>
class, rank and privaledge. Young men usually did not shave their heads  <br/>
until they took the Gempuku, coming of age, even then some might have  <br/>
worn a long forelock. Thus in film we see older "boys" chided for  <br/>
wearing this childish haiirstyle even though they are men or nearly  <br/>
men. Also not uncommon for "gay" characters to wear the same style even  <br/>
though they are older.<br/>
	An adult male attached to a lord would shave his forelock, a ronin or  <br/>
non-conformist, might not. The many different styles mentioned above  <br/>
meant that a persons class and status were instantly recognizable.  <br/>
Samurai top-knots were set straight while farmers and merchants were  <br/>
set to one side or the other, how the end was cut, the material used to  <br/>
tie it and a dozen other things were proscribed by law.<br/>
	Sasama tells us that the hair could either be worn loose or up, in a  <br/>
knot when wearing Oyoroi. At the time Heian gentlemen worn eboshi, a  <br/>
soft hat. Because it was soft it would fold over and these were known  <br/>
as hire-eboshi, a stiff lacquered version was worn with kabuto,  <br/>
wrapping the hair it was pulled thru the tehen at the top of the helmet  <br/>
bowl. Being associated with the Bushi class they became known as  <br/>
"Samurai Eboshi." Heian fashion, not unlike today was a very particular  <br/>
world with strict rules; a few loose hairs was tantamount to farting in  <br/>
someones face, so any loose hairs were plucked.<br/>
	There are several theories as to the rise of Chon-mage. One has it  <br/>
that shaving was more convenient than plucking for when wearing boshi  <br/>
but  the hairstyle remained even when the hat fell out of use. Another  <br/>
says the hat fell out of use because shaving the head became popular.  <br/>
There is the Nobunaga theory; he got fed up with plucking and said "Oh  <br/>
just shave it!", and the Jesuit theory; the style adopted by European  <br/>
monks became a nationwide fad (my favorite).The Mohawk theory; it was  <br/>
considered so manly and fiercesome no warrior could do without it.   <br/>
Some say that taking the time to dress the hair before battle in an age  <br/>
of constant warfare was useless and wasteful, so shaved heads were the  <br/>
norm for warriors ( I think this one is the strongest argument).<br/>
	It all seems to have come about in the Sengoku Jidai, though it  <br/>
started earlier, thats why I like the last theory, no one seems to be  <br/>
saying it was specifically because of or for the wearing of helmets.<br/>
<br/>
-t<br/>
<br/>
PS many Sumo-tori were of Samurai class or recieved promotion to such  <br/>
when very successful by the late Edo it was de rigeur...<br/>

<br/>
  Yes, this aligns nicely with my point about _when_ mage came about. <br/>
  It was in the line that immediately procedes the text you quote <br/>
  above. Again it was:<br/>
<br/>
  "While this is quite vague it could very well be the origins of the <br/>
  mage hairstyle amoung the ruling classes. Tenmu ruled in the late 7th <br/>
  century."<br/>
<br/>
  But the exchange was also talking about _why_, or rather why not, the <br/>
  mage may have come about.  And I see that in a separate message you <br/>
  do agree with my point (made above) that the mage is not a hairstyle <br/>
  that came about for some benefit in combat.<br/>
<br/>
  It's nice to know I was essentially correct on both points!<br/>

Miles et al-<br/>
      Sasama Yoshihiko Sensei's dictionary of everyday life in Japan shows  <br/>
some eighty hairstyles for men, and more than double that for women. If  <br/>
we are talking about the Edo period hairstyles were strictly coded for  <br/>
class, rank and privaledge. Young men usually did not shave their heads  <br/>
until they took the Gempuku, coming of age, even then some might have  <br/>
worn a long forelock. Thus in film we see older "boys" chided for  <br/>
wearing this childish haiirstyle even though they are men or nearly  <br/>
men. Also not uncommon for "gay" characters to wear the same style even  <br/>
though they are older.<br/>
      An adult male attached to a lord would shave his forelock, a ronin or  <br/>
non-conformist, might not. The many different styles mentioned above  <br/>
meant that a persons class and status were instantly recognizable.  <br/>
Samurai top-knots were set straight while farmers and merchants were  <br/>
set to one side or the other, how the end was cut, the material used to  <br/>
tie it and a dozen other things were proscribed by law.<br/>
      Sasama tells us that the hair could either be worn loose or up, in a  <br/>
knot when wearing Oyoroi. At the time Heian gentlemen worn eboshi, a  <br/>
soft hat. Because it was soft it would fold over and these were known  <br/>
as hire-eboshi, a stiff lacquered version was worn with kabuto,  <br/>
wrapping the hair it was pulled thru the tehen at the top of the helmet  <br/>
bowl. Being associated with the Bushi class they became known as  <br/>
"Samurai Eboshi." Heian fashion, not unlike today was a very particular  <br/>
world with strict rules; a few loose hairs was tantamount to farting in  <br/>
someones face, so any loose hairs were plucked.<br/>
      There are several theories as to the rise of Chon-mage. One has it  <br/>
that shaving was more convenient than plucking for when wearing boshi  <br/>
but  the hairstyle remained even when the hat fell out of use. Another  <br/>
says the hat fell out of use because shaving the head became popular.  <br/>
There is the Nobunaga theory; he got fed up with plucking and said "Oh  <br/>
just shave it!", and the Jesuit theory; the style adopted by European  <br/>
monks became a nationwide fad (my favorite).The Mohawk theory; it was  <br/>
considered so manly and fiercesome no warrior could do without it.   <br/>
Some say that taking the time to dress the hair before battle in an age  <br/>
of constant warfare was useless and wasteful, so shaved heads were the  <br/>
norm for warriors ( I think this one is the strongest argument).<br/>
      It all seems to have come about in the Sengoku Jidai, though it  <br/>
started earlier, thats why I like the last theory, no one seems to be  <br/>
saying it was specifically because of or for the wearing of helmets.<br/>
<br/>
-t<br/>
<br/>
PS many Sumo-tori were of Samurai class or recieved promotion to such  <br/>
when very successful by the late Edo it was de rigeur...<br/>

	during the Edo period the topknot was integral to your cast and <br/>
position. As head of a household or as son of an important house it <br/>
would be scandalous if your hair were cut "by accident". Cutting of the <br/>
hair was symbolic of giving up secular life or life itself. I don't <br/>
believe death was mandatory though, as depicted in comics and the movie <br/>
Seppuku, I am sure a great deal would depend on circumstance...<br/>
