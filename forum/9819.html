<br/>
I think the reason that they 'vanished' is clear:  The Meiji<br/>
government officially revoked the warrior class.  As to *why* they did<br/>
it:  The warrior class was seen by many as an old (thousand year)<br/>
institution that was preventing Japan from modernizing.  Rightly or<br/>

<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1467106521">! ruin !  is mis-spelling.   Reign, or  Rule  is collect.  Sorry about this.<br/>
   <br/>
  You pointed out very reasoble things and comprehensive .  I  agree to that without no argument.<br/>
  However,  before Meiji new Government which you pointed out came out  in Japan which ,  something had already been happened in Edo era society.  Let me explain as follows;<br/>
   <br/>
  Considering Buke days for about 1,200 years,  the final stage for them was end of Edo era.  <br/>
   <br/>
   At the first stage when Yeyas Tokugawa, shogun,  opened Government ( Bakufu ) through  200 years after that , which was 1860 AC  , feudalism had been followed  and Buke had been safety.  After 200 years warriors days ,  all Japanese enjoyed peasful life for long times.<br/>
   <br/>
   However,  from the interim of Edo era onward already,  the seed of problem to maintain Buke rank had been born,  which was  the reason , the cause of the change from  feudalism  to money oriented society,  or commodity oriented society and which triggered the situation Buke rank was unable to<br/>
 live without having put more heavier land tax to peasants .   Furthermore, the export of textiles, or foods , etc from Japan to overseas had been increasing, which brought more demand for those things and the prices had hiked so much , triggering more poverty to Buke.    And the peasants formed<br/>
 their own army and raised riots in everywhere.   Edo government tried to settle those riots, but they could not solved completely.    On the contrary,  the merchants had become  richier and richier  , getting more power.  <br/>
   <br/>
  Buke had been finally facing to the poverty  and formed  hostility groups against Edo  Gernment because Edo Gernment could not help Buke.<br/>
   <br/>
  At that time,  some new thinkers came out who stressed liberalism and said Japan shoud be reigned by the capable man not only by Buke, no matter what ranks were, which tried to change from feudalism to new world implying  new government under new power..  Under these circumstrances, new power<br/>
 organised by  Chosu  and  Satsuma,  lower Buke rank ,  formed new government called Meiji .<br/>
   <br/>
  Due to the influence by the change of economic matters such as feudalism economic to capitalism finally,  Buke was forced to give up their rank  and many buke families were forced to sell their lands or assets to rich merchants or, new Meiji Government  and  finally had becom  peasants,  or, <br/>
 business man  by  investing money to company newly established under  Meiji  Government.<br/>
   <br/>
  So ,  please remember the seed of problem to bring the change to new world was born already inside the current , old structure,  long time before  next new structure.   Like cancer, the seed of cancer is born before come out to surface, visibility .    Economic matters  are the key factors to<br/>
 change the structure.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1524455054">Things tend not to vanish, rather evolve, or they are assimulated into something else.

     Your saying,  evolve , or assimulated into something else, is right word , I agree.<br/>
     (  Even I used to live in US  for 15years and have been involving the business with US  over  30 years , using English,  I can't use right English.  Sorry about that.<br/>
       However, thanks to you and other American friends in this community, I'm glad to learn and find more unknown word of English and increase the vocaburary.)<br/>
   <br/>
      In fact,  lastly, Buke,  Samurai were forced to become Governer, Policeman, Farmer, Businessmen, Teacher, etc , due to  the fact that New Meiji government formed and issued new constitution , resulted in non existence of occupation of Buke.  <br/>
   <br/>
     Before Meiji revolution ,  Buke  was the top rank of class next to Emperor, then Farmers, Merchants, etc.   However, after Meiji revolution, Buke class evolved to others like above mentioned.<br/>

     Now,  my next question is then  , does Emperor exist from now on ?<br/>
      After Buke took over the power of reign firstly about 1,200 years ago, Emperor continued to alive , exist without doing  things but just doing the things related to religion  in somewhere in Kyoto.   And,  after WW II,  Emperor keep doing just smiling , eating with visiters from overseas<br/>
 sometimes  without the right to vote, because he was  appointed as the symbol <br/>
   <br/>
       In fact,  Japanese needed something like symbol , mercy , for the time being after collapse by WW II , however,   Japan recovered completely and now , most of Japanese don't need mercy, symbol any more.    So, one day, there will be no reason to exist .    Maybe, one day,  they are foreced<br/>

Info assimulated! As to your supposition on the role of the emperor, perhaps the views pre-Tokogawa and a glimps into Roman history may provide illumination for you. Consider the opinion of the first Westerners in Japan: Zavier and his associates, traders etc. What was their perception of the emperor? They called him the "pope of Japan". The title suggested a man of respect, of holyiness and position, but someone who lacked real power, more influence perhaps. And a quick consideration of the later Roman Emperors: they too often were figure heads, and lacked quantifiable power. Looking in these area may help refine your questions and answers. Drop me an email if you want to bounce ideas off me. P.s, I'm an Englishman, not an American.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-751884309">Hi Tom,<br/>
   <br/>
    Here is the real thing which I like to point out regarding why BUKE were foreced to be changed to other ranks at the end of EDO era.<br/>
   <br/>
   <br/>
  They say one very tiny bud  of problem had been born and been buried in the society already, and grew bigger and bigger , before something happened and the society was changed entirely.  In this case, the change of BUKE had been attributed mainly to the change of economy .    <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
  In the interim of Edo Bakufu days, the economy had been changed gradually to Money oriented economy , Commodity oriented economy from longcontinued Feudal economy .   And so , Buke were forced to be poorer and poorer as a result of the fact that BUKE got only registered income from BAKUFU , but<br/>
 Merchants had began to be richer and richer.<br/>
  In order to get more income , BUKE got impose heavier tax on Farmers, facing to the poverty of BUKE.   so sever, resulting in Farmers riots against such heavier tax imposed by BUKE.<br/>
  On the top of that , BUKE borrowed more loan from Merchants and BUKE soon  became in a position not be able to return loan to them.   And at the end of Edo Bakufu days, Bakufu lost power to get back the social order to be ruined to be transformed to new Meiji Government.<br/>
   <br/>
  Facing to the change, Meiji Government issued public bonds and gave to BUKE to sell and become capitalist newly , or BUKE newly were assigned to be Governors under the new constitutes.<br/>
   <br/>
  As I pointed out earlier,  the main reason why BUKE were forced to be changed to other ranks was the change of economy. <br/>
   <br/>
    By the way,  what part of England are living ?  I visited  London several times on business  quite a long time ago.<br/>

Info assimulated! As to your supposition on the role of the emperor, perhaps the views pre-Tokogawa and a glimps into Roman history may provide illumination for you. Consider the opinion of the first Westerners in Japan: Zavier and his associates, traders etc. What was their perception of the<br/>
 emperor? They called him the "pope of Japan". The title suggested a man of respect, of holyiness and position, but someone who lacked real power, more influence perhaps. And a quick consideration of the later Roman Emperors: they too often were figure heads, and lacked quantifiable power. Looking<br/>
 in these area may help refine your questions and answers. Drop me an email if you want to bounce ideas off me. P.s, I'm an Englishman, not an American.<br/>

Hi Tom, and All,Your saying, evolve , or assimulated into something else, is right word , I agree.( Even I used to live in US for 15years and have been involving the business with US over 30 years , using English, I can't use right English. Sorry about that.However, thanks to you and other<br/>
 American friends in this community, I'm glad to learn and find more unknown word of English and increase the vocaburary.)In fact, lastly, Buke, Samurai were forced to become Governer, Policeman, Farmer, Businessmen, Teacher, etc , due to the fact that New Meiji government formed and issued new<br/>
 constitution , resulted in non existence of occupation of Buke. Before Meiji revolution , Buke was the top rank of class next to Emperor, then Farmers, Merchants, etc. However, after Meiji revolution, Buke class evolved to others like above mentioned.Now, my next question is then , does Emperor<br/>
 exist from now on ?After Buke took over the power of reign firstly about 1,200 years ago, Emperor continued to alive , exist without doing things but just doing the things related to religion in somewhere in Kyoto. And, after WW II, Emperor keep doing just smiling , eating with visiters from<br/>
 overseassometimes without the right to vote, because he was appointed as the symbol In fact, Japanese needed something like symbol , mercy , for the time being after collapse by WW II , however, Japan recovered completely and now , most of Japanese don't need mercy, symbol any more. So, one day,<br/>
 there will be no reason to exist . Maybe, one day, they are forecedto become just civilian and take some job to alive.How do you think ?EddieTom Dowling <vaevictis@...> wrote:Things tend not to vanish, rather evolve, or they are assimulated into something else. Roman Legions did not<br/>
 vanish: the quality of the army was diluted until the Western Empire fell to the barbarian tribes; the Vikings enjoyed much power until the black death arrived in Norway in 13th century,only for the few to survive to be conquered by Danes and Swedes.
