<h3>Nobunaga as a villain</h3>
by <i>crusadergraphics</i>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1284423050">I've noticed this in the past but never paid much mind to it until I <br/>
was given a game called Samurai Warriors. In it, Oda is shown in <br/>
black/purplish armor, a red dracula-like cloak and a glowing purple <br/>
western style sword. This brought back some distant memories. I <br/>
remember seeing Nobunaga as a villain in a game from the mid 90s <br/>
called Sengoku..similar outfit.<br/>
<br/>
My question is this: why is ALWAYS portrayed as some sort of unholy <br/>
monster in anime (stupid american otaku nerds) and video games?<br/>

I mean, you need a villain in a game, right?<br/>

       I think I know why, Gabriel.  In an interview with PrimaGames for the <br/>

Keiji said that one reason he (Nobunaga) was portrayed as a villain was because, <br/>
in Japan (and I'm only paraphrasing his answer, not adding my own pitiful <br/>

even for the time he lived.  They made him the villain to show people this <br/>

 </span></blockquote>This is the same case for me as well...I always had an interest in <br/>
the japanese, samurai especially. But this interest was bolstered 100 <br/>
fold when I actually found my japanese family name in a video <br/>
game....being 'Nobanaga's Ambition'. A war general in one of the  <br/>
western provinces had our family name..."masazumi". After seeing <br/>
this, my curiosity began to peak. However, having a young family, <br/>
full time job, and moving around the city....I can't find as much <br/>
time as I would like to satisfy my interest in the culture...past and <br/>
present.<br/>
<br/>
Just thought I'd share this common point....have a great day everyone<br/>

 </span></blockquote>This is a good illustration of the mindset that is behind the <br/>
"Nobunaga as villain" philosophy in the west. It's based on <br/>
modern/western sensibilities to reach the conclusion that "Nobunaga <br/>
was a villain". This philosophy really is not that popular <br/>
in Japan.<br/>
<br/>
As several people have noted, including the original poster, <br/>
"Nobunaga as villain" is something you might see in computer or <br/>
video cames coming out of Japan. It also exists in some other <br/>
"pop" kinds of entertainment. <br/>
<br/>
But in most Japanese sources, Nobunaga is not seen as a villain. His <br/>
more over-the-top things that in our day and age are quite shocking, <br/>
were even shocking when they happened. But the overall impression <br/>
is not Nobunaga as villain, but for the most part, Nobunaga as <br/>
heroic figure.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>I think Nobunaga was interested in Christianity mainly for two reasons:<br/>
1 - Guns. The Portuguese missionaries (and the merchants that arrived <br/>
with them) brought some, and promised more. I have even read somewhere <br/>
(but not sure, perhaps the experts of this list can confirm) that <br/>
Nobunaga wore a Portuguese armor, at times.<br/>
2 - Nobunaga hated organized Buddhism, not the religion or the <br/>
philosophy, but the "Buddhist posse" (the ikki). Christianity was thus <br/>
a convenient 'alternative.'<br/>
I really doubt Nobunaga was interested in the Christian ideals, <br/>
nonetheless he seemed to have an interest for things from the West, <br/>
especially if they could give him a political-ideological or martial <br/>
advantage.<br/>

When you said <br/>
"But in most Japanese sources, Nobunaga is not seen as a villain." <br/>
You must had meant Japanese CHRISTIAN sources!!! <br/>
<br/>
Oda Nobunaga still be an negative reference in Japan history even to <br/>
nowaddays. <br/>
It is not in videogames or in manga, and anime... <br/>
Some parents still tell nobunaga tales to scare ill behaved children at <br/>
Japan, and he is an very used character in some occult movies such as <br/>
Kujaku-Ou! <br/>
<br/>
And HEROIC is the tales about those brave ninjas who exterminated the <br/>
bastard! <br/>
<br/>
Nobunaga had the vicious addiction to do genocide against buddhist temples <br/>
and against vilages near those temples, and killed and maimed many just <br/>
because they dwelt near those temples, until he decided to mess with the <br/>
vilages inside the Iiga mountain... *a very big grim*... <br/>
<br/>
The rest of the history, I let to the people who know what I am speak about, <br/>
to imagine. :-) <br/>
<br/>
In fact, Oda Nobunaga was not too much different than the bastard of Adolf <br/>
Hitler himself. <br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>No. And your use of "still" comes from your assumption that, at <br/>
some point, Nobunaga was seen as a villain. This is not the case, <br/>
either in the past or now. <br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> >It is not in videogames or in manga, and anime... <br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Yes, it is. Obviously. That's where the whole conversation got <br/>
started. Plus it is seen in at least one "cult movie" as you have <br/>
taught me (see below).<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> >Some parents still tell nobunaga tales to scare ill behaved children at <br/>

>Kujaku-Ou! <br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>No. Of course I can't deny that some parents somewhere <br/>
might "tell nobunaga stories". But if they do I've never heard <br/>
of it. It is certainly not a common practice.<br/>
<br/>
I've never heard of Kujaku-Ou. Anyway if the "Nobuanga as villain" <br/>
theme is used in this movies and others like it, it exactly fits my <br/>
point -- these are examples of this theme being used in very light <br/>
entertainment or pop culture.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> >And HEROIC is the tales about those brave ninjas who exterminated the <br/>

 </span></blockquote>This is a different use of the word heroic that is outside of the <br/>
scope of the current conversation.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> >Nobunaga had the vicious addiction to do genocide against buddhist temples <br/>

<br/>
As said in a prevoius mail, sure, if we judge Nobunaga by modern <br/>
standards, he was a villain, indeed.<br/>
<br/>
However, even if today Japan has digested a bit of the Western concept <br/>
of "good" and "bad," I can assure you that Nobunaga is NOT universally <br/>
seen as a murderer. Quite the opposite, I'd argue. He is the "cool bad <br/>
guy," eventually, somebody like Darth Vader... and to some, a hero, <br/>
embodying some of the highest values of the Japanese tradition.<br/>
<br/>
I would say there are few reasons for that:<br/>
<br/>
1 - He was a "strong man," and the Japanese revere people with strong <br/>
will.<br/>
<br/>
2 - Asia has a tradition of men who cared about "duty," rather than <br/>
about individuals. Just think of the indian Prince Krishna in the <br/>
Bhagavad-Gita, of the Chinese first Emperor, Qin Shi Huang Di (who's <br/>
celebrated even in recent times, by Mao Tze Tung, rather than in Jet <br/>
Li's "Hero"), and of course of Nobunaga and Hideyoshi. Nobunaga had a <br/>
goal: to unify Japan. He dedicated his life to that, and he wouldn't <br/>
stop at nothing. Some people like such attitude.<br/>
Again, careful with comparisons with people such as Hitler. Hitler <br/>
invaded foreign countries, and he created a bureaucratic apparatus to <br/>
kill civilians (=concentration camps). Nobunaga played in his own <br/>
country and he killed simply what was on his way.<br/>
<br/>
3 - Finally, it can be argued that Nobunaga, just as many other <br/>
unifiers, worked for a 'greater good.' The unification was necessarily <br/>
a bloodshed, but what emerged at its end (the Tokugawa Shogunate) <br/>
formed the basis for modern Japan and guaranteed 250+ years of relative <br/>
peace. Ultimately, if Japan would have go on "sengokuing" another <br/>
100-200 years, it would have been routed easily by the first Western <br/>
fleet arriving. So, the unification was a good thing for Japan, I would <br/>
say.<br/>
<br/>
In general, our approach as historians (??) should be less judgmental. <br/>
We are here to observe, perhaps comment, but we are in no position to <br/>
judge the "morality" or the "sense of justice" of a man who lived some <br/>
500 years ago in a far away country, engulfed in a civil war.<br/>
<br/>
Sure, by our modern Enlightenment-Christian influenced standard, he was <br/>
a villain. But this is a biased point of view. I think.<br/>
<br/>
cepo<br/>
<br/>
PS = I believe Nobunaga was not killed by ninja, but by Akechi <br/>
Mitsuhide's men. Apparently, Nobunaga was on his way to Kyoto to do <br/>
some tea ceremony. He stayed over at a temple, and there he's got it. <br/>
There is no historical evidence of his death, however. The temple <br/>
(Honnouji) burnt down, and he probably perished in the fire, perhaps <br/>
after committing seppuku. It was 1582. Hideyoshi, was campaigning in <br/>
the West, and once he heard the news he returned to Kyoto, and he <br/>
destroyed Akechi Mitsuhide, to become the new leader of Japan.</div>

 </span></blockquote>This is a bit too convenient. On the one hand it's too generalistic. <br/>
On the other hand there were plentoy of strong men to be had during <br/>
this period. Not many have become as talked about and as studied as <br/>
Nobunaga. So I guess at the least I could agree that this is part of <br/>
the reason - but it doesn't go very far in explaining Nobunaga's <br/>
legacy.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> >2 - Asia has a tradition of men who cared about "duty," rather than <br/>
>about individuals. Just think of the indian Prince Krishna in the <br/>
 </span></blockquote>First this again is too generalistic. We are not talking about <br/>
"Asia" we are specifically talking about Japan.<br/>
<br/>
Second it can be argued that Nobunaga had no sense of duty whatsoever. <br/>
He killed several of his older relatives on his way to uniting his <br/>
own kuni (Owari). He got rid of several long-time family vassals and <br/>
is famous for his ability to pick and chose followers of ability. <br/>
This implies that he did not use tradition or loyalty or duty to <br/>
maintain his retainers.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> >Li's "Hero"), and of course of Nobunaga and Hideyoshi. Nobunaga had a <br/>

 </span></blockquote>I don't understand your reference here. How do Nobunaga and Hideyoshi <br/>
relate to "duty" here?<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> >goal: to unify Japan. He dedicated his life to that, and he wouldn't <br/>
>stop at nothing. Some people like such attitude.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>This is not the sense of "duty" that is meant in Japan. Duty (in the <br/>
honorable, admirable sense) is not to a cause, but to a person of <br/>
autority, or one could say to a structure. Duty to one's own goal of <br/>
unifying Japan is not in and of itself an admirable trait that would <br/>
go down well in the annals of history.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> >Again, careful with comparisons with people such as Hitler. Hitler <br/>
>invaded foreign countries, and he created a bureaucratic apparatus to <br/>
>kill civilians (=concentration camps). Nobunaga played in his own <br/>
>country and he killed simply what was on his way.<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I agree about the unfortunate temptation to compare with Hitler. <br/>
It's quite banal. But I would also caution that Nobunaga did kill more <br/>
than "those who were in his way". He was ruthless and certainly <br/>
over the top on more than one occasion.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> >3 - Finally, it can be argued that Nobunaga, just as many other <br/>
>unifiers, worked for a 'greater good.' The unification was necessarily <br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I see this as being dangerously close to falling into the very trap <br/>
that you are cautioning against. Nobunaga's efforts were neither for <br/>
good nor for evil. He did what he did out of sheer personal ambition <br/>
and his sense of his place in the order of things. <br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> >a bloodshed, but what emerged at its end (the Tokugawa Shogunate) <br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I agree with this. Nobunaga's place in Japanese history comes, at <br/>
least in part, because he is seen as having kicked off the process <br/>
of ending the old order and bringing together the new order. His <br/>
role in the thing - whatever his motive - has been to put the nail in <br/>
the coffin of the old way, and to set the wheels in motion for <br/>
Tokugawa to finally pacify the country. He is seen as the terrible <br/>
destroyer and the mighty creator - a powerful, aweful, awesome man who <br/>
it is almost impossible to believe actually existed. It seems like <br/>
a fictional story. His impact on the direction of Japan is impossible <br/>
to measure. That is, at least to some degree, the simple reason why he <br/>
lives on in the imagination and in the popular culture.<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Yes yes yes. 1000 time yes. And this approach is much more <br/>
common among Japanese historians.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> >Sure, by our modern Enlightenment-Christian influenced standard, he was <br/>

Nobunaga is said to have fought without armor for some time, then <br/>
when it was clear that the day was lost, he retreated into the <br/>
temple to commit seppuku. <br/>

mattered. Anyone who betrayed him, plotted against him, or threatened his<br/>
position was no longer to be trusted, and needed to be dealt with.<br/>
<br/>

oneself as the only one who can do it. It's the whole "duty to a higher cause"<br/>
thing. Ambition can figure into it, but there's a duty to one's vision.<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>True. But it discouraged a lot more outbreaks. It's a rather bloody version of<br/>
the "breaking eggs to make omelettes" thing, with a little bit of "pour<br/>
encourager les autres" as well. You wipe out a village or two now and five other<br/>
villages down the line will think twice about rising.<br/>
<br/>
It's telling that the thing that did Nobunaga in was betrayal and treason rather<br/>
than an outside enemy. I don't think anyone but an insider COULD have gotten him.<br/>

<br/>
Mitsuhide *ran* the attack, he ordered it. He didn't contract for someone from<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I think the broader context of the conversation would probably be <br/>
helpful.<br/>
<br/>
The person who I was replying to said:<br/>
"Asia has a tradition of men who cared about "duty," rather than <br/>
about individuals."<br/>
<br/>
I was replying to that comment. Which is why I said that Nobunaga <br/>
did not have a sense of duty. Which (in my opinion) he did not. That <br/>
is not a moralistic judgement on my part.<br/>
<br/>
He was respectful to the court but he would not suffer to be bound by <br/>
duty. He showed minimal respect to his superiors in terms of rank <br/>
or life-station (ie his elders). This of course includes the Shogun.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> >> He killed several of his older relatives on his way to uniting his <br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Unfortunately I think you've missed my point. Maybe I didn't do a <br/>
very good job of explaining it. I hope that I did not say that <br/>
"Nobunaga did not demand loyalty or duty". What I meant to say is that <br/>
he did not practice it himself, either to his betters or to his own <br/>
vassals.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> >Rather pragmatic, really.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Agreed. However it is often pointed out that Nobunaga was this <br/>
way to a much higher degree than most of his contemporaries. So <br/>
while it may be pragmatic it wasn't that common.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> >> This is not the sense of "duty" that is meant in Japan. Duty (in the <br/>

>thing. Ambition can figure into it, but there's a duty to one's vision.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>This is incorrect in the context of the discussion. It implies that <br/>
duty can somehow be judged based on one's own personal opinions of <br/>
what ought to be done. This is not how duty works, at least not in the <br/>
Japanese aethetic. You don't get to pick your duty. That is the very <br/>
essense of the thing.<br/>
<br/>
To be clear I understand what you're saying and I agree that this <br/>
sense of purpose was what propelled Nobunaga (and I said as much in a <br/>
part of my message that you've chosen not to quote) . But again, <br/>
recall the context of this discussion. The messase I was replying to <br/>
somehow said that Nobunaga's sense of duty is what makes him such a <br/>
popular figure in Japan. <br/>
<br/>
And I simply disagree with that assessment. This sense of "duty to <br/>
one's own vision" is not -- in Japan -- the kind of trait that would <br/>
be admired and would explain why Nobunaga has become such a grand <br/>
figure in Japan. Duty in the sense of 義理 or 義務 would have <br/>
explained it, but not "duty" to one's vision. This "being true to <br/>
one's own self" is called wagamama &#21566;&#12364;&#12414;&#12414; in Japan and it is almost <br/>
the oposite of admirable.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> >> I agree about the unfortunate temptation to compare with Hitler. <br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>100% agree. My overall point is that people tend to exaggerate <br/>
their &#20449;&#38263;&#20687; one way or the other. Either they have this "Nobunaga as <br/>
blood-sucking vampire" image or the have this "everything he did was <br/>
perfectly normal for his day and age" image. Both are incorrect. He <br/>
was not a blood-sucking vampire, but then again some of his actions <br/>
were seen as atrocious even at the time.<br/>

<br/>

ctly what happened there" I feel it's always best to hedge my <br/>
expressions when talking about this incident<br/>

<h3>Re: Nobunaga as a villain</h3>

<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1308077202">Come on!!! What of different was in his deeds that was so different of other <br/>
kings who supported kristendoom? <br/>
<br/>
In Norway, Olaf Tryggvarsson killed more than 4000 people in his own country <br/>
just for the "crime" to refuse to accept the new unique god and betray their <br/>
ancestors gods and goddesses... The Helgar Kindir, Asar ok Vanir! <br/>
<br/>
With Nobunaga was all the same... <br/>
<br/>
"Don�t spread I am telling lies. <br/>
Just get up and PROVE I am wrong! <br/>
The history of the Church <br/>
is full of lies and conspiration for power!" <br/>
Goetche <br/>
<br/>
The Kristendoom prommoted the idea of the divine right to rule, as well, <br/>
military support to those leaders who would support such religion <br/>
infiltration. <br/>
<br/>
For those without honour like him, and with a lack of respect for his <br/>
ancestors and ancestral gods and goddesses, it would be easy to him, like <br/>
many christian kings did, to sell his soul for the undead god in echange to <br/>
more Power, disregarding the price that is the blood and soul of his own <br/>
people... <br/>
<br/>
And yes! He hated buddhism! If would be just the organization, he would not <br/>
kill and torture poor and weaponless villagers for the crime of just <br/>
dwelling near those temples... <br/>

It is sad.... very sad... <br/>
