Japanese encounters with the West <br/>
By MANABU HARA, Senior Staff Writer <br/>

<br/>
 <br/>
What is kawaraban? Literally a roof-tile print, it was, says the <br/>
Kodansha Encyclopedia of Japan, ``a commercial news sheet of the Edo <br/>
Period (1603-1867). It is thought that the name kawaraban derives <br/>
from the fact that engraved roofing tiles were once used as printing <br/>
plates; early on, however, the tiles were replaced by woodblocks.'' <br/>
<br/>
In other words, kawaraban was a prototype of today's newspaper that <br/>
flourished in Edo (Tokyo). No wonder then that many kawaraban <br/>
depicted with surprise and fear Commodore Matthew Perry's kurofune <br/>
(black ships), which appeared off Uraga, near Yokohama, in 1853. <br/>
<br/>
Records of Japanese being startled by modern Western civilization <br/>
are now on display at the Japan Newspaper Museum in Yokohama. The <br/>
exhibition, which lasts until Sept. 26, includes ukiyo-e pictures of <br/>
the modern Western ships that approached Japan at the end of the Edo <br/>
Period and American and British picture papers reporting on <br/>
expeditions to Japan. The articles are owned by private collectors <br/>
belonging to a group called the Yokohama Kurofune Kenkyukai <br/>
(Yokohama black-ship study group). <br/>
<br/>
Perry entered Edo Bay (now Tokyo Bay) to break open the door that <br/>
Japan had long closed to the outside world. Strongly pressured by <br/>
the U.S. naval commander, the Tokugawa government reluctantly <br/>
concluded in 1854 what it called the ``Kanagawa treaty,'' opening <br/>
the door for the United States. The exhibition commemorates the <br/>
150th anniversary of the Kanagawa treaty. <br/>
<br/>
Kawaraban was one of the few means for average Japanese to learn <br/>
what was going on in their society. The illustrations in the news <br/>
sheets, depicted by anonymous but imaginative artists, show how <br/>
average Japanese perceived Western civilization. <br/>
<br/>
The exhibition is divided into six parts reflecting different <br/>
historical stages, including the first appearance of the U.S. fleet, <br/>
the subsequent opening of the port of Yokohama and the development <br/>
of the city under the influence of Western culture. The exhibition <br/>
is basically intended to convey how kawaraban and ukiyo-e recounted <br/>
the arrival of Western civilization. <br/>
<br/>
Many kawaraban illustrations depict Westerners as tengu (a long-<br/>
nosed goblin), a fantasy creature that Japanese thought had <br/>
supernatural power. The pictures of tengu show that what most struck <br/>
Japanese were Westerners' big noses. They give the impression that <br/>
Japanese found Westerners frightening or mysterious. One Western <br/>
naval officer is shown with a traditional Chinese sword, which seems <br/>
to indicate that information about foreigners was jumbled. <br/>
<br/>
A kawaraban that evokes laughs shows a group of kneeling Westerners, <br/>
including Perry, bowing before a large Japanese, who is depicted as <br/>
the hero of a renowned drama called ``Kokusen ya Kassen'' (The <br/>
Battles of Coxing). The picture seems to be saying that when <br/>
confronting unwelcome matters, people are apt to believe things of <br/>
advantage to themselves, a tendency that continues to this day. <br/>
<br/>
Two English-language newspapers on exhibit are Gleason's Pictorial, <br/>
published in the United States, and the Illustrated London News. The <br/>
American newspaper predicts a coming war between a daimyo and a <br/>
combined Western fleet, saying: ``recent intelligence from Japan <br/>
looks like an approaching renewal of hostilities with one of the <br/>
Daimyos or half-independent Princes of that country who are <br/>
nominally vassals of the Tycoon.'' <br/>
<br/>
Japanese today do not depict Westerners as tengu. But could it be <br/>
they have the same kind of feeling toward the West that their <br/>
ancestors did? After seeing these prized artifacts from the end of <br/>
the Edo Period, viewers may leave the exhibition pondering that <br/>
thought.(IHT/Asahi: September 11,2004) (09/11)</div>
