<h3>nagamaki/naginata</h3>

<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-132461048">I have been following the group for some time, and would like to thank everybody for the very insightful information on the women warriors topic, the Hara-kari/Seppuku and such. Thanks!<br/>
I'm in the midst of researching, and would like to get my facts right:<br/>
From what I understand, the nagamaki blade may be as long and as shaped as a katana's. the instances I have found in books and on the web describe the nagamaki pole shorter than the naginata's, and sometimes equals the length of the nagamaki blade on the other end. <br/>
Is this true, or was there an instance of a katana blade on a naginata pole?<br/>
<br/>
Thanks!<br/>
<br/>

	While they are both "swords on a stick", the naginata in general <br/>
doesn't have a yokote line delineating the point. Nagamaki "poles" <br/>
would have been as long or a little longer than the blade. The age and <br/>
shape of the blade are big factors in assigning something the Nagamaki <br/>
designation in the absence of a yokote and a koshirae, in which 99% of <br/>
such blades would be classed as naginata. Not sure this helps...<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-998042656">Thanks, Tom. I understand that the definition of the nagakami changed according to the blade throughout the eras. I do know that the naginata blades are usually much wider, though shorter, hence lighter and more suited for women. Alas, my research continues!<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-2056303165">In case this helps. I have a Bakamatsu period nagamaki by Yamon Naokatsu. It<br/>
is more like a wide sword than a naginata and has a shinogi but no yokote<br/>
(as Tom says). The blade, which is almost straight has a choji-midare hamon<br/>
in the Bizen style and is 74cm in length, the nakago is another 51 cm and it<br/>
was a ploishing nightmare I am told.<br/>
The pole itself is 1mtr 29 cm. There is a Namabam style "cupped" tsuba and<br/>
the top part of the pole is wrapped like the tsuka of a sword over same (ray<br/>
skin) and there is a aogai lacquered section below this. It is a fearsome<br/>
weapon which I would think was not easy to use, in fact this is probably a<br/>
parade rather than a battle weapon, considering its late date.<br/>
I think some katana blades were mountd in poles but this is probably Western<br/>
dealer adaptations.<br/>
