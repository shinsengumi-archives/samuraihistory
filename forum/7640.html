TRACE the path of the samurai on an upscale cultural tour of Japan <br/>
that follows the historic Tokaido, the main road of feudal Japan. <br/>
<br/>
The 11-day Esprit Tours & Travel tour, which begins Nov. 4 in Tokyo, <br/>
travels by train to Hakone, Ise and Kyoto. In feudal times, the <br/>
Tokaido (the Eastern Sea Road) was the highway traveled between the <br/>
old imperial capital, Kyoto, where the emperor lived, and Tokyo, <br/>
where the shogun lived. <br/>
<br/>
"Our tours do things that people couldn't do on their own. They just <br/>
wouldn't have the opportunity," said tour representative Nancy <br/>
Craft. "For example, in Kyoto we visit the home of an international <br/>
calligraphy master who is a performance artist." <br/>
<br/>
While in Tokyo, participants will tour Sensoji Temple (also known as <br/>
Asakusa Kannon Temple) and the Meiji Shrine; they'll visit the Edo-<br/>
Tokyo Museum and shopping districts, including the trendy Omotesando-<br/>
dori area.<br/>
<br/>
They'll also visit the Tsukiji wholesale fish market and Takashimaya <br/>
gourmet market.<br/>
<br/>
The next stop is Hakone, a resort area known for its mineral baths <br/>
and home to several museums and an outdoor sculpture garden.<br/>
<br/>
They'll take a cable-car ride to view Mt. Fuji and Owakudani Crater, <br/>
returning by boat on Lake Ashi.<br/>
<br/>
They will travel along the coast to Ise, visit Ise-Shima National <br/>
Park and tour Toba's Mikimoto Pearl Island. <br/>
<br/>
In Kyoto, tour participants will stop at Ginkaku-ji (the Silver <br/>
Pavilion), Jodo Temple and several Zen monasteries. <br/>
<br/>
They will attend a private traditional tea ceremony at the Moss <br/>
Temple (Kokedera), where they will try the art of calligraphy and <br/>
tour the moss gardens. <br/>
<br/>
Cost: $5,150 per person, double occupancy ($1,050 single surcharge), <br/>
including accommodations, most meals, train transportation, <br/>
bilingual guides, admissions and excursions. International airfare <br/>
is not included.<br/>
