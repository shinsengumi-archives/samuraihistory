<h3>Obata Kagenori &....</h3>
by <i>jeff_l_harris</i>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-979891979">Konnichi wa,<br/>
   I'm trying to put together a project that includes a discussion of<br/>
Obata(s) Kagenori, Toramori, Masamori, Nobusada, & Nobushige, but I'm <br/>
having a difficult time finding information and untangling some <br/>
features of how (or if) they are related. In sum, I have the <br/>
following questions:<br/>
<br/>
1). Are they all from the same (general) lineage? Any details <br/>
available?<br/>
2). More specifically, how are Toramori, Masamori, and Kagenori <br/>
related? I have found conflicting info. on this.<br/>
3). Does anyone happen to know anything about them and their <br/>
activities beyond dates of birth/death and other surface info.? Or, <br/>
are there any decent sources in English (beyond Samurai Archives--<br/>
I've farmed as much as I can from there!) where I might find <br/>
something a bit more in-depth?<br/>
<br/>
Thanks much in advance for any assistance and/or clues! <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1315678060">This is some of what I have, let me know if you want me to clarify <br/>
anything, or if you have other questions:<br/>
<br/>
According to the 'Sengoku Jinmei Jiten', Obata Masamori was the son <br/>
of Obata Toramori.  Obata Nobusada was the son of Obata Shigesada. <br/>
Obata Kagenori was the son of Obata Masamori.<br/>
<br/>
OBATA Toramori 1505?-1561<br/>
Toramori first served Takeda Nobutora, from whom he was granted the <br/>
use of 'tora' in his name. He fought in many battles for Takeda <br/>
Shingen under the leadership of Baba Nobufusa and was said to have <br/>
been wounded no fewer then forty times over the course of career, <br/>
which came to an end when he died of illness in June 1561 at Kaizu <br/>
Castle.<br/>
<br/>
OBATA Masamori 1534-1582 <br/>
Masamori was the son of Obata Toranori and a noted general of Takeda <br/>
Shingen. For some time he acted as Kosaka Masanobu's second in <br/>
command at Kaizu Castle in northern Shinano Province. He was wounded <br/>
at the Battle of Nagashino and eventually died of illness. He was <br/>
married to a daughter of Hara Toratane.<br/>
<br/>
OBATA Nobusada 1540-1592 <br/>
Nobusada joined the Takeda around 1560 after fleeing his lands in <br/>
K么zuke Province. He had his old fief restored to him by Shingen the <br/>
following year and proved to be one of Shingen's most dependable <br/>
generals. He led large forces at the Battles of Mimasetoge and <br/>
Mikatagahara and was very useful in the Takeda's K么zuke campaigns. He <br/>
commanded somewhere around 500 men at the Battle of Nagashino for <br/>
Takeda Katsuyori. When the Takeda fell in 1582, he joined first <br/>
Takigawa Kazumasa and then the H么j么, finally ending up with Sanada <br/>
Masayuki (1590).<br/>
<br/>
OBATA Kagenori 1570-1644<br/>
Kagenori became a Tokugawa retainer following the fall of the Takeda <br/>
and was made a page to Tokugawa Hidetada. He is reputed to have been <br/>
sent to the Osaka garrison as a spy by the Tokugawa. Kagenori is <br/>
attributed with writing at least part (if not most) of the Koyo <br/>
Gunkan, the well-known history of the Takeda of Kai in the 16th <br/>
Century (which is sometimes also attributed to Kosaka Masanobu).<br/>

First, what is the 'Sengoku Jinmei Jiten'--from the context, it's a <br/>

would be very helpful (year written, ect.).<br/>
<br/>
Second, you noted that Obata Nobusada was the son of O. Shigesada--<br/>
once source I have listed "O. Norishige" as Nobusada's father. <br/>
Are "Shigesada" and "Norishige" the same person? Also, are there any <br/>
dates (b/d) for him? (BTW, I noted I erroneously wrote "Nobushige" in <br/>
my earlier post--sumimasen!). <br/>

Third, and last, are the Toramori et.al. and Shigesada/Nobusada lines <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1193467315">The 'Sengoku Jinmei Jiten' is a biographical dictionary of Sengoku <br/>
Samurai that I picked up in kyoto.  I wouldn't call it the 'be all, <br/>
end all' of biographies, because there are about 8000 names in there, <br/>
and so it only dedicates from 1 or 2 lines to a paragraph to each one.<br/>
First edition 1990 (I have the 12th edition, 2000) by Abe Takeshi.<br/>
<br/>
As for the Obata Norishige / Obata Nobusada relation, I'm not sure <br/>
how they are related.  They were both retainers of the Takeda, <br/>
however unless I'm missing something, they were not father and son. <br/>
It looks like Norishige joined the takeda in 1560, and was killed at <br/>
Nagashino.<br/>
<br/>
This is all the relationships I can find in the Obata:<br/>
<br/>
Toramori (D.1561)<br/>
Sons:<br/>
1.Mitsumori (fled to Echigo after the 1582 fall of the Takeda)<br/>
2.Masamori (1538-1582)<br/>

One additional comment on the following:<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Under the mini-bio on Obata Nobusada on the Samurai Archives, it <br/>
noted something to the effect that "Nobusada's father, Norishige, was <br/>
killed at Nagashino." I know that warriors had a penchant for <br/>
changing names when life events inspired them and thought that <br/>
perhaps "Norishige" and "Shigesada' might be the same person. <br/>
     However, some of my more central questions have been answered, <br/>
so I guess I can merely note what's reported from both sources. <br/>
I guess that any relationship between the Toramori, et. al. line and <br/>
the Nobusada line can likewise be reported as unknowns.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>If that's possible, that would be great! As prevoiously noted, I can<br/>
simply report the relationship between those two individuals (and the <br/>
two Obata lines) as "suspect, but unconfirmed". However, it would <br/>
really be a treat to be able to settle it all a bit more <br/>
definitively. <br/>
<br/>
Thanks for your efforts on this--I'll hold off on the wrap-up of my <br/>
project for a bit in case any more clues emerge.<br/>
