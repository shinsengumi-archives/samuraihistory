<h3>Samurai and swordsmen</h3>
by <i>thomas_tessera</i>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1090080537">I think in these recent discussions about the sword we must <br/>
delineate between samurai, as members of a social caste and <br/>
thus in possession of the title by birthright or promotion,<br/>
and swordsmen - who did not necessarily belong to the samurai <br/>
caste - who pursued the 'art of the sword' as a vocation.<br/>

my sleep, an eternal vigil.<br/>

<br/>
About samurai we can say that some embodied the highest ideals <br/>
of nobility and self-sacrifice, and that some embodied every <br/>
notion of a particularly brutal brigand, and that by far the <br/>
anonymous majority fell somewhere in the midground between the <br/>
two.<br/>
<br/>
In the same way we can say that certain ages or eras bore a <br/>
characteristic trait of the warrior class. Its virtues were <br/>
permanently established by Yoritomo - he required that his <br/>
warriors lead the simple life, avoid display, exhibit a high <br/>
degree of physical and moral courage, maintain their martial <br/>
readiness at all times, and serve with unswerving loyalty.<br/>
<br/>
Its vices were established almost simultaneously - the tactical <br/>
genius of his younger brother Yoshitsune was the living model <br/>
of the classical warrior espoused by his brother - yet <br/>
Yoshitsune - and the ideal - was betrayed by Yoshimoto who <br/>
succumbed to the personal and political expediency of removing <br/>
any potential opponent from the field, innocent or otherwise.<br/>
<br/>
This tension between loyalty and self-serving ambition <br/>
characterises the samurai from that moment on - an arc that <br/>
began to fall from the moment of Yoshitsune's death and <br/>
continued in its downward arc, with ever but a few bright <br/>
exceptions, towards its lowest ebb at the close of the Sengoku <br/>
- a decline brought to a halt by the establishment of the <br/>
Tokugawa bakafu.<br/>
<br/>
From here the whole fallen image of the noble warrior was <br/>
reconstructed along new lines and with a new expression, <br/>
demanding a moral example (in times of peace) in place of the <br/>
martial example (in times of war) - Do, not jutsu - the way <br/>
rather than the art. <br/>
<br/>
My perspective on the samurai is always that of the swordsman, <br/>
but in my mind it is only against the background of his place <br/>
and time that the brilliance of these men shines forth in all <br/>
its true colour.<br/>
<br/>
I also happily acknowledge that, by the same token, there were <br/>
samurai in every age who stood as exemplars of their calling, <br/>
without ever having to prove themselves by the carriage of arms.<br/>
<br/>
yours, waxing lyrically,<br/>

Thomas -<br/>
	at the risk of spoiling the mystique (sorry, couldn't resist) of the<br/>
oblique manner in which your lyricism here addresses its object (its subject<br/>
being quite delightfully clear)... permit me to ask how you see this<br/>
pertaining to recent conversations.  Please note that I'm intrigued, not<br/>
dubious.<br/>
	And that's a marvelous little essay.  If you aren't published, you ought to<br/>
give it some thought. (If you are, what've you written?)<br/>
