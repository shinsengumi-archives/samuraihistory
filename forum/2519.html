 </span></blockquote>Yes. Grab your phonebook, look up "kendo/aikido/iado" and look for a dojo.<br/>

You can't learn this stuff without a teacher.<br/>

<h3>Re: [samuraihistory] Samurai History</h3>
by <i>cepooooo</i>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-616092256">For something about 'everyday samurai,' I always suggest Katsu Koichi's <br/>
"Musui's Story, the autobiography of a Tokugawa Samurai." Some parts of <br/>
Fukuzawa Yukichi's autobiography are very enlightening as well.<br/>
<br/>
For a general overview I suggest:<br/>
- William Farris' "Heavenly Warriors"<br/>
- Eiko Ikegami's "The Taming of the Samurai"<br/>
- Paul Varley's "Warriors of Japan" - this one deals with how warriors <br/>
were portrayed in tales.<br/>
<br/>
Steve Turnbull and Karl Friday have written a few easily approachable <br/>
comprehensive books, but their work is a bit too mainstream, and <br/>
historically I found them less reliable of the three above.<br/>
<br/>
For weapons and fighting technique, of course the Osprey's are <br/>
unmatched.<br/>
<br/>
Finally, avoid "Bushid�" and "Hagakure," as they are read as holy <br/>
scriptures, but they are about the "myth" of the Samurai, NOT about <br/>
real Samurai life. Just like "A Book of Five Rings," these original <br/>
treaties are understandable only after one has a good grasp on Japanese <br/>
history. I am not saying that these books are not good, but some people <br/>
read ONLY them, and think they 'know' about Samurai then... In case, is <br/>
easier to watch "Shogun," or "The Last Samurai."<br/>
<br/>
These are the books, anyway I hope you listen to what Tony said as <br/>
well, as I agree 100% with him. NOTHING about East Asia can be really <br/>
understood without direct practice, since the Way in which knowledge is <br/>
transmitted in Japan (and China, etc.) is never limited to texts.<br/>
<br/>
Hope it helped,<br/>
