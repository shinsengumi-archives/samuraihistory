Subject: RE: Japan eras<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
*snip* HAHAHAHA its amazing how we can all be talking about swords and stuff<br/>
and my spelling some how becomes a topic. Hmm... ... GOD BLESS YOU ALL.<br/>
*snip*<br/>
James, this is not all that amazing.  One of the ideals of the samurai was<br/>
_bunbu ichi_ (I've also seen that transliterated as _bunbu no ichi_, and if<br/>
any of you who're  moderately fluent in Japanese can tell me which is more<br/>
correct, I'll be most grateful.)  This has been translated as "pen and sword<br/>
in harmony."<br/>
You see, it is not enough to know how to swing a sword.  Even if you regard<br/>
your blade with the deepest respect, even if you practise endlessly, that is<br/>
only a beginning.  You must also attain some cultural accomplishments:  to<br/>
be able to compose poetry, say, or to draw well.  A samurai who couldn't<br/>
exhibit basic literacy would not have been well regarded in polite society.<br/>
Something for you to consider.  When you're spelling your steel 'steal,' it<br/>
is a natural reaction for literate people to disregard or discount your<br/>
input.  It's hard to take seriously the input of anyone who's a native<br/>
English speaker and still can't manage to express himself better than you<br/>
seem to be able to do.<br/>
Now I'm not saying this to insult you, but to suggest that you may want to<br/>
take even more care in improving your spelling and grammar skills.  To<br/>
teach, you must first learn.  And - since you mentioned being of African<br/>
descent - bear in mind that you're in a country that still has a vicious<br/>
tendency to regard you as somehow not as smart as some other guy whose only<br/>
virtue is that his skin is lighter than yours.  (I don't think I'm telling<br/>
you anything you don't know already, but I want to be clear.)  You're<br/>
fighting stereotype, and to do that you must excel in everything.  They used<br/>
to say much the same of women:  to earn half as much as a man, a woman has<br/>
to do twice as well...  So I'm not talking about race here, but about<br/>
prejudice... and about feeding prejudice through any appearance of ignorance<br/>
or incompetency.  Sure, your spelling is no worse than many folks I've seen<br/>
posting online... but your heredity and your choice of profession put you in<br/>
a spotlight that will, in many eyes, magnify every error you make.  You may<br/>
well find - in fact, I profoundly hope you do find - that being able to<br/>
spell and punctuate may make the difference between being able to find<br/>
yourself a teaching job and being unable to find a school that wants<br/>
anything to do with you.<br/>
I encourage you to grow into your pride.  Keep working on turning "some how"<br/>
into "somehow," "steal" into "steel"  - the spell-checker won't catch those,<br/>
but you need to.  And study the correct usage of apostrophes:  you're really<br/>
weak on those.  Our country needs good teachers, not more functional<br/>
illiterates.<br/>
May the gods bless you also.  I call particularly on all deities who value<br/>
knowledge and literacy to smile upon you and lead you on in the ways of<br/>
truth.<br/>

~Yami<br/>
<br/>
Yami, for what it's worth, you are far from alone.  Probably a third of my<br/>
students over the years have regarded their swords in something of this<br/>
light.  And every serious sworder I've ever known , European and Oriental<br/>
stylists alike, has done so.  I don't think you can practise for long (at<br/>
least not with any decent piece of steel) without coming to understand<br/>
something of the individual characters and distinctive personalities of<br/>
swords.  It is not coincidence that so many swords, all over the world, have<br/>
been given names.<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Ah, but that's the whole point. "Bunbu ichi" was not a set rule. It was a <br/>
controversy. There were many houses that openly eschewed any appearance of the <br/>
"soft, poofy stuff" -- Some houses even maintained draconian punishments like <br/>
banishment or forced seppuku for those caught studying literature or playing <br/>
games or musical instruments; they deemed these pastimes as "unworthy" of the <br/>
warrior.<br/>
<br/>
Other houses felt that, well, "bunbu ichi."<br/>

<br/>
One of the coolest things ever: The first two years I lived in Japan, I was in <br/>
Tokyo's far west suburbs, not too far from (Da)saitama. There was one stretch of <br/>
track on the Seibu-Ikebukuro Line that was elevated -- somewhere near Nerima, I <br/>
think. If you take the train at the right time in the late afternoon, you hit <br/>
the elevated section while the sun is going down behind Mt. Fuji. WAAAAAAY off <br/>
in the distance the sky is orange, with that distinctive silhouette on the <br/>
horizon. It was a view to live for.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-693892086">Thank you. Before I could not understand your criticism but now I see things in a whole new light. That is of course what learning is about. And I am well knowledgeable of "bunbu". I was thought it was the twin ways of the pen and sword but that the same thing you are saying. However, I have already took these into consideration and since this issue of my spelling aroused when I spelled a Japanese word wrong it seemed you got picky. Not to start any thing but alot of people make spelling mistakes. But enough about that let me talk about culturalistic Japan some too. I loved Japan and lets see I have a bit I want to share. Hmm lets see how to aproach... when you guys train do you train first your how do you say external or internal. What I am saying is do any one here do any traing of the chi or Ki, for it a Japanese site. OK wait I know that if you train in external arts then you will be naturally strengthening your internal abilities but i guess you already see the question thank<br/>
 you. We are the same in so much yet different in so many aspects. GOD BLESS ALL<br/>

Yami, for what it's worth, you are far from alone.  Probably a third of my<br/>
students over the years have regarded their swords in something of this<br/>
light.  And every serious sworder I've ever known , European and Oriental<br/>
stylists alike, has done so.  I don't think you can practise for long (at<br/>
least not with any decent piece of steel) without coming to understand<br/>
something of the individual characters and distinctive personalities of<br/>
swords.  It is not coincidence that so many swords, all over the world, have<br/>
been given names.<br/>

once--it was pretty messy.<br/>
<br/>
In Korea, it was little kids. I had a friend up in the<br/>
tower controlling when someone said "what's that" as<br/>
they looked through the camera--some 5 year old kid is<br/>
wandering down range, picking up the aluminum from the<br/>
sabot petals to recycle...<br/>
