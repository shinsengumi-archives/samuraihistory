<h3>Samurai swords in cement</h3>

<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1281383710">Group,<br/>
<br/>
According to a Nisei in 1946, several high-ranking Japanese officers in Korea buried their Samurai swords in cement prior to being repatriated to Japan. These swords were supposedly buried in the third step of a stairway in a building somewhere in Seoul. <br/>
<br/>
The Nisei, presumably a member of the Military Intelligence Service (MIS), expressed an interest in locating the building and excavating the swords. He thought the swords might be valuable.<br/>
<br/>
Has anyone ever heard this rumor before? If so, were the swords found?<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-374673966">It would be almost difficult to find those cement-buried swords in Seoul these days. Except for a few historical buildings, very little survives from the Japanese period. Those swords would have been found by now and made the newspapers.<br/>
<br/>
A few years after the Japanese departed, the North Koreans first, and then the Chinese passed through Seoul before the Korean war ended in a stalemate. Maybe they were found then and sold to foreign soldier.<br/>
<br/>
Hmmm, wonder if I did start a rumor concerning them using used chopsticks to start a bbq fire would anyone be interested in locating those burnt embers?<br/>
