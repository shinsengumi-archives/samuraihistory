about things, Yuya recalled about finding the rare three chambered <br/>
revolver amongst her brother's stuff after he was killed. He apparently <br/>
got it from a Mibu (In Rurouni Kenshin and Peacemaker the Shinsengumi <br/>
were called the Wolves of Mibu) and that's what Kyoshiro's last name <br/>
is. Cannot wait for eppy 26. Next one is 18 or 19. Supposedly the gun <br/>
mystery will be made clear to all. Toodles-K&K<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1522541008">-At long last I have the answer to that old question of mine- Could <br/>
Yuya Shiina the bounty hunter gal from Samurai Deepr Kyo really have <br/>
possessed such a weapon like that triple rotating barrel flintlock <br/>
pistol she used and would she have been in violation of Shogunate <br/>
Japanese law at the time?<br/>
<br/>
Thanks to google and wikipedia-- the answers are yes and no.<br/>
<br/>
First- Yes she could have owned such a weapon since multi-barrelled <br/>
flintlock pistols were used by many at that time notably pirates <br/>
(duck's foot four barrel pistols et al)<br/>
<br/>
Second- No she (and Megeira with his futuristic volley gun) would <br/>
have been wirhin Shogunate Law since NobuNaga did not outlaw firearms <br/>
and foreigners in Japan until he united the clans after the great war <br/>
in 1615. The Battle of Sekigahara was in 1600 and SDK is set to begin <br/>
four years after that battle (1604) so at least then Yuya and Megeira <br/>
were not breaking any laws of that period in Japanese Shogunate <br/>
history. <br/>
<br/>
Here are the sites I found my info on:-<br/>
