<h3>A Period in Japanese History</h3>
by <i>ryer71</i>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1551530011">Crew,<br/>
<br/>
     I am interested in writing a story regarding Samurai.<br/>
I am unsure as to which period in Japanese history to write<br/>
about. Pre Tokugawa? Tokugawa? After America sought trade?<br/>
Between Edo and Kyoto, I am unsure which city would be more<br/>
interesting. Edo is a distance from Kyoto. Did more action<br/>
take place in and/or around Kyoto? I can look within an<br/>
encyclopedias but I would rather focus on one time period<br/>
at a time; I get overwhelmed. You folks can supply me with<br/>
more detail in certain areas than an encyclopedia can. I<br/>
would appreciate your time and knowledge. Thank you.<br/>

<br/>
1. Know the story you want to tell first.<br/>
2. Put the setting in the period where it belongs.<br/>
3. Make the setting the place that is appropriate.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Then I suggest that you don't have a story to tell. You just want to tell a<br/>
story.<br/>
<br/>
Again, please remember that I speak from years in the business. Unless *you*<br/>
know what story you want to tell, you are kidding yourself and wasting time.<br/>
<br/>
While there may be ideas that you can get from any particular period, it<br/>
depends on *your* interests and what makes *you* excited.<br/>
<br/>
We can't tell you that.<br/>
<br/>
All we can do is say what *we* find interesting, which does nothing to<br/>
further *your* goals of telling a story....<br/>
<br/>
A story *you* don't even yet know!<br/>
<br/>
Frankly, I could fill a cruise ship with the number of people who wanted to<br/>
write the Great American Novel, if they only had something to write about.<br/>

<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-784436663">Having just stated that I have a heaving bookshelf of novels....... This is<br/>
not a novel in the full sense but rather "faction" - a very interesting way<br/>
of portraying events in the Inn by using little playlets. I would recommend<br/>
it to light readers as well as serious readers. I have a copy from 1961,<br/>
published in New York by Random House. In it I have kept a review by a<br/>
literature critic of the time (in the Daily Telegraph I think). I thought it<br/>
might be of interest, as an aside the cost then was 35s - £1.75 in sterling<br/>
now or about $2.50:<br/>
<br/>
JAPANESE INN. By Oliver Statler. (.Secker and Warburg. 35s.)<br/>
<br/>
FOR Mr. Statler in 1947, a fortyeight-hour pass meant not the fleshpots of<br/>
Tokyo but a week-end in a village inn; and the trip into the countryside,<br/>
often repeated, soon became a trip into the feudal past. The inn was the<br/>
Minaguchi-ya, in the village of Okitsu, on the Tokaido highway linking the<br/>
old Imperial capital of Kyoto with Edo, the Shogunate site of modern Tokyo.<br/>
<br/>
In electing to write a history of the Minaguchi-ya Mr. Statler could<br/>
scarcely avoid anthologising most of the more colourful episodes and<br/>
characters in the Japanese calendar. There is no denying the fascination of<br/>
this material, which will be familiar only to students of things Japanese.<br/>
It is all written up with a vividness that captures what is bloody minded as<br/>
well as what is charming in this culture of ascetic aestheticism.<br/>
<br/>
Many generations of the Mochizuki family played host here to such eccentrics<br/>
as Ieyasu Tokugawa, Will Adams, the Zen poet Basho, Dr. Kaempfer, and<br/>
Hiroshige, whose views of the Tokaido liberally illustrate these pages. More<br/>
tenuously linked to the fortunes of the inn are the many period politicos<br/>
and the European bagmen and missionaries, with their serio-comical<br/>
squabbles. The inn was awash with blood during the police terror of 1651. In<br/>
1705 the teenagers were on the march; a compulsive crusade of three and a<br/>
half millions passed by en route to Ise. Of such little-known incidents is<br/>
this entertaining and unusual volume composed. It is decorated with the<br/>
satirical brush sketches of Jichosai, an agreeably astringent foil to the<br/>
woodcuts of Hiroshige, Hokusai, Kuniyoshi and Moronobu.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-429327548">I have read the book and like the other reply found the book good "faction"<br/>
of Japanese history: maybe not a scholarly work but a definite<br/>
recommendation for anyone interested in Japanese History. It has also been<br/>
in the bibliographies of more serious works. (I'm surprised Kitsuno dono<br/>
never heard of it) He also wrote a very readable work about Townsend Harris<br/>
called 'Shimoda Story'. From what I've read Statler can be considered<br/>
amateur expert on Japan. He came here<br/>
with the occupation and spent many years here afterwards, a lot more time<br/>
then 'those' with phds.<br/>

     I thank you very much for your time and recommendation<br/>
in this matter. My problem is determining what time period<br/>
to write the story in. Should I tell the story after the<br/>
Samurai were "decommisioned?" Before? Their hardships and<br/>
challenges in doing right or wrong? Their dishonorable <br/>
temptations? Of a sub plot to overthrow Ieyasu and restore<br/>
the previous shogunate? Those are my dilemas.<br/>
