I've tried to find it too.  Go to the above link.  You'll find more <br/>
information about it there.  The creator of this page; however, was less <br/>
than thrilled about the movie.  I know the VHS version exists (but for <br/>
around 79.00).  I think it was at Amazon.com but I'm probably wrong.  Good <br/>
luck searching.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-916013089">There is a film about Takeda Shingen and Uesugi Kenshin named "Kagetora", which as all of you know was the name of kenshin before being adopted by the uesugi clan; it has quite good photography and fighting scenes, and a representation of the 4th battle of Kawanakajima, featuring a personal duel between Shingen and Kenshin; is that it?, it was produced by MGM.<br/>
Hope this helps.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-393086445">Hi.<br/>
  Uhm, something that has always caused me to wonder: We talk about the <br/>
Fourth Battle of Kawanakajima, but what happened to the first THREE?  I'm not <br/>
trying to be a smart@$$, but it's something I have wondered about.  Thanks.<br/>

   Can you understand Japanese and do you have (or have access to) a <br/>
region 2 DVD player?  If so, I may be able to find it in Japan.<br/>
     Just let me know,<br/>
