This in answer to both your note here and to a respondent who came along<br/>
later:  over the past thirty years I've handled a number of blades made in<br/>
Toledo, both good ones and bad, and I'll assure you that this site is simply<br/>
using the name of the city.  I have no doubt at all that the smiths of<br/>
Toledo in Spain are still forging fine blades, as they have been doing for<br/>
hundreds of years... and I also do not doubt that some of them are<br/>
simultaneously turning out pieces of wall-hanger pot-metal for tourists'<br/>
walls.  All the same, I'd hate to see anyone's opinion of Toledo blades,<br/>
which can be very fine indeed, shaped by this fairly standard selection of<br/>
pop-steel.  Feel free to contact me off-list if you'd like a few better<br/>
places to look.<br/>
And on the other hand, anyone who has contact information for any of the<br/>
smiths of Toledo, please feel free to contact me also.<br/>

 </span></blockquote> Thank you, Nate, I am interested in swords, can't say that I'm not.<br/>
I don't know much, so an expert's opinion would be most welcome. I<br/>
like the www.toledoswords.com site, mostly because it's one of the<br/>
few I have visited (so I only know about their opinion). Is it ok?<br/>
 Oh, and don't be afraid, as I have no intention on getting freaky, I<br/>
just like to learn about the historical events that have taken place<br/>
throughout the world, and in that matter the Discovery Channel has<br/>
been of great help ;)<br/>
 I am also very interested in sailships, but that does not make the<br/>
object of this forum, so sorry I've mentioned it.<br/>
<br/>
 Respectfully,<br/>
<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-101841069">Hello Gereg,<br/>
<br/>
  I'm sorry I rushed to write about that site, because on further <br/>
examination, I have discovered that it is a fake. My mistake...Thank <br/>
you for helping me and tell me what do you think of this site:<br/>
www.jidai.jp, although I'm having difficulties at this time buying a <br/>
300 Euros sword...So the site is just a dream, besides, since I don't <br/>
take any Kendo or any alike, I wouldn't know what to do with a sword, <br/>
but to admire its beauty.<br/>
<br/>
  Sorry again, and I hope I have redeemed myself in your eyes :)<br/>
<br/>
  Respectfully,<br/>
<br/>
  Gabriel<br/>
