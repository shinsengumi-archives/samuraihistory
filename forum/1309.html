NHK have produced any dramas on Inoue Kaoru, Takasugi <br/>
Shinsaku or Ito Hirobume (all pupils of Yoshida Shoin in <br/>
Choshu).<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1455037387">For NHK Taiga drama some of them are available on video in a condensed form<br/>
( remember they are originally 49 episodes)<br/>
<br/>
Try this site <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.amuse-soft.co.jp/">http://www.amuse-soft.co.jp/</a>  but be warned they are only in<br/>
Japanese and are very expensive. If you are still in Yamaguchi Ken I am sure<br/>
you can find most of them at any big video rental shop.<br/>
<br/>
Taiga Drama has been around since 1962. of the forty plus drams the ones you<br/>
might be interested in are;<br/>
<br/>
Kashin (1977) this was about Choshu in the Bakumatsu period<br/>
<br/>
Tobu ga yuku (1990) Saigo Takamori<br/>
<br/>
Shishi no Jidai (1980) Aizu-Wakamatsu<br/>
<br/>
Some other bakumatsu Taiga dramas not available on video are Hana no shogai<br/>
(II Naosuke) Ryoma ga Yuku (Sakamoto Ryoma) Katsu Kaishu, and Tokugawa<br/>
Yoshinobu.<br/>
<br/>
In addition to the year long Taiga drama NHK also does a 2 hourspecial for<br/>
shogatsu. 2000 was Tenkoku no Yume about Yoshida Shoin and Takasugi<br/>
Shinsaku.<br/>
<br/>
On other channels there have been a plethora of jidai gekis about the<br/>
bakumatsu period. I have about 130 titles courtesy mostly Seimon Jidai Geki<br/>
Channel. There have been many dramas about Takasugi Shinsaku, Yoshida Shoin,<br/>
Kiheitai, as well as the shinsengumi, Sakamoto Ryoma, Goryo kaku etc etc.<br/>
Currently the Family Channel has been airing Tenno no Seki from 1970. This<br/>
is all about the period the Black ships on.</div>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-611147845">Just got the new TV Guide for shogatsu. NHK is repeating in condensed form<br/>
the Taiga dramas of Nobunaga (1992) Hideyoshi (1996) and Tokugawa Ieyasu<br/>
(1983) on the 3,4, and 5 of January. In addition its shogatsu jidai geki is<br/>
about Oguri Kozunosuke (he was Kastu Kaishus rival in the bakumatsu period)<br/>
this is on the 3rd.</div>

> <br/>
> Thanks so much for all the information. It reminded me how <br/>
 </span></blockquote>well-informed so many people in this forum are, and how <br/>
generous they are with their time and knowledge. I'm going <br/>
into Yamaguchi tomorrow and will have a look for video <br/>
rentals. The nearest from here is about 40 ks,( or maybe I <br/>
should say 10 ri as I'm livng the life of a Yamaguchi <br/>
obaachan and going everywhere on foot or on a bicycle.) <br/>
And I'm going back to Australia on Sunday so won't be able <br/>
to watch the NHK dramas over New Year. I did see the <br/>
excerpts from the one on Oguri on Sono Toki last month, also <br/>
one on Omura (can't remember his given name. )<br/>
<br/>
Another couple of questions. I'm reading a biography of <br/>
Inoue Kaoru by Monma Koudou. Does anyone know of him <br/>
as a historian?<br/>
<br/>
And he mentions "jirai"  - landmines?? (that's what the kanji <br/>
read) What sort of landmines would Choshu have had in <br/>
1864 and where would they have got them?<br/>
<br/>
Thanks again.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-797562720">I don't know if it is what Choshu had, but "land<br/>
mines", in the 1860's, were quite different from what<br/>
we know them as today. Generally, military engineers<br/>
dug tunnels, or "mines" underneath enemy<br/>
fortificattions, filled them with explosives, and blew<br/>
them up, with the intent of breaching walls, etc.<br/>
Explosives with proximity fuses or trip wires, set in<br/>
the ground, to destroy moving enemy troops or vehicles<br/>
like we see today did not make a common appearance<br/>
until WWI, as far as I know. <br/>
<br/>
Doesn't exactly answer your question, but that's the<br/>
best I've got.<br/>
