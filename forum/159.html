<h3>Samurai Armor?</h3>
by <i>lady_lethal</i>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-2142311350">Hello guys!<br/>
<br/>
My name is Yuri and i love the Japanese culture, samurais, animes and stuff!<br/>
Im here to trade infos with you and because Im needing a little help! <br/>
Im doing a research about Samurais/Armor/Swords/Zen&Art. In the end of this year all this material will transform into a cdrom. We'll try to talk about design, function, shape and art in the japanese Armor and Swords.<br/>
I have a lot of books and sites and materials, but I didnt find the information about: armor and the eras.<br/>
Id like to know when(year, era?) each kind of armor appeared. I have a list with lots and lots of armor styles without dates.<br/>
If anybody knows this dates or a book where I can find it, or a site, please, send me an email at <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="mailto:ladylethal@...">ladylethal@...</a><br/>
Thats very important! :-)<br/>
<br/>
Thanx everybody!<br/>
I hope that I can help you too with my knowing about samurais.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-540700026">Hey Yuri ...<br/>
    Something you might want to add to your armor and swords would be other<br/>
types of weapons. During their initial training, a samurai learned the<br/>
sword, halberd, jo, and boken (although the boken was more for sword<br/>
training than anything else, it was still a weapon in its own right). A<br/>
young Japanese warrior would be equally proficient in the use of a halberd<br/>
as he would be in the sword.<br/>
    Look back to the province of Aizu. They had two major schools restricted<br/>
to the Aizu and Takeda clans. One was the Takeda school of Ochikiuchi. The<br/>
other was the Aizu school of Onaha Itto ryu, which taught the use of the<br/>
sword and halberd.<br/>
    Please make a note of my email address. When you have the cd rom<br/>
completed, I would be interested in purchasing a copy. I am working on a<br/>
ficticious novel dated in the mid to late 1500s, and I will need some of the<br/>
information you are collecting.<br/>
<br/>
I wish you all the best.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-37829597">Hi Yuri<br/>
<br/>
Tall Order!! Sounds like you are trying to run before walking.... proceed<br/>
with care.<br/>
<br/>
As a starting point  I could point you to two works:<br/>
                            "Oriental Armour": H. Russell Robinson (1967)<br/>
                            "The Manufacture of Arms & Armour in 16th<br/>
Century Japan":<br/>
                                    Revised and edited by H. Russell<br/>
Robinson (1962)<br/>
an easy to read book following your basic outline is:-<br/>
                             "The Way of the Samurai": Richard Storry (1978)<br/>
<br/>
Three books published by Osprey are easy to obtain at reasonable cost:<br/>
                               "Samurai Armies": Stephen Turnbull (check out<br/>
Stephen's Web Site)<br/>
                                "The Samurai": Anthony J. Bryant<br/>
                                "Samurai 1550-1600": Anthony J. Bryant<br/>
<br/>
I feel sure you will have other suggestion from our collegues, keep in<br/>
touch..<br/>
<br/>
Best wishes,<br/>
                            Rod Johnson<br/>

<br/>
I'm leery of recommending the site specifically because Yuri mentioned making a<br/>
CD-ROM. I don't mind using the files here for reference or research, but I<br/>
*don't* want them appearing on someone's CD-ROM.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1865497963">YURI et al,<br/>
    I would also suggest ARMS AND ARMOUR OF THE SAMURAI by BOTTOMLEY and HOPSON<br/>
one of the better books in english. For schools , dates and genealogies try Kei<br/>
Kaneda Chappelears ARMOR MAKERS OF THE SAMURAI, taken from the works of Sasama<br/>
Yoshihiko this is a must have for "English only" collectors.<br/>
