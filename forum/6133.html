<h3>Or, humbled...</h3>
by <i>yeomanforbes</i>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-458286255">It's interesting how humble you can feel when walking amidst <br/>
thousands upon thousands of books.  I wandered through the history <br/>
section of the lovely and art endowed Los Angeles County Central <br/>
Library (<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.lapl.org/central/art_architecture.html)">http://www.lapl.org/central/art_architecture.html)</a> which <br/>
was organized by country/region, and/or individual, and went from <br/>
the tumultous Koreans right into Japan.  One moment, it's all this <br/>
north-south damn-those-chinese-and-americans kind of talk, the next, <br/>
there's twigs and blossoms and peace.  Well, that's how it started, <br/>
but it soon grew ugly as the section broadened into warfare.  <br/>
Warfare, art, warfare, art... I understand you can study both, but <br/>
it seemed a curious mixture to have them interspaced.  There was a <br/>
theme here, but I couldn't quite lay my finger on it. (Of course, <br/>
going back a bit in the Korea section revealed that they, too, <br/>
shared no love of the Japanese, probably due to the twice a millenia <br/>
invasions by those folks.  What is so wonderful about Korea that the <br/>
Japanese kept invading it?)<br/>
<br/>
So I snagged Mr. Turnbull's Osprey book and "Samurai, A Military <br/>
History," also by that same worthy, and found that the Osprey book <br/>
was meaty reading for such a thin tome.  I suspect, from Turnbull's <br/>
many offerings, that he is an excellent gent to start with, and then <br/>
to branch out when my abundant free time is no longer taken up by <br/>
these books.  Suggestions, anyone?  (Or, if there's a reading list <br/>
compiled by some person, kindly direct me to it?)  <br/>
<br/>
After picking up those volumes, I wandered some more, and mused on <br/>
the fact that someone, somewhere, for some reason completely unknown <br/>
to me, thinks it important that we preserve the 1964 yellow pages <br/>
for Des Moines, Iowa.  Else, why have it available for checkout, in <br/>
a library created ugly brown cover, with black lettering?  If only <br/>
Andrew could see his progeny now, and think, "for this, I ruthlessly <br/>
crushed all other steel companies?"  Ah, but the rest of the place! <br/>
It was enough to humble your kind author.  I know so very little <br/>
about anything.  Soon, I will know a very little about this subject, <br/>
too.  :)<br/>
<br/>
Cheers.</div>

 </span></blockquote>Nothing. And I say that having lived their twice. It's<br/>
a 2 way road between Japan and the Asian<br/>
mainland--nobody in their right mind would invade<br/>
Korea simply to own that....place. If Japan owns it,<br/>
they control any Asian movement towards their country,<br/>
and can move into Asia. Same thing for the Chinese,<br/>
Russians, etc...<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Which Osprey book? He's got about 20 of them. <br/>
<br/>
 I suspect,<br/>

<br/>
One note of warning about Turnbull: He's mercurial,<br/>
and often times concerned with publication for<br/>
publication's sake. Much of his newer books are<br/>
rehashes of things he'd previously written, and some<br/>
are horribly edited. Many of his older books contain<br/>
numerous mistakes, some of which he has later<br/>
corrected. Questions have arisen about his "research"<br/>
in earlier books since they mirror other books by less<br/>
prolific authors. <br/>
<br/>
He's a good place to start, and some of his books are<br/>
fabulous: Samurai Invasion, Samurai Warriors, Samurai<br/>
Warlords, to name a few. In other ways, he simply<br/>
cashes in on what he can: Japanese Warfare from 1467;<br/>
Ninja (how can you say that ninja didn't walk around<br/>
in black pajamas, then have every picture in the book<br/>
be of a skulking sneak in black pajamas?), etc. <br/>
  <br/>
My own recommendations would be:<br/>
<br/>
George Sansom's series: dated, some places inaccurate,<br/>
but the best overall overview of Japanese history out<br/>
there for under $500. <br/>
<br/>
Mary Berry--Hideyoshi<br/>
<br/>
Anthony J. Bryant (I'm not his agent, but should be).<br/>
