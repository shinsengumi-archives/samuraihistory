<div id="ygrps-yiv-704002982">Thank you, Nate. I will check with Bottomley and Hopson.<br/>
<br/>
I just wanted to add, if the Seppuku topic is still relevant, that Paul Schrader has directed a film called 'Mishima' (produced by Francis F. Coppola and George-star-wars-Lucas). It revolves exactly around the drama in the military base, but also re-enacts three of his novel/plays, in an attempt to give a broader sense of his character, his sexual tendencies, and vision. It is wonderfully and very artistically done, and I recommend it to anyone who is interested in this writer. I would gladly discuss this more, though I don't want to veer off-topic of...Samurai History!<br/>
<br/>
Thank you, Gillian, for your kind invitation! I read as much as my brain assimilates (never enough!) although I know in advance that as a non-Japanese, or as an outsider to any investigated culture, I must pay the outmost respect, and be aware that any attempt to encompass it in its entirety will be lacking. Therefore, I (others can differ) must address this culture from the only point of view available to me, which is the outsider's.<br/>
