In a kake in that fashion usually the first blade from<br/>
up to down is the shortest one and is called "Tanto".<br/>
A small utilitarian knife, more a tool than a weapon.<br/>
But it does not mean that it could not be used as the<br/>
second.   The second blade a medium sized one, was<br/>
called "Wakisashi", it was a small katana made as<br/>
companion for the "Katana" which is the third one and<br/>
the longest in this fashion.<br/>
A double sword kake: whit a Wakisashi and a Katana, is<br/>
called a "Daisho" ( also when a person is using this,<br/>
it is said he is wearing a daisho ) in a Daisho <br/>

<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1225887409">Not sure if I 100% agree with that. A daisho on a katana-kake is normally<br/>
with the katana on the top and the wakizashi at the bottom, to make it<br/>
easier to pick up the katana in an emergency, in those days when these<br/>
things mattered. Sometimes the shoto of a daisho is a tanto and this is more<br/>
usual if the daito is a tachi, but it can be a tanto with a katana. How<br/>
swords were displayed on their racks in a samurai household would indicate<br/>
to any visitor the state of preparedness of the occupants and so it was an<br/>
important part of sword etiquette. Also I would certainly not describe a<br/>
tanto as "a small utilitarian knife more of a tool than a weapon". Tanto are<br/>
made in the same manner as other swords and are as magnificent as any other<br/>
blades, just smaller. They are certainly classed as a weapon and count<br/>
National Treasures amongst their number, some of which date back to the<br/>
Kamakura period and even earlier.<br/>
I may be misunderstanding the original question, but I have never, as far as<br/>
I can remember seen, 3 matching swords other than in the realm of cheap<br/>
modern reproductions.<br/>
I hope this does not contradict the samurai history subject of this list,<br/>
but I felt the points worth noting.<br/>

You are correct in this assumption. Normally when swords are "at rest" on a<br/>
katana-kake they would be placed with the omote (front) side of the blade<br/>
facing out, this means the kurikata is visible. Were it to be placed the<br/>
other way, ie easier to pick up as you describe, it would indicate a state<br/>
of high alert.<br/>
Also interesting are the various positions in which a katana is placed on<br/>
the floor at one's side when  kneeling in front of another.<br/>
You mention tachi, which are slightly different. A tachi, if on an ordinary<br/>
katana-kake is place with the cutting edge downwards so that it also<br/>
simulates the position when worn. More often and more correctly, a tachi is<br/>
placed on a different type of rack so that it can stand vertically, with the<br/>
tsuka (handle) resting in a small indentation on the base. It is incorrect<br/>
as is often seen, for the tsuka to be at the top when placed on a proper<br/>
tachi stand.<br/>

very interested to hear what would have been the correct practise in<br/>
this circumstance.<br/>
<br/>
Also on the topic of mounting tachi on a tachi-kake, you wrote:<br/>

 </span></blockquote>When I owned but one sword, my other half bought me a tachi-kake to<br/>
display it. I was aware at the time of how to correctly use it, but out<br/>
of curiosity I experimented with mounting it the wrong way round, to see<br/>
if I could deduce the reasoning behind the practise. I found two things,<br/>
(a) the end of the saya (kojiri?) would try to escape from the small<br/>
indentation in the base, and (b) due to the point of balance being<br/>
somewhat higher than it should be, the sword was easily dislodged.<br/>
Needless to say ever since, I've always done as you previously outlined.<br/>
<br/>
Incidentally would I be right in thinking that a large weapon like a no-<br/>
dachi/ou-dachi would also be displayed on a tachi-kake?<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-2117024717">Dean<br/>
Once again I crave the indulgence of the moderator if this is considered a<br/>
little off-topic for this list, however....<br/>
Basically if sitting in seiza opposite another, it was customary to remove<br/>
the katana from the obi and place it at your side, although, on entering<br/>
another residence, the sword might be given to a page or servant for safe<br/>
storage to be collected when leaving. It was OK to keep the shoto in the obi<br/>
as a samurai would never be totally unarmed. Dependant on which side the<br/>
long  sword was placed indicated the state of preparedness. Basically, if<br/>
removed from the obi and placed on your right-hand side, this was taken as<br/>
being relaxed and no threat. If on the left hand side, then a greater level<br/>
of preparedness was indicated, but precisely how it was placed, upped the<br/>
level. For instance if the back of the sword was closest to your left side,<br/>
this was less intimidating than if the curve was away from you as, in this<br/>
circumstance, it would be unnecessary to turn the sword before drawing it.<br/>
This could seem quite a threatening position. Further, if the left thumb had<br/>
pushed the tsuba so that the habaki (collar) was clear of the koi-guchi<br/>
(scabbard mouth), then this was most threatening and meant that the owner<br/>
was fully anticipating that he would need to draw his sword! If he then<br/>
raised up onto his toes, coming out of the "safe" seiza position, he was<br/>
about to fight.<br/>
Sword etiquette was very important to the samurai as usually nobody wanted<br/>
accidentally to become involved in situations where blood was shed. It is<br/>
probable that the rules of etiquette were refined and structured in the<br/>
Togugawa period where the only action likely to occur was in a one-on-one<br/>
situation, but here I speculate somewhat. Rules of sword etiquette  still<br/>
applies today although the bloody consequences of poor etiquette are less<br/>
likely, however, good etiquette shows the difference between the educated<br/>
gentlemen and the less well educated. It is unlikely that you will be able<br/>
to view important swords in Japan (on a hands-on basis) such as National<br/>
Treasures etc.unless you have already shown that you fall into the "educated<br/>
gentleman" catagory.<br/>
As for No-dachi, I guess they can do whatever they want!! although more<br/>
seriously, I prefer a katana-kake as oversized swords are less well balanced<br/>
on a tachi-kake.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Sounds like a sensible policy. I've seen modern katana-kake designed for<br/>
a single sword, but did such things exist earlier? You sometimes see<br/>
large calibre teppou displayed on stands like this.<br/>

I believe you are correct about inns, tea-houses etc., there would be such a<br/>
provision. In fact in my house, I have a vistor's rack, but few arrive at<br/>
the door with a sword in their obi these days. Actually I keep it for swords<br/>
which are in my care for whatever reason, but that I do not own - call me<br/>
old fashioned!!<br/>
I do have a couple of antique single sword racks but to be perfectly honest<br/>
I could not swear they were made to accomodate swords, maybe mirrors or<br/>
scrolls or some such. I also have a rack for 5 swords, which is very handy,<br/>
a couple for 3 but mostly just for 2 swords. Naginata and yari all go on the<br/>
wall.<br/>
