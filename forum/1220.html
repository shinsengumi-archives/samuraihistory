<div id="ygrps-yiv-1354278308">Got a question: in 1600 Ieyasu met Mr Adams and his cargo of gunpowder and ammunitions; what happened to Mr Adams after Sekigahara and the establishment of the tokugawa shogunate?<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1280093472">I have a dog-eared old paperback "Japanese Inn" by Oliver <br/>
Staler about the Mochizuke family, starting with a sixteenth <br/>
century samurai in the service of the Takeda who has his <br/>
'castle' (a salt-store? there's no garrison) burnt down by <br/>
Tokugawa Ieyasu (I think) and is reduced to inn-keeping.<br/>
<br/>
Interesting because it refers to Will Adams, and that he and <br/>
Tokugawa Ieyasu spent many a pleasant afternoon talking <br/>
in the garden.<br/>
