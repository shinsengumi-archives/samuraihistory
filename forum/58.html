<div id="ygrps-yiv-1819455017">I live in Japan so all that I see is only in Japanese. I know that taiga<br/>
drama is shown in Hawaii and the west coast with english subtitles. Whether<br/>
they are available cassette I don't know. Most of the taiga dramas are<br/>
available in condensed form on video, available from NHK through a company<br/>
called Amuse Family Video <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.amuse-soft.co.jp/">http://www.amuse-soft.co.jp/</a> , but they're all in<br/>
Japanese. I tape a lot of jidai geki (running up to 200 titles) and would be<br/>
willing to make some form of trade. Please email me.<br/>

better job with the subtitles.  Otherwise, any self-respecting <br/>
japanese video store in america will have at least the most recent <br/>
taiga dramas available - although minus the subtitles.<br/>
