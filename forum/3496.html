<div id="ygrps-yiv-1671292920">Hey.<br/>
       If you're talking about novels, I'm guessing they're pretty accurate <br/>
but I really don't know, but I'd recommend Laura Joh Rowland's Sano Ichiro <br/>
mysteries.  I've read the first five of them (Shinju, Bundori, The Way of the <br/>
Traitor, The Concubine's Tattoo and The Samurai's Wife) and they're all great <br/>
books from a story perspective.  (Someone like Tony could verify their historicity <br/>
better than I.)<br/>
       They're set during the reign of shogun Tokugawa Tsunayoshi (Shinju set <br/>
in approximately 1689 through to 1691 as of Samurai's Wife).  About the <br/>
biggest deviation from history -- and the biggest delight from a fiction standpoint <br/>
-- is Sano's wife, Reiko, who is very much an ATYPICAL Japanese wife for the <br/>
time period, although their marriage is the traditional arranged one and <br/>
doesn't come until early in The Concubine's Tattoo.  The rest of the series is <br/>
Black Lotus, The Pillow Book of Lady Wisteria, The Dragon King's Palace and, <br/>
coming out I believe in March, is the so-far-titled ninth book, The Perfumed <br/>
Sleeve.  And yes, I plan to read them.  Rowland is of Japanese (I believe) and <br/>
Korean descent.<br/>
       Hope this helps!!!!!  8-D<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1919948163">I've read Shinju (Double Suicide) and enjoyed it very much.  Has <br/>
anyone read the Shike books?  They are by Robert Shea and cover a <br/>
period before and during the Mongol invasions.  I think he mixed up <br/>
many of the historical events in his books but it was well written.  <br/>
There are 2 books and they are both enjoyable but hard to find.  No <br/>
longer in print but you may be able to find a used copy.<br/>
<br/>
Nate, I picked up Taiko today.  It was the last hardcover copy they <br/>
had.  We'll see if I can finish it before the end of the year ;p<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Look for "The Signore" by Tsuji Kunio. It's a translation of his novel "Azuchi <br/>
okan ki" (a record of the trip to and from Azuchi), and purports to be a long <br/>
letter written by an Italian merchant/adventurer in the suite of Fr. Organtino. <br/>
It is available in paperback from Kodansha International.<br/>
<br/>
A fantastic read. Absolutely smashing.<br/>

won't be able to put it down. Just try not to read too<br/>
much at work--wouldn't want some jets going down<br/>
because you weren't paying attention!<br/>

Barnesandnoble.com, or Amazon.com...I'm sure you can<br/>
find what you're looking for. <br/>

copy. Got it from the library a few years ago. <br/>
<br/>
Also, Endo Shusaku's "The Samurai" is fairly good.<br/>
Interesting interplay with Christianity (of course,<br/>
Endo is Catholic). <br/>
