<h3>battle between swords and guns</h3>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1408611135">Group,<br/>
  I lived in Japan for 3 years and I took many Japanese history <br/>
classes.  I distinctly remember learning of a battle between samurai <br/>
using swords and samurai/soldiers using guns.  The point was clear <br/>
that the army using guns won the battle.  Does anyone know the name <br/>
of this battle?  I think it is the basis and thus loosely related to <br/>
the Last Samurai movie.<br/>

	Shame on you for not paying attention in class! A the battle of <br/>
Toba--Fushimi ,which happened by accident, the Shinsen-gumi lead the <br/>
Tokugawa forces. They fought a bitter argument to be first in line <br/>
cause they thought so highly of themselves. Carrying sword and spear <br/>
they the first to encounter the Satsuma-Choshu troops and the first to <br/>
be cut down. Their retreat prevented the western trained Tokugawa <br/>
troops behind them to organize properly thus the advantage was given to <br/>
the loyalist army with the first shots. After this I beleive it was <br/>
Hijikata who said "swords are useless, the age of the gun is here.." or <br/>
something to that effect.<br/>
	Surely though you are thinking of Tabaruzaka, 17 days of slaughter on <br/>
the outskirts of Kumamoto. In a small pass in the hills, covered by <br/>
thick bamboo grove, in the pouring rain (it rained for 15 days!) the <br/>
"samurai" army from Satsuma repeatedly attacked and repelled the <br/>
Government troops. Their guns were nearly useles in the constant <br/>
downpour, they couldn't maneuver as they had been trained and they had <br/>
no covering artillery.<br/>
	On the 16th day the farmers were replaced by Aizu samurai, who carried <br/>
a burning hatred for Satsuma, artillery was finally in place nearby on <br/>
a commanding hilltop and the rain stopped. It was all she wrote after <br/>
that...<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-991750666">I'm going to go see the movie today, but I cant remember the exact<br/>
name.  I think it was soemthing like the Saigo or Meji Rebellion,<br/>
since those were the two involoved. It was in 1877 when the new<br/>
imperial geovernment was taking the samurai's swords from them. A<br/>
bunch of samurai rebelled, but were defeated rather easily with the<br/>
imperial armies guns. <br/>
<br/>
One other one you might be thinking of happened earlier on, when the<br/>
country was being unified. The Hogen Rebellion, a samurai rebellion<br/>
against the imperial succession. <br/>
<br/>
Those are the two I remember with guns vs. swords. <br/>

I hope Tom Cruise dies at the end.</div>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-2132417056">It was the Satsuma Rebellion (aka the Last Samurai Rebellion).<br/>
<br/>
Contrary to the message below, the Samurai were not defeated easily.  The <br/>
Imperial forces outnumbered them approximately 4:1 and yet it took them about 7 <br/>
months to defeat the Samurai.  Casualties were approximately 10,000 for each <br/>
side.<br/>
<br/>
That means that even though the Samurai were outnumbered 4:1 that they <br/>
inflicted equal casualties.  If that constitutes being easily defeated than I hope I <br/>
never see a tough campaign.  :)<br/>

information is?  By any chance, is it in English?<br/>

Does the source provide an Order of Battle for either side?<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1579406764">Wow, some good history! Do you happen to have any information on the <br/>
first Choshu expedition? For example, the numbers on each sides, <br/>
what hans participated, any tactics, other important information... <br/>
<g><br/>
All the books ive looked at and websites ive read just keep <br/>
saying "and there was a first choshu expedition, which succeeded, <br/>
aww..., and then there was a second, which failed, yay..."<br/>
