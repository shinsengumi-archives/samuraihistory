<div id="ygrps-yiv-408544056">Hello,<br/>
 The use of Tattooing in the past in Japan was and still is to a degree not <br/>
the sort of thing that 'respectable' types use. By this I mean that in the <br/>
past the tatto was used as one method in the 'five tortures' to brand a <br/>
person who was convicted of a crime..The samurai themselves would not have <br/>
been tattooed unless they had been inprisoned or marked by the authorities in <br/>
this way..i.e. if he was Ronin it would be a possibility that he was tattooed <br/>
but otherwise it would be incredibly unlikely and if he was then it would <br/>
certainly be hidden from sight.<br/>
 Tattooing is still viewed along these same lines in Japan today..although <br/>
with the 'westernization' of Japans youth it is becoming more acceptable..The <br/>
Tattoo is often associated with the Yakuza clans and various 'disreputable' <br/>
types rather than the business classes and the same ideas were more in force <br/>
during the past in Japan.<br/>
 Hope this helps ya!<br/>
 Abayo.<br/>
