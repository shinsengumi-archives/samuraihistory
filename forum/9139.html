I do not agree with the answer Cepo gave you.  I lived in Japan with  <br/>
to different families of Samurai<br/>
ancestors.  I will reply to your question from what they told me and  <br/>
from an encyclopedia of Japan for English speakers I purchased in  <br/>

<br/>
Tragedy for samurai as the failure in fulfilling one great demand,<br/>
especially when it comes to serve his master, (which leads to the fact that<br/>
the samurai will be ashamed and chooses to perform seppuku.)<br/>
<br/>
Triumph would be to serve with great loyality his master.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-482263998">I did not say that it was wrong to ask, I have just said it is  <br/>
impossible to answer consistently.<br/>
<br/>
First of all one needs to define "samurai".<br/>
Do we mean by that term "Japanese warriors" ?<br/>
Of which rank?<br/>
In which region?<br/>
In which period? 1180? 1330? 1600?<br/>
Or we consider a samurai a hereditary member of a social class of the  <br/>
1700's who has never used a sword in his life?<br/>
One of the 47 Rônin? Toshiro Mifune...?<br/>
<br/>
Besides that, how are we to define what was important for the  <br/>
Japanese who have lived centuries ago?<br/>
I would have problems defining what "tragedy" and "triumph" are for  <br/>
kids living NOW in the suburbs of MY town...<br/>
Go figure that out!!<br/>
<br/>
Mind you, anyway: out of courtesy, I did answer...<br/>

 </span></blockquote>And all things considered, I still think that your answer <br/>
was the most correct for the whole spectrum of questions you <br/>
just raised above.<br/>
<br/>
For the samurai, like knights or soldiers or crusaders or <br/>
*anyone* who fights, winning is living, and losing is dying.<br/>
<br/>
Let's put all the Edo mumbo jumbo behind us.<br/>

  Hello.<br/>
<br/>
I do not agree with the answer Cepo gave you.  I lived in Japan with<br/>
to different families of Samurai<br/>
ancestors.  I will reply to your question from what they told me and<br/>
from an encyclopedia of Japan for English speakers I purchased in<br/>
Japan.  But, first I have to take care of a few household chores and<br/>
eat dinner.  What is her deadline for her homework?<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-2139307453">Can she chose one specific "samurai"?<br/>
That would make it much easier!<br/>
Japanese history is full of warriors who made it big, only to finish  <br/>
in disgrace.<br/>
If they have it in your library, Ivan Morris' book "The Nobility of  <br/>
Failure" could be a very handy text for this kind of presentation.<br/>
There are many short biographies, and with your help she should be ok.<br/>

I can't wait for you to finish with household chores, so that I can<br/>
read how the ancestors of the samurai you have lived with would help<br/>
to define "tragedy" and "triumph".<br/>

  Hello.<br/>
<br/>
I do not agree with the answer Cepo gave you.  I lived in Japan with<br/>
to different families of Samurai<br/>
ancestors.  I will reply to your question from what they told me and<br/>
from an encyclopedia of Japan for English speakers I purchased in<br/>
Japan.  But, first I have to take care of a few household chores and<br/>
eat dinner.  What is her deadline for her homework?<br/>
<br/>

At this point I imagine they own Himeji castle, and that had you to  <br/>
clean it all before you can get back to us... :o)<br/>
