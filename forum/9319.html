<div id="ygrps-yiv-685453432">hello, i'm a newcomer of this groups.<br/>
  first of all, i would like to say sorry since my mother language is not english, so that my english would be far from perfect.<br/>
   <br/>
  I know samurai archives webs from a novel written by Lian Hearn. It tells a story about Otori Clan. Was there really a clan called Otori? It also tells about people with extraordinary skills (such as duplicating himself, jump as high as 10 metres an so on) called the tribe. Is that true? or it's just the author's imagination?<br/>
   <br/>
  well, i guess that's all for this moment. thank you!<br/>

I've read a few of these books. They are pure fiction and are meant to be.  <br/>
The author wrote about "the Three Islands" rather than "Japan." I've found them <br/>
 enjoyable. But never, ever think that they were intended to history. The <br/>
series  is fantasy, fiction.<br/>
