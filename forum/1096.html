<h3>Why are people flaming Steven Turnbull?</h3>
by <i>ggouveia312000</i>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1307626956">I have not followed this discussion regarding Turnbull. Why are <br/>
people flamming Turnbull? I find his work is excellent and quite <br/>
usefull. My opinion is that his work is the best I have seen, I have <br/>
work from Bryant, Bottomley, Turnbull and some other author whose <br/>
name I forget. Turnbull's work to me out of this groups is the most <br/>
thorough.<br/>
<br/>
Why the flaming??????? I don't want rumour I want facts on Turnbull. <br/>
If someone is tarnishing a reputation based on rumor I do not want to <br/>
hear about it. If there is evidence then I will listen.</div>

<br/>
Those should start you off.<br/>
I'm sure there is probably more if not here then at the Samurai <br/>
History Forum.<br/>
<br/>
If I had the time and inclination (neither of which I currently have) <br/>
I could pinpoint various other innacuracies in Turnbull's works, <br/>
including a few where he contradicts himself on different pages of <br/>
the same book.  If you've read my previous posts, I hope you'll <br/>
gather that I have nothing against the guy personally, I just have <br/>
issues with his work, but don't take my word for it, grab some of his <br/>
books, and compare what he writes to the Japanese sources, as well as <br/>
Papinot.  In one of his books he has a picture of something <br/>
like "authors sketch of a calvalary charge" or something like that, <br/>
which is ACTUALLY A HAND-SKETCHED COPY of a picture from one of the <br/>
Rekishi Gunzo books! Of course he doesn't mention that fact in his <br/>
book, though.<br/>
<br/>
In essence, it is the contention of myself and apparently some others <br/>
on this forum that Turnbull is either a poor researcher or a lazy <br/>
researcher, or at the very least doesn't actually use any of the <br/>
Japanese sources he cites except in the most rudimentary way.  If you <br/>
have a copy of Turnbull's samurai warriors book and a copy of <br/>
Papinot's book, the fact that Turnbull took heavily from it is <br/>
painfully obvious even though he didn't cite it.  However he cites <br/>
many Japanese sources that contradict things he puts in his books.<br/>
I don't consider these posts 'flames' - I consider them legitimate <br/>
complaints against his scholarship.<br/>
<br/>
I still want to know what this guy's doctorate is actually IN!!!! <br/>
Like I said, if he is a doctor of journalism or economics, or <br/>
something unrelated to Japanese history, I'll recant everything I've <br/>
ever said about him. If he has a legitimate doctorate in Japanese <br/>
history, well.............<br/>

<br/>
To some extent I agree. Turnbull is one of the most<br/>
ACCESSIBLE authors in English, and let's face it, most<br/>
of us don't have the Japanese level to read about<br/>
Sengoku Jidai history in Japanese. According to the<br/>
Army, I speak fluent Japanese; ask me to translate<br/>
pages from Rekishi Gunzo, it takes me a day per page. <br/>
<br/>
Turnbull definitely is NOT the most academic of<br/>
authors. If you've read more than three of his books,<br/>
you've read the same information at least twice. Many<br/>
of his newer books are rehashes of the same<br/>
information, repackaged to sell more titles. I believe<br/>
that is much of what people are complaining about.<br/>
Some people also feel his information is "dumbed<br/>
down". My argument is that very few people want to<br/>
read about the effects of the change from the koku<br/>
taxation system to the koban taxation system on some<br/>
obscure village in Shikoku. However, most of the<br/>
"academic" authors focus on inane things like this. My<br/>
interest is military and political history, and aside<br/>
from the "classics" like Sansom, Berry, and other<br/>
mentioned, Turnbull is one of the few out there that<br/>
is readable without a degree in Greek. <br/>
<br/>
Bottomley & Hopson are EXCELLENT when it comes to<br/>
Armour and weapons development. AJ Bryant is excellent<br/>
too. <br/>
<br/>
For those who complain about Turnbull's (lack of)<br/>
scholarship: Have you read any nof his newer books?<br/>
Either the Kakure-kirishtan or the one on the Korean<br/>
invasions? I have not yet (I want the Korean invasion<br/>
book) but I believe they are probably based a little<br/>
more on original research than his older books. Again,<br/>
rewrites to get more copies sold, I believe. <br/>
<br/>
That doesn't mean his writing is worthless or bad. All<br/>
it means is TONY, YOU NEED TO PUBLISH MORE, to give us<br/>
something else! (Tony, you know I love you!)<br/>
<br/>
Nate Ledbetter<br/>
<br/>
I AGREE COMPLETELY: if you read Samurai Warriors,<br/>
Samurai Warlords, Battles of the Samurai, Samurai<br/>
Warfare....they all read essentially the same, even<br/>
down to the anecdotes! <br/>

 </span></blockquote>Upon further examination you are correct. The English sources are <br/>
quite scarce and there is little competition. As I recall many of <br/>
what he writes is rehashed from his other books.</div>

Bottomley & Hopson are EXCELLENT when it comes to<br/>

too. <br/>

<br/>
--> Nate, without double checking sources and dates, the Korean Invasion<br/>
book is in my opinion an excellant read, and worth every penny spent.<br/>
<br/>

---> Nate, I also agree with this, and Tony, as part of a publishing<br/>
business, if you have any interest in getting back into print in a small way<br/>
drop me a note offline and we can discuss more.<br/>
<br/>
And sorry everyone else for a blanant plug here, and taking advantage of an<br/>
opportunity, buts its Nates fault, he lead me on <grin><br/>
