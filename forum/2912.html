<br/>
 </span></blockquote>The first Choshu expedition does not seem to have been a particularly military affair. The whole bakumatsu era seems to have been particularly confusing. The bakufu was weakened by questions of succession, the han were split between 'conservatives' and 'loyalists',rich peasants and farmers were demanding 'yonaoshi, there were bizarre outbreaks of popular emotion like 'ee ja nai ka.' Also no telegraph etc so information took a long time to be transmitted. People changed their names frequently too!<br/>
<br/>
Choshu loyalists and extremists wanted to reestablish their influence over the court which they had lost to Satsuma. The shotai under Kijima, Kusaka and others tried to attack the Kin Mon and were repulsed by a mixture of Satsuma and Aizu troops in alliance with the bakufu at that time. Many daimyo and han sympathised with Choshu who were seen as obedient to the Emperor in resisting foreigners. Also a defeat by the bakufu of Choshu might turn out badly for the other powerful han, especially Satsuma. At the same time Choshu was about to be attacked at Shimonoseki by the Four Countries (US, England, France and Holland) for attacking foreign ships. Choshu was completely defeated in this encounter but some strange rapport sprang up between defeated and conqueror, and relations between England and the  Choshu loyalists became quite warm. This led to the supply of Western arms through Sakamoto and Thomas Glover.<br/>
<br/>
The bakufu made threatening noises to the Choshu daimyo, Mori Takachika  (I think), who is generally considered to be a weak personalitiy (known as the sansei daimyo as when he woke during meetings he always said 'sansei!' I agree.) and the heir, Motonori, who were both placed under 'best behaviour' orders. The Elders concerned were forced to take their own lives and their heads were delivered to the shogun. Four staff officers were also executed. Kijima, Kusaka and several other shotai leaders died in the fighting.<br/>
<br/>
Sufu Masonosuke, the loyalist bureaucratic who was responsible for the first Kyoto movements by Choshu committed suicide at around this time, possible because of the attempted assassination of Inoue Kaoru, to whom he was very close. Inoue did not seem likely to survive and the loyalist policy was in complete tatters. <br/>
<br/>
However, Takasugi Shinsaku was fortuitiously in prison at the time and therefore escaped death or punishment. Inoue survived. Ito and Arigata were not invovled and these were the shotai leaders who came to the fore in 1867/8. Saigo Takamori of Satsuma was one of those who eventually advised against too harsh a punishment of Shohu in 1864, said to be the first sign of rapprochment between the two han - always considered as tiger and dragon till now.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>There's an interesting preface to the 2000 edition to Choshu in the Meiji Restoration, giving some of the ideas Craig would either change or elaborate if he were writing now. It's too long to precis here. He also gives several books written since, which you probably already know: Ones I haven't read but would like to get hold of are Kelly: Deference and Defiance in 19th c Japan 1985. Koschmann; The Mito Ideology 1987. Baxter The Meiji Unification through the lens of Ishikawa Prefecture 1994. Shiba Goro Remembering Aizu. 1999<br/>
<br/>
Mito in the Meiji Restoration - that would be the most enthralling, I reckon. Maybe some Phd student is working on it in Mito right now...<br/>
<br/>
The MR is like a jigsaw puzzle, so many bits to fit in and so much happening. Craig says, 'it was in fact the great cultural and institutional divide between the old Japan and the new.'<br/>
