(PRWEB) June 24, 2005 -- Ian Edwards, Pagan Chaplain for Kingston <br/>
and Ford Prisons, will be taking part in the International Festival <br/>
of the Sea at the end of this month. A qualified and experienced <br/>
hypnotherapist, reflexologist, masseur and counsellor, he will be <br/>
using these skills in the role of the character of "Ambrose <br/>
Pemberthy - Master Mesmerist".<br/>
<br/>
Ian has trained in the martial art of Ninjutsu since 1985 and <br/>
achieved his third degree black belt in the Bujinkan style when he <br/>
lived in Japan from 1989 to 1990. He still trains at the Shinobikai <br/>
club run by Mark Lutman on Tuesdays at the Shinboku Keep Fit and <br/>
Martial Arts Centre, in St Mary"s road, Portsmouth.<br/>
<br/>
"In the role of Ambrose Pemberthy I can bring together several of my <br/>
skills in a unique manner" Said Ian. "The late Seventeenth and early <br/>
Eighteenth centuries were a time of tremendous expansion and trade <br/>
for the British Empire. My character joined a ship of the East India <br/>
Company as a surgeons mate because of his family background in the <br/>
apothecary trade. Already skilled in Witchcraft from contacts in the <br/>
New Forest, and Ritual Magic from a family friend, he was exposed to <br/>
Indian and Asian magic and learned Mesmerism from a Dutch Barber-<br/>
Surgeon. <br/>
<br/>
Marooned in Japan when the official line of the Tokugawa Shogunate <br/>
was "All foreigners to be killed on sight" except for those in two <br/>
tiny trading posts. Ambrose was sheltered by local Ninja because of <br/>
his unique knowledge of the outside world. He shared his skills with <br/>
the Ninja and learned their skills of combat, bushcraft, and magic. <br/>
On returning home he uses his skills for healing others, and to help <br/>
the intelligence service of the day."<br/>
<br/>
"During the time I was living and training in Japan I visited many <br/>
of the areas where Ninjutsu was practiced. There are museums devoted <br/>
to the history of the art, and restored special farmhouses - <br/>
called "Ninja Dera" - with hidden doors, alarm floors, and concealed <br/>
protective devices. But just visiting the environment gave me a <br/>
great insight into the roots and history of the Martial Art I <br/>
practice."<br/>
<br/>
Ian has been a practitioner of Paganism and magic since 1979 and is <br/>
officially recognised in his capacity as Pagan Chaplain to Ford and <br/>
Kingston Prison by the Home Office.<br/>
<br/>
Ian Edwards will be part of the Anchor Lane site in the Dockyard <br/>
throughout IFOS<br/>
