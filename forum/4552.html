"Does your interest in modern naval affairs mean that you will focus on <br/>

<br/>
No! i am fully absorbed in my latest favorite subject and intend to learn<br/>
as much as I can. Of course any naval stuff I run accross is an added bonus.<br/>
<br/>
Right now I am reading "Samurai a Military History" by Stephen Turnbull. I<br/>
heard it is a good place to start.<br/>

I hear you! This is just one of the things that makes researching Japanese<br/>
history sometimes difficult. Original source material, unless you can read<br/>
Japanese. Even then it depends on when it was written. For example, I have<br/>
managed to get my hands on a set of the Official Japanese Naval General<br/>
Staff Report written after the Russo-Japanese War! What a score.<br/>
<br/>
Problem is, it is written in Meji era Japanese and even my Japanese friends<br/>
and associates have a very hard time translating it. But! And this is a big<br/>
but! I have since found a copy that was published in Germany in 1912-1914.<br/>
Lucky for me the set was published before the start of WWI. The field staff<br/>
report was never finished being translated due to the war. My parents were<br/>
from Germany an d we soke and read German as children do it was not hard<br/>
for me to get back into reading it. All it took was a chart of the Fraktur<br/>
alphabet and I was off to the races.<br/>
<br/>
I will list the books that I have managed to collect covering the samurai<br/>
and Japanese early history in another email.<br/>
<br/>

Just found this group and decided to join. While I am a big Japanese <br/>

Hi Bill<br/>
<br/>
I mainly lurk here, but yes I collect and game with miniatures, and have<br/>
"around" 1000 25/28mm Samurai miniatures.<br/>
<br/>
Like most wargamers, only a small percentage of these are painted!<br/>
<br/>
I play Warhammer Ancient Battles but my job title might give a clue as to<br/>
why that is !!<br/>
<br/>
There are a number of other rule sets out there, some specialising in<br/>
Samurai warfare, I have them, but never tried them.<br/>
<br/>
Theres another yahoo group called gekokujo which tends to focus more on the<br/>
gaming aspects of samurai warfare, and so if wargaming is an interest, you<br/>
may find that group useful.<br/>
<br/>
If you have any particular questions on the gaming side you can ask always<br/>
drop me a note off line, or here.<br/>
<br/>
Kind regards<br/>

that. Any chance of getting even just a fraction of it scanned?<br/>

<blockquote><span title="ireply"> >Problem is, it is written in Meji era Japanese and even my Japanese friends<br/>

read for hundreds of years.The often cited example being Italian. <br/>
Apparently Dante's Inferno is almost no problem at all to read for <br/>
modern Italian speakers (of which I am not one). On the other hand <br/>
Japanese has changed very significantly over the same period of <br/>
time.<br/>
<br/>
I'm not sure that Meiji Japanese should be _that_ big of a deal - <br/>
but maybe it's the combination of the fact that it is Military <br/>
language and the fact that it was written 100 years ago that makes <br/>
it difficult.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> >I will list the books that I have managed to collect covering the samurai<br/>

When you say "early history" - how early do you mean? My own personal <br/>
realm of interest is currently roughly the 16th century, though I am <br/>
being pulled ever further backwards. I've recently started to get <br/>
interested in the Ritsuryo system which had its start in the 7th <br/>
century.<br/>

	Welcome, I have visited your site and enjoyed it much that first time <br/>
as I do now. Many of us here have an interest in the Bakumatsu period <br/>
and the turbulent times Japan experienced as the world of the samurai <br/>
passed into history. looking forward to your contributions.<br/>

"What a score indeed! I'd love to see even just a page or two of <br/>

<br/>
I will give it a try, my scanner at home is not set up so that I can safely<br/>
scan the books without taking a chance of damageing them, they are pretty<br/>
fragile, but I will try it at work where we have large flat bed scanners.<br/>

read for hundreds of years.The often cited example being Italian. <br/>
Apparently Dante's Inferno is almost no problem at all to read for <br/>
modern Italian speakers (of which I am not one). On the other hand <br/>
Japanese has changed very significantly over the same period of <br/>
time.<br/>
<br/>
I'm not sure that Meiji Japanese should be _that_ big of a deal - <br/>
but maybe it's the combination of the fact that it is Military <br/>
language and the fact that it was written 100 years ago that makes <br/>
it difficult.<br/>

otherwise. But of course I'd love to share notes.<br/>

When you say "early history" - how early do you mean? My own personal <br/>
realm of interest is currently roughly the 16th century, though I am <br/>
being pulled ever further backwards. I've recently started to get <br/>
interested in the Ritsuryo system which had its start in the 7th <br/>
century.<br/>
