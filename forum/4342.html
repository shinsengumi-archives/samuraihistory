 You could also try www.token.com under the UK sword register section where<br/>
a number of swords and makers are described and illustrated with oshigata.<br/>

	A very good book for introduction to the Japanese sword, it's history, <br/>
and some famous smiths is "The Japanese Sword" by Sato Kanzan (trans. <br/>
Joe Earle) from Kodansha. Afu Research has translated Fujishiros' <br/>
Dictionary of swordsmiths", a specialists book really and not cheap but <br/>
there are many good stories therein. Of course the very best books <br/>
relating "tales of swordsmiths" are by Fukunaga Suiken and are to date <br/>
unfortunately only in Japanese.<br/>
