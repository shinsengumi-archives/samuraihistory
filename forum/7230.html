<h3>Kokushi / Provincial Governor</h3>
by <i>angushaynes</i>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1791970779">Can anyone shed some light on this role? From what I understand, kokushi<br/>
was an Imperial Court post prior to the Kamakura bakufu that provided<br/>
the same role as the bakufu's shugo (with shugo actually being brought<br/>
about by the Kamakura bakufu to replace the kokushi). Is this correct?<br/>
Generally, did the kokushi actually stay in the lands they were<br/>
responsible for, or were they like Governors and resided in the capital?<br/>
<br/>
Thanks,<br/>
Angus<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1956242413">Papinot indicates that prior to the 12th c., the Kokushi lived in the<br/>
provinces they governed, and their terms at times varied depending on<br/>
the distance from the capital. After the 12th c., they remained in<br/>
Kyoto and were represented by a Mokudai. By the 14th c., the title was<br/>
reserved to the kuge (nobles) and passed out of use.<br/>
