<h3>Uesugi Kenshin and Sengoku Jidai life for the non-samurai</h3>
by <i>nez_uk1981</i>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-807495041">I'm looking to write a novel featuring real historical figures as <br/>
back ground characters. The main characters and plot will be fiction <br/>
perhaps based loosely on real events.<br/>
I was reading some interesting stuff about Uesugi Kenshin and was <br/>
wondering if anyone can help me find out more information about him. <br/>
The Samurai-Archives have provided me with a decent basic knowledge <br/>
but I'd like to get to know a little more about him, where he lived, <br/>
how he lived, his family history, what his people thought of him, <br/>
rumours about him (like the one about him really being a woman), <br/>
basically anything you've got on the guy would be really helpful.<br/>
<br/>
I'd also be very grateful if anyone can shed more light on the life <br/>
of the common man during the Sengoku Jidai. How did a typical village <br/>
look, what kind of industries were prevelant, what did an average <br/>
home look like? (particularly keen to <br/>
find out information about what life in the mountainous areas of <br/>
Japan was like).<br/>
<br/>
I've collected thousands of pages of information on the history of <br/>
Japan so far but I'm looking for information from people who have a <br/>
true passion for this particular era. I'm hoping you can perhaps <br/>
introduce me to some interesting characters and stories which I might <br/>
not have picked up before.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks,<br/>
<br/>
Nez.</div>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-523332140">Here's some random things I've translated from Japanese sources and <br/>
had lying around (mostly direct translations and therefore maybe a <br/>
bit clunky):<br/>
<br/>
Kenshin was valorous with a chivalrous spirit who prized justice <br/>
and order. His speach and actions were always passionate and direct <br/>
(to the point).<br/>
<br/>
His personality is reflected in his military operations (movements), <br/>
which were 'colored' by his chivalry. He would help the weak and <br/>
crush the strong.<br/>
<br/>
"It is recorded in the "Meishougenkouroku" that Kenshin admired <br/>
Minamoto Yoshitsune.<br/>
<br/>
Kenshin's genius for battle command came from ardent adoration of <br/>
Minamoto Yoshitsune as well as his own battle experience.<br/>
<br/>
"The Dragon of Echigo", Kenshin, was the second son of the Echigo <br/>
Shugo Nagao Tamekage. The Nagao clan was one of the "eight clans of <br/>
the Kantou" (Bandou Hachiheishi) which were descended from Emperor <br/>
Kammu.<br/>
<br/>
While Shingen was alive, he said "Kenshin is an honorable and just <br/>
man. He has no equal in the realm." In 1573, when Shingen died of <br/>
illness on campaign, his final message to Katsuyori was "If you ask <br/>
Kenshin for assistance, he will not refuse. He will definately <br/>
assist you." Shingen recognized that Kenshin was an honorable man <br/>
with a strong sense of duty and justice.<br/>
<br/>
Kenshin heard of Shingen's death while eating a meal at Kasugayama. <br/>
He threw his chopsticks without thinking, saying "He was my rival for <br/>
many years, but the great general who was a pillar of the Kantou <br/>
warrior families has been lost. It is truly a shame." It is <br/>
recorded that he wept at the news.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-429433030">If you can read Japanese I would recommend one of the latest in the Rekishi<br/>
Gunzo Series called Sengoku Bushinden. It had a lot on daily life as well as<br/>
bios of many overlooked samurai. Also you might try Shinjin Butsu series of<br/>
bios for Kenshin. These books give a good breakdown of the basic facts of<br/>
the peoples lives. If you can't read Japanese, well there really aint much.<br/>
maybe try Daily life in Japan by Louis Frederic but its quite rare to find.</div>

  As far as house layout and common village life goes I suggest that you <br/>
read this book:<br/>
<br/>
"Everyday Things in Premodern Japan: The Hidden Legacy of Material Culture" <br/>
and it is by Susan B. Hanley  ISBN:  0520218124<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
  Best of luck in your writing.<br/>

Peace,<br/>
