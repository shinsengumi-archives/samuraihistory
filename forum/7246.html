<div id="ygrps-yiv-1061348126">- firstly i would like to say hi to everyone as a returning member absent <br/>
since 2003. good to be back online and well informed<br/>
<br/>
-i am taking a trip to japan in september, OSAKA TOKYO HIROSHIMA AND <br/>
TAKAMATSU. I was wondering if anyone had anyidea if there was anything of <br/>
interest n these area's for a japanese history buff that is NOT to be found <br/>
in the usual tourist guides and history books. if anyone is familiar with <br/>
these area's it would be great if you could pass on any info, or words of <br/>
wisdom.<br/>
<br/>
- third and finally (this is a bit of a weird one). i have a large interest <br/>
in the unification of japan, ieyasu and co. i recently heard that written <br/>
music originated in china about 600BC. i am well educated in music(grade 8 <br/>
theory) and am looking for information on medieval japanese munuscripts. i'm <br/>
after books and websites with examples of the style they used to record <br/>
music. i am totally ignorant,as western music is taught with only the <br/>
western history. would be great if i could get hold of some medieval <br/>
japanese music in western manuscript, in order to get my tiny brain round <br/>
it. honestly, any information at all would be well appreciated.<br/>
