 </span></blockquote>well, we need help with the sword info and the technique of their fighting. And we know practically nothing about Bushi-do. While we do know that not all samurai followed it, we don't really know exactly what it was. That's just one thing.<br/>

<br/>
Hi, I'm new here myself, but I have an idea of how to answer you.<br/>
<br/>
There is a wealth of technical and historical information about the<br/>
construction and evolution of the Japanese sword. This subject alone<br/>
could fill years of your time.<br/>
I'd suggest visiting: <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://home.earthlink.net/~steinrl/nihonto.htm">http://home.earthlink.net/~steinrl/nihonto.htm</a><br/>
and  reading for a while so that you an narrow down the specifics of<br/>
your question.<br/>
<br/>
With regard to the various techniques of armed and unarmed combat,<br/>
again there is a vast plethora of historical and modern information<br/>
about the subject. I've trained in Martial Arts for 21 years and I'm<br/>
still learning.<br/>
What specific arena of combat are you interested in and what era?<br/>
Battlefields, duels, martial arts, koryu or gendai ryu etc...<br/>
<br/>
As for Bushido, this is a Code of Conduct which was never really<br/>
adopted by the Samurai, it occupies much the same place in myth as the<br/>
Hagakure.<br/>
Most Samurai were followed Shinto or Buddhism, the early Samurai<br/>
followed a fairly esoteric form of buddhism known a Mikyo Buddhism,<br/>
which is akin in a few respects to Bushido.<br/>
<br/>
I am aware that there are a lot of people in here with far greater<br/>
knowledge of Japanese history and culture than I possess, so please<br/>
correct any of the above if I am incorrect.<br/>
<br/>
If you're looking for a fairly easy insight into Japanese culture as<br/>
is popularly percieved, then look for films by the director Akira<br/>
Kurosawa, especially, Ran, Kagemusha, Yojimbo, Sanjuro and of course<br/>
Seven Samurai.<br/>
<br/>
Best wishes..</div>
