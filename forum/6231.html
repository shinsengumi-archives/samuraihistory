<h3>On naming swords</h3>
by <i>thomas_tessera</i>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-459015037">There is an excerpt from 'My Father' by Arai Hasuseki, in Legends of<br/>
the Samurai' and it relates a story:<br/>
<br/>
Hasuseki's father Masanori, lived from 1601-82,  'not far removed<br/>
from the Sengoku Jidai', as his son describes it.<br/>
<br/>
'You should never say ... that you carry a sharp blade ... someone<br/>
heard someone else say his sword cuts exceptionally well, so said <br/>
"By Heaven, you act rudely as if no-one else was around you. <br/>
Do you suppose anyone would carry a sword that does not cut? <br/>
Come on, man, see for yourself whether my sword cuts or not!" <br/>
and drew his sword.'<br/>
<br/>
Apparently, bystanders intervened before blood was spilt.<br/>
<br/>
It would appear from other details related to named swords, here and<br/>
elsewhere, that names usually derived from an incident to do with<br/>
the sword, rather than from any inherent quality of the blade. <br/>
<br/>
The risk in attributing qualities to the sword itself implies that<br/>
other swords lack that quality, or rather this sword is superior <br/>
in that quality to all others, and thus an insult to the owner, <br/>
and an invitation to a duel.<br/>
<br/>
They were touchy chaps, in those days.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-14544615">Sad to say I don't have a sword.<br/>
<br/>
In my iai days an iaito from Japan was the most I could afford.<br/>
<br/>
We purchased our iaito or shinken via British sensei making trips <br/>
to Japan. Another route for shinken was from visiting sensei with <br/>
a shinken for sale.<br/>
<br/>
I never gave my iaito a name, but if I did it would be 'the whistler' <br/>
or something close. When it arrived we had an informal dojo <br/>
unwrapping, admiration of iaito blade and fittings, etc - and then <br/>
everyone had to have a go, at which point it was generally agreed <br/>
it made a most pleasing whistle as it sang through the air.<br/>
<br/>
We then had a 'whistling shiai' which involved everyone trying to <br/>
outwhistle my iaito, which even involved me using sensei's shinken <br/>
to see if I could outwhistle my iaito - but no joy.<br/>

Sure, but I think the point of the tale is that you shouldn't brag about it:<br/>
someone is likely to want to call you on it.  No argument that some swords<br/>
are better than others, now or then.  It's curious how many people with<br/>
expensive swords, however, seem to be of the opinion that the quality of the<br/>
steel decides the fight, rather than the quality of the combatants' skills.<br/>
Unbeatable steel does not make an unbeatable fighter.  Only when there is a<br/>
tremendous disparity between the two blades does that become a significant<br/>
factor.  So the incident as related, I think, can be better understood in<br/>
the context of these social and martial attitudes than in the context of<br/>
comparative blade quality.<br/>
Thomas, I browse through that book, but I've not read that excerpt before.<br/>
Many thinks.  (Hmm.  That was meant to be 'thanks', but both are accurate<br/>
enough, so I'll leave the typo.)<br/>

I've seen the "1 sword worth X overcome by 100 spears<br/>
worth a whole lot less X" quote attributed to both<br/>
Asakura Yoshikage and one of the Hojo lords. Both were<br/>
fairly pragmatic about things. <br/>
