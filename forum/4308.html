<h3>Masazumi</h3>
by <i>ramalseepish</i>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1086848042">Hello everyone, and good day to all.<br/>
 <br/>
My name, is of course, Ramal. I have Japanese ancestry through my father's family. His great grand-father, Hiroki Masazumi immigrated to Canada, to apparently, avoid a marriage to a woman whom he did not love.<br/>
 <br/>
He settled in north-western NorthWest Territories (very very large territory) and started a family there, in the town of Fort Good Hope.<br/>
 <br/>
I was not aware of my Japanese ancestry, but it made a-lot of sense to me as I've always carried a strong interest in the Japanese culture, more specifically, the Samurai.<br/>
 <br/>
I was hoping I can be directed to a source that could possibly shed some light on the Masazumi family name. I've tried web searching at a couple search engines, but didn't find anything I don't already know, which isn't much.<br/>
 <br/>
Any and all help will be appreciated.<br/>
 <br/>
Regards.....Ramal<br/>
 <br/>
 <br/>

<h3>Check it out -- rare J. armour book on e-bay</h3>
by <i>sengokudaimyo</i>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-752349975">If you have the spondoolicks to spend and an interest in REALLY early Japanese <br/>
armour, e-bay has something for you.<br/>
<br/>
A rare -- VERY VERY VERY RARE -- book called "Nihon Jôdai no Katchû" (Japan's <br/>
Ancient Armour), written by the noble and godlike historian and armour <br/>
researcher Suenaga dai-sensei, is up for sale.<br/>
<br/>
I have a copy -- one of the two or three in the US, I think. (Mine was once the <br/>
property of the Imperial Naval Academy Library, but that was in another world).<br/>
<br/>
The book details all the armour bits excavated from kofun up to 1944, when the <br/>
book was published. Moreover, the book is full of photos of the full-sized <br/>
reproductions of the armour made by Suenaga.<br/>
<br/>
Most of the print run, as I understand it, was bombed out of existence, so this <br/>
is a goldmine to find one here. If you're interested in pre-800 armour, you MUST <br/>
have this book.<br/>
<br/>
It is E-bay auction item 3909701273. Check it out.<br/>
