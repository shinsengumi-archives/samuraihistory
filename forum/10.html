<br/>
There was a song of a pack-horse driver saying, <br/>
"Difficult against one's wishes to cross the Ooi River, <br/>
while possible to go over the Hakone mountains on horseback."<br/>
   <br/>
"Hakone hachiri wa uma demo kosu ga,<br/>
Kosu ni kosarenu Ooi-gawa."<br/>
  <br/>
In the Edo period, it was permitted to travel rather freely around the country except passing through the <br/>
checkpoint of Hakone and crossing the Ooi River.<br/>
 <br/>
In those days, "Iri-teppou" and "De-onna" were especially marked by the Edo shogunate. "Iri-teppo" (In-guns?) <br/>
are guns which were brought into Edo from the western countries such as Satsuma-han or Choushu-han. "De-<br/>
onna" (Out-women ?) are such women as the ladies of daimyo or their maidservants who went out of Edo to <br/>
the western countries hidding confidentials away. The ladied of daimyo were compelled to stay in Edo as a kind <br/>
of hostages. The Edo shogunate was very nervous of the tendency of the western counries and paid close <br/>
attention to taking guns for rebelling against it into Edo and to leaking out secret information of the shogunate <br/>
through forge women travellers of the western daimyo.<br/>
  <br/>
The Ooi River waited for those travellers who successfully passed through the checkpoint of Hakone.<br/>
<br/>
The shogunate intentionally didn't construct any bridge across the Ooi River in order to prevent the western <br/>
armies from advancing into Edo. The melting snow on the Mt. Fuji or heavy rains sometimes caused a sudden <br/>
rise in the River. At that time, travellers inevitably put up at inns in Mishima (in Shizuoka prefecture at present) <br/>
along the River.<br/>
<br/>
In those days, as a post town, very prosperous was Mishima where there were many "geisha" who came from <br/>
Edo or other districts."<br/>
