<h3>SWORD</h3>
by <i>g3mneye</i>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1618830700">Hi there everyone:<br/>
<br/>
This is a technical question about the shape of Samurai swords. I've <br/>
noticed that the earliest swords were straight but later ones up to <br/>
preMeijei period were curved. Someone once told me (now I'm not gonna' <br/>
say who in case they're wrong) that the tachi were curved due to the <br/>
folding and cooling process. So actually the curving was supposed to a <br/>
fluke or something, that's what I was told, it's not what I'm saying.<br/>
<br/>
What do you guys think. Can anybody verify this or is it just bunk?<br/>
<br/>
Thanks,<br/>

	A skilled smith ultimately has control over all aspects of <br/>

produces curvature in the Japanese sword. Actually it is the cooling <br/>
that does it, when the sword is heated in the fire the clay keeps the <br/>
back of the sword relatively cool so it doesn't expand as much as the <br/>
unprotected edge steel. The edge steel expands, the back does not and <br/>
this produces curve, the sword is then "flash frozen" in this state <br/>

(before yakiire) depending on the shape he wants (more or less sori) <br/>
in the finished piece. He can adjust the curve in other ways after <br/>
yakiire as well.<br/>

<br/>
I'd just like to add to Tom's explanation, that friends of mine who are<br/>
or have been professional swordsmiths making straight European blades<br/>
here in England, tell me that trying to stop one from bending is the<br/>
hard thing. Any imperfections in forging a symmetrical blade, tends to<br/>
cause it to bend. A problem that has to be then corrected. I am told<br/>
that some of my swords have come from the hardening and tempering<br/>
process looking like cork-screws! The real art is then learning to make<br/>
this effect work "for" you rather than against. And I think we can all<br/>
agree that the Japanese smiths really know how to make it work "for".<br/>

<br/>
I'm afraid I don't subscribe to the happy accident - <br/>
try selling a 'bent' sword to a client who's commissioned it! <br/>
Also the shape of the blade determines its dynamic - so this <br/>
would require someone stumbling upon the curved blade by accident, <br/>
and then working out the technique of its usage?<br/>
<br/>
However, if warriors (and smiths) had experienced the superiority <br/>
of the curved blade over the straight, then the benefits would have <br/>
been self-evident.<br/>
<br/>
According to a quick look round online, the Japanese came into<br/>
contact with curved blades via Korea as well as the native Emishi - <br/>
certainly as I understand it they learnt advanced forging techniques <br/>
from the Koreans.<br/>

Not sure that I subscribe to the "happy accident" theory as there were<br/>
definte efforts to produce sori from early (pre Heian jidai) days. It seems<br/>
that as sori was first introduced in the nakago area(where there is no clay)<br/>
this must have been intentional. Of course I agree with you that a skilled<br/>
swordsmith has control over all aspects of sword making being able to<br/>
control and dictate the kind of sori at will (saki-soroi, koshisori etc.)<br/>
As to Rod's original question, only very early swords were straight (Nara<br/>
period and earlier) and mostly these were not thought to be of Japanese<br/>
manufacture but imported from the Asian mainland along with the technology.<br/>
The true Japanese sword as we would recognise it today, was perfected in the<br/>
Heian period and is still made today, well after Meiji. Also both tachi and<br/>
katana are made basically the same way, although the shape of tachi tend to<br/>
be more slender and graceful than most katana (gross generalisation and<br/>
oversimplification!)<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1073090759">Clive et al-<br/>
	Rod asked if the "Happy accident" idea was complete hooey. I <br/>
might have said "not completely" and left it at that. As we know from <br/>
Ogasawara Sensei and the fine exhibition at the Sanno Museum; the <br/>
shape and construction of the early Japanese warabite-to combined <br/>
with continental swordmaking techniques to give us the Wan-to <br/>
(Japanese sword).<br/>
	Part of that process was combining different steels and <br/>
learning to control the curvature in a blade sometimes over thirty <br/>
inches in length. The explanation for the presence of uchisori <br/>
(reverse curve at the tip) on tanto, as given to me, is that the <br/>
smiths, understanding that the blade would curve on yaki-ire, made <br/>
their blades with reverse curve. A little too much and the blade <br/>
would still have a hint of that reverse curve when finished, done <br/>
just right the sori produced when the blade was heated and cooled <br/>
produced a perfectly straight blade. As time went on tanto too took <br/>
on more curvature.<br/>
	Now how much of this was experimentation and how much was <br/>
application of knowledge learned in the field, I don't think we can <br/>
say though later changes in shape show just how quickly popular <br/>
styles of construction spread.Favoring the idea that it was work by <br/>
design. In fact in my original post I didn't say just where or when <br/>
that "happy accident" might have happened. I am more inclined to <br/>
believe that it was a Chinese smith who first put a hard edge into a <br/>
soft bodied sword and produce curve in the process. The Japanese <br/>
either learned it from their neighbors, in which case it was likely <br/>
well understood by the time it got to Japan, or they had to "relearn <br/>
it" for themselves, getting that curve to "work for them" as Dean <br/>
said...<br/>

<h3>Re SWORD (effectiveness)</h3>

<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-2064313228">Hi Patrick -<br/>
<br/>
You say:<br/>
"the samurai sword was curved because when you strike it against<br/>
something, the blows dont hurt as much."<br/>
<br/>
Then what would be the point of that?<br/>
<br/>
"try it some time, take a tai chi sword and strike it against<br/>
something as hard as you can, then take a samurai sword and strike <br/>
it against something as hard as you can and you can tell the <br/>
difference of the vibrations that the blade make on your hand."<br/>
<br/>
Strength undoubtedly plays a part (as my Tameshigiri instructor<br/>
laughingly told us weak-wristed iaidoka) but technique plays a <br/>
far more important part.<br/>
<br/>
A curved blade cuts far more effectively than a straight one, and in<br/>
many (if not most) techniques in Japanese swordsmanship, if one <br/>
traces an arc following the tip of the blade, the cut is exectuted on <br/>
the return - the outward arc is from start point to target, the<br/>
return is the cut and withdraw.<br/>
<br/>
In multiple combat or a meleé, this ensures the weapon is always<br/>
'free' of the target after the cut, and does not require the<br/>
swordsman to disentangle his blade from its victim.<br/>
<br/>
All of which can be done is a single cutting stroke, as opposed to a<br/>
straightr blade, which does not lend itself to cutting and which<br/>
breaks down into a series of separate actions.<br/>
<br/>
A horizontal thrust, delivered with a curved blade, creates a<br/>
devastating wound, compared to a straight blade.<br/>
<br/>
In fact, I think in every aspect a curved blade outperforms a<br/>
straight one ... if the reverse was the case, then the samurai would <br/>
have favoured straight over curved.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1619106992">Dear Group:<br/>
Hi, I am not an expert on sword except for the fact<br/>
that I was trained in one of 24 style techniques(sword<br/>
technique) from Chosun dynasty when I was in the<br/>
middle school.<br/>
<br/>
I only had a chance to read messages on an informal<br/>
Korean Martial Arts website with regard to this issue<br/>
a few years ago.<br/>
(<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://cafe.chosun.com/clubmain.do?p_club_id=muye)">http://cafe.chosun.com/clubmain.do?p_club_id=muye)</a><br/>
<br/>
There, I found the following:<br/>
1) Curved blades were originally adopted by a<br/>
Mongolian Army of Chengiskan because of its<br/>
superiority over the straight blade in the the<br/>
multiple melee in the battlefields.<br/>
<br/>
2) After the Mongol conquest of China and Korea, the<br/>
curved blade was naturally introduced to the North<br/>
East Asia.<br/>
Its benefits were soon recognized in this region.<br/>
<br/>
3) The technique of producing the curved blade is<br/>
generally more complex than that of the straight<br/>
blade. So, it was not produced until that time.(I do<br/>
not know the sepecific period)<br/>
<br/>
4) It may be conceivable that the use of curved blades<br/>
were imported to Japan either through Korea or China<br/>
afterwards.(again, I do not know the exact period)<br/>
But, in about a century later, the superior quality of<br/>
the Japanese sword was well known in the North East<br/>
Asia.<br/>
<br/>
5) The Chinese traditionally had martial arts teaching<br/>
the use of two edged straight sword. After the Mongol<br/>
conquest and their numerous skirmishes with the<br/>
Japanese pirates on their coast during Mying dynasty<br/>
made it popular to teach the use of the one edged<br/>
curved sword.<br/>
<br/>
6) People who provided the above information were<br/>
professional historians and martial artists in South<br/>
Korea. So, I believe that it is a very credible<br/>
source. The site is also managed by one of most<br/>
popular news paper reportor in South Korea.(the<br/>
counterpart of New York Time, Wall Street Journal,<br/>
Washington Post, and etc in America)<br/>
<br/>
I hope that this will help some people in the group.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
                          Sincerely,<br/>
<br/>

thank you for discussing this issue with me although i am no expert swords smith, the main point i was trying to make was that the samurai sword was curved for a reason, not by accident. infact i dont know if i mentioned this before, but that is probly why the Ninja were far worse at sword fighting then the samurai that is why i think they always had to be stealth.(as an advantage in fighting). look foward to seeing your reply and opinion on my opinion and one of the things my friends and I have wondered for a while now.<br/>

To answer your question, yes in one way it could have been because of the shape, or simply because the samurai were destand to master at what ever their job in battle was. and i dont know if that being stealth was the ninjas only advantage to winning a battle, like i said, IM NO EXPERT but i plan to talk to some and learn from some. and also maybe its that the ninja didnt belive in many things the samurai did, like its glorious to die in battle. i dont think the ninja thought that, but i have no room to talk bad about the ninja because im training in akido where we are learning about the ninja and how to fight like one.<br/>

Actually that's why I asked. I read in the misconceptions link that ninja carried samurai swords since they were samurai. But when I read this email about someone saying that a samurai was the superior fighter because of the sword I had to ask exactly what they meant. Samurai vs nija is really samurai vs. samurai.<br/>

There is no difference in swords, ninja aren't<br/>
mystical warriors who ran around in black pajamas, and<br/>
people need to go read some actual history books<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Just curious...are they a Hollywood myth or a Tokyo Studios myth?  (Or <br/>
perhaps a myth from when they wanted to portray Samurai as "Honorable <br/>
Warriors"?)<br/>

<br/>
If you are refering to the Ninja using straight swords<br/>
then I am sorry to tell you that is hollywood fiction<br/>
partial created by Stephen Hayes back in the 80's.<br/>
<br/>
It has been proven in and out of the Ninjutsu<br/>
communuty that the nInja did not carry or use straight<br/>
swords.<br/>
<br/>
one aspect of Hinjutsu is Hensojutsu - disguise. How<br/>
could a ninja deisguise himself as a samurai if he was<br/>
carrying a straigth sword.<br/>
<br/>
Ninja carried curved swords just like samurai<br/>

Hello Thomas, <br/>
 <br/>
thank you for discussing this issue with me although i<br/>
am no expert swords smith, the main point i was trying<br/>
to make was that the samurai sword was curved for a<br/>
reason, not by accident. infact i dont know if i<br/>
mentioned this before, but that is probly why the<br/>
Ninja were far worse at sword fighting then the<br/>
samurai that is why i think they always had to be<br/>
stealth.(as an advantage in fighting). look foward to<br/>
seeing your reply and opinion on my opinion and one of<br/>
the things my friends and I have wondered for a while<br/>
now.<br/>
 <br/>
