 </span></blockquote>The Ottoman's come to mind, England, maybe France (the ruling house <br/>
changed around a lot) etc. Dictatorship was the common government until <br/>
recently and is still popular in some parts of the world.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Yes it's interesting.<br/>
<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Of course....<br/>

 </span></blockquote>ROTFL. Guns don't care about fancy sword moves. The Tokugawa's were <br/>
militarily very progressive when they first took power. They could have <br/>
fought any other power straight up in 1600 and probably come out the <br/>
victor because of the size of their army and reasonable tactics and <br/>
strategy.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>I think strategy and tactics are martial arts as well, they studied <br/>
these pretty carefully when they first started!<br/>
<br/>

 </span></blockquote>The rotating hostage attendance system was a great example. Kept the <br/>
other clans broke and under their thumb.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Peasants are like rape seed, the more you squeeze them, the more oil you <br/>
get. I think that's an Ieyasu quote. What a nice guy!<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Kenjutsu never comes across as anything special in any of the lives of <br/>
the early unifiers of Japan that I've ever read, fun TV series aside. It <br/>
was like taking math, they studied the required bits because everyone of <br/>
their class did but nut much else. Otherwise it would have been the <br/>
'Musashi' bakufu ;)<br/>

could easily have mixed him up with Oda or someone else.<br/>
<br/>
I personally study 'sit on my butt-fu' myself ;)<br/>
