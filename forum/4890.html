<div id="ygrps-yiv-772562333">I once read a historical account of a samurai that mentioned of a<br/>
certain type of figurine carried by the samurai of Japan. <br/>

If I remember correctly, they were small and white with very little<br/>

 </span></blockquote>This, as far as I'm aware is a bit of a myth. I'm not saying some samurai didnt have spiritual significant 'Netsuke' commissioned, however, I think trend and fashion of the times were the biggest influence on 'Netsuke' designs. I've seen 'Netsuke' carved into skulls, saki bottles and even couples in compromising positions!<br/>
<br/>
Although I'm no expert, so hopefully you'll get some more helpful responses.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>He's got to be talking about netsuke. Rather than<br/>
having any practical use, or them being "fashionable",<br/>
some "expert" he read probably attributed some kind of<br/>
spiritual significance, since isn't everything the<br/>
samurai ever did straight out of Zen and the Hagakure?<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Sodes77--<br/>
<br/>
netsuke are toggles, fasteners, etc, fashionable in<br/>
the Edo period. They were purely decorative. Possibly<br/>
someone attributed some kind of sentimental value, if<br/>
someone's father, mother, etc. had owned it before,<br/>
but Japanese didn't go around trusting their netsuke<br/>
to save their lives or whatever. They weren't<br/>
talismans. <br/>

 </span></blockquote>Y'know, it never occurred to me that it would be netsuke -- that is so far from <br/>
the function, purpose, or design of netsuke that I wouldn't have even thought of <br/>
it. But you're probably right. Sigh.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-211896439">There's a line in Steven's book 'The Sword of No-Sword, Life of <br/>
the Master Warrior Tesshu' about a Kwannon figurine/statuette <br/>
that Tesshu carried as a gift from his mother (necessarily small, <br/>
I would have thought).<br/>
<br/>
Not sure if this is the kind of thing you mean? I can dig the book <br/>
out if you want, but I doubt it'll have the Japanese name.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>The only reference I know for this is the Taiga drama Toshie and Matsu. <br/>
Toshie had some little statue from his mother? that he wore on his <br/>
helmet. Not the greatest of historical references!<br/>
