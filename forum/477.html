<h3>Miyamoto Musashi</h3>
by <i>Matthew Dean</i>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1068549437">Hi everyone,<br/>
I would like to find out more about Miyamoto Musashi (1584-1645).<br/>
Does anyone know of any websites with information on his sword techniques or <br/>
stories of his famous duels. If he won 60 duels by the age of 28 and the <br/>
first by the age of 13. Then I'm hoping that someone knows more about him <br/>
and his incredible life. I know he wrote<br/>
"Gorin No Sho" but can you get it in the original text rather than english <br/>
copies which miss out much information.<br/>
<br/>
Many thanks,<br/>
<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-709453381">Hello.<br/>
 Regarding Gorinsho in original Japanese there is a website that was recently offering the exact replicas of the five scrolls fully bound and presented in scroll form rather than a book type. Price wise it is high but the package certainly looked worth the while..<br/>
 www.buyubooks.com<br/>
 And type 'Gorin no Sho' into the search engine there.<br/>
 You could also have a look at the other Miyamoto Musashi books they offer there for more information on his style.<br/>
 Also 'SeiDoKai' supplies have copies of their own books written as an aid to learning the forms as practised in the Niten Ichi Ryu and taught by Shihan Imai Masayuki in Japan. Type Seidokai into a search engine and you will find the site easily enough.<br/>
 Hope this helps.</div>
