Where 30m people kept the peace for 250 years<br/>
<br/>
KARACHI: Which place in the world is famous for having a population of<br/>
30 million people who managed to keep total peace for more than 250<br/>
years? The answer to this is Tokugawa Japan whose people developed<br/>
their own civilization in a self-contained environment.<br/>
<br/>
Thus it comes as no surprise that Japanese expert, Tsunenari Tokugawa,<br/>
the 18th descendant of the man who started the Tokugawa period,<br/>
believes that Pakistan can only progress if it has values and<br/>
education two things that are essential for the growth of a nation as<br/>
Japan has seen.<br/>
<br/>
Tsunenari Tokugawa was invited to speak at an event held by the 21st<br/>
Century Business & Economics Clubs (21st CBEC) and Institute of<br/>
Business Administration (IBA) on Friday evening.<br/>
<br/>
Tokugawa is the director of the Tokugawa Memorial Foundation and lives<br/>
in New York. He is also president of NYK America. The topic of his<br/>
talk was: 'Transition from Tokugawa Shogunate to Modern Japan.'<br/>
<br/>
Giving a historical account of Japan's progress, Tokugawa said that<br/>
the Tokugawa period in Japan lasted from 1603 to 1868 during which<br/>
time it progressed to the heights of which England had not seen.<br/>
<br/>
For example, the literacy rate during this period was high-70 to 80<br/>
percent among males and 40 to 50 percent among females. He said the<br/>
literacy rate in most European countries and America was much lower.<br/>
<br/>
More than 15,000 elementary schools, besides 260 Samurai schools and<br/>
2,000 private academies, were established all over Japan. The teaching<br/>
system of both regular primary schools and Samurai schools was<br/>
separate. The standard of education was very high at that time.<br/>
<br/>
The top priority of Tukugawa Japan was its strong consensus on<br/>
national security. There was strong sense of human equality under the<br/>
class system also, Tokugawa explained.<br/>
<br/>
The moral standards among the elite were high as well. He said the<br/>
elite followed the teachings of noted Chinese philosopher, Confucius.<br/>
Its people were environmentally conscious and no one cut down trees.<br/>
At the most people cut branches and bark for fuel.<br/>
<br/>
At that time, a very sophisticated market economy was flourishing in<br/>
Japan and a large number of people were living in cities. For example,<br/>
the population of Tokyo at that time was one million, whereas other<br/>
important cities such as Osaka and Kyoto had a population of over<br/>
400,000 people only.<br/>
<br/>
In 1850, Japan opened up its economy to the world and its first<br/>
agreement was signed with the United States. The government invited<br/>
technicians, professors and technological experts from the US and<br/>
European countries to teach the Japanese nation the latest technology<br/>
and literature. He said that people were taught in French and English<br/>
during the first decade, but later on all literature and technical<br/>
manuals were translated into Japanese, and after 20 years all foreign<br/>
experts were sent back. During that period a huge transition took<br/>
place and education at a higher level was also initiated in Japanese.<br/>
<br/>
From 1868 to 1945, Japan witnessed 77 years of imperial rule during<br/>
which it fought many wars, the last being World War II, which it<br/>
eventually lost. Still, Tokugawa said the Japanese managed to maintain<br/>
their values.<br/>
<br/>
Tokugawa, nevertheless, admitted that Japan is facing some social<br/>
problems. For example, young people do not marry, which is causing a<br/>
huge problem for Japanese families. He also said that more than 25<br/>
percent of the overall Japanese population is older than 65 years.<br/>
<br/>
Tokugawa also said that the old buildings were being demolished for<br/>
new and modern plazas, which was a matter of serious concern.</div>

 </span></blockquote>???  Who's better off? A Japanese peasant or a British farmer? <br/>
Especially later I think the answer is easy.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> >For example, the literacy rate during this period was high-70 to 80<br/>

><br/>
 </span></blockquote>Interesting quote, how is it figured? Does it count peasants or is it <br/>
just people, i.e. merchants and samurai... Following figures are from a <br/>
website, bs alert!<br/>
The situation in America roughly parallels that in England. In 1650, <br/>
male literacy in America was 60%. Between 1800 and 1840, literacy in the <br/>
Northern States increased from 75% to 90%, and in Southern States from <br/>
60% to 81%.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>This guy is really so full of it that I almost can't stand it... How did <br/>
they rebuild Edo which had a tendency to burn down every few years.<br/>
<br/>

 </span></blockquote>That part is true. The rise of the great cities and the merchant class <br/>
are the major event in this era.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> >and after 20 years all foreign experts were sent back. <br/>
><br/>
 </span></blockquote>Not even.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> >During that period a huge transition took place and education at a higher level was also initiated in Japanese.<br/>

><br/>
 </span></blockquote>I forget which private university in the 1900s had an Anglo dean with <br/>
the saying like "Be bold or conquer" or something along those lines.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> >>From 1868 to 1945, Japan witnessed 77 years of imperial rule during<br/>

>  <br/>
><br/>
 </span></blockquote>I wonder which ones he's talking about? Post-war Japan is an actual <br/>
democratic nation with a very modern outlook. Nobody has to sell their <br/>
daughters anymore to make ends meet.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> >Tokugawa, nevertheless, admitted that Japan is facing some social<br/>

><br/>
 </span></blockquote>Raising a family in a 400 square foot apartment would tend to put a <br/>
damper on things. A friend of mine thought Stanford had made a mistake <br/>
and put her in married housing and we told her no, a 550 square foot <br/>
studio is a fairly normal size for one person in the US.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> >Tokugawa also said that the old buildings were being demolished for<br/>

><br/>
 </span></blockquote>Some of them should be demolished, they are firetraps! While I like old <br/>
buildings, I can sympathize with my Japanese friends who can only <br/>
remember smelly toilets, poor lighting and heating.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks for sharing, it was good for a few laughs. Of course press <br/>
releases have a tendency to be overly upbeat.<br/>
