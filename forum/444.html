 A resounding YES to both of your questions. <br/>
  The 'art of war' by Sonshi (Sun Tzu) was considered 'basic' reading for <br/>
anyone who wished to understand 'Heiho' or tactics..including all Samurai <br/>
retainers..It was an essential to the Japanese Bushi and was used as far back <br/>
as the 12th century by (Minamoto) Kiso no Yoshinaka who having read it knew <br/>
that a flock of birds taking off from woodland could mean an enemy presence <br/>
in those woods..In this case it was the Taira army and he also reversed the <br/>
tactic convincing the Taira that the sounds of birds at night were a massive <br/>
Minamoto army suiting up for war!<br/>
 Regarding Hypnosis it was used in many forms and by many different <br/>
people..Sennin (wise men), Yamabushi (mountain ascetics), and Ninja have all <br/>
had hypnosis added to their skills..And the Samurai also used the same kind <br/>
of self hypnosis in the chanting of Mudra and forming of 'Ingei' (finger <br/>
knots) to draw upon 'supernatural powers' from a variety of divinities..Fudo <br/>
Myo O being a major one.<br/>
 Kuji and Juji were methods used by Bushi to perform a type of hynosis on an <br/>
enemy..while the enemy was watching the hands or listening the attack could <br/>
be made..and the chanting of spells would have caused a panic to a highly <br/>
superstitious group such as the Japanese Samurai..<br/>
 More will undoubtedly follow from the rest of us here but I hope this is a <br/>
start for you.<br/>
 Abayo.<br/>
