explains very little about Nagashima castle before Ikko-Ikki.<br/>
It was Jin-ya style, which means it was with single Kuruwa ( to be<br/>
honest, i can't think the word Kuruwa is suitable for Jin-ya), <br/>
surrounded with moats and embankments.<br/>

Please excuse my ignorance but can you tell me what Kuruwa or Jin-ya <br/>
means?<br/>

	Before the age of large-scale castles, a simple fortification <br/>
was set up on the battlefield to protect the commanders seat and or <br/>
his sleeping quarters. A simple hut hastily constructed with wooden <br/>
sheilds strategically placed all around it and then enclosed with <br/>
"curtains" to hide activity within from the eyes of the enemy. <br/>
Variations of this may be seen in many a film and taiga drama. These <br/>
are called Jin-ya.<br/>
	A kuruwa is "an enclosure", and I suppose could be used to <br/>
describe something as simple as the above though today it is used to <br/>
talk about the "sections" of a castle ie; Kaku, ichi no maru, ni no <br/>
maru , san no maru...Perhaps they mean "Jinjo" another simple <br/>
fortification but with moats and stockades?<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-691923659">Cheers for explaining Tom,<br/>
<br/>
If I remember correctly the castle at Nagashima was built by one of <br/>
Oda Nobunaga's retainers. Would it be that plain and not have a <br/>
central keep? <br/>
