<div id="ygrps-yiv-1844708786">the samurai used a multitude amount of weapons some samurai actually <br/>
made their own weapons the only reason why they didn't use some of <br/>
then was because of the weight how much force it takes to use it and <br/>
weather or not they used it depended mainly on the way they felt about <br/>
the weapon. arrows were one of the first weapons they started using <br/>
because of fortress walls. The spear was used by many of the great <br/>
samurai which is why their is so many different styles of sword <br/>
fighting. The sword was a sacred weapon to the samurai but if you read <br/>
the rules of some old clans some of them say certain things like <br/>
nobody but a certain group was allowed to use the sword(shinsengumi). <br/>
the shogun was normally a master of a certain style of fightingand <br/>
taught the soldiers themselves. I still don't know why they choose <br/>
farmers to become samurai all the books that i read say that samurai <br/>
were just farmers with a sword. im not sure wheather or not they had <br/>
berserkers for soldiers but normally if a samurai goes into to many <br/>
fights the samurai went completely berserk.</div>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-624860511">Greetings.<br/>
  Please clarify the reference to "bullshido". Is this an affront to the Bushido that it is not worth anything? Or is this an affront to those who would make extreme and pointless interpretations of Bushido, thus it becoming "bull"?<br/>
   <br/>
  Thanks<br/>
