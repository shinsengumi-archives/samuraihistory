BERLIN (Hollywood Reporter) - Yoji Yamada's "The Hidden Blade" <br/>
continues the themes, settings and depiction of samurai heroism he <br/>
so brilliantly developed in his last film, "The Twilight Samurai" <br/>
(2002). A graceful pace allows Yamada to explore fully the life of a <br/>
lower-caste samurai in a rural fiefdom, where money is always in <br/>
short supply and clan pressures lurk just outside his compound. <br/>
Yamada again turns to the short stories of Shuhei Fujisawa to draw <br/>
an indelible portrait of a solitary samurai with an unyielding code <br/>
of honor and dignity that never will allow him to stray even for a <br/>
moment into disgrace.<br/>
<br/>
As with "Twilight Samurai," which earned international appreciation <br/>
and an Oscar nomination for best foreign-language film, "The Hidden <br/>
Blade" will do well in urban specialty venues in many markets.<br/>
<br/>
Structurally, the two films are remarkably similar. (Yamada wrote <br/>
this screenplay with Yoshitaka Asama.) In the first act, a samurai <br/>
(Masatoshi Nagase) must rescue a woman (Takako Matsu) being abused <br/>
in her married life. The second act witnesses an unspoken love bloom <br/>
between these two even as the samurai's loyalty is called into <br/>
question by corrupt superiors.<br/>
<br/>
The third act contains a dual to the death between the samurai, who <br/>
never has killed, and a man the clan has ordered him to kill. This <br/>
time, the opponent is a friend and brother samurai (Yukiyoshi <br/>
Ozawa), whose life he does not wish to take.<br/>
<br/>
This new story takes place at the moment in the mid-19th century <br/>
when European weaponry and military strategies are imported into <br/>
Japan's conservative, feudal society. Much of this is played for <br/>
comedy as soldiers awkwardly struggle to understand rifles, cannons <br/>
and alien military training so at odds with the old-school methods <br/>
of sword and knife. Yet you sense a kind of moral corruption has <br/>
entered Japanese society, too, ushered in by these new and <br/>
impersonal weapons.<br/>
<br/>
The hero in both stories is virtually the same man, who very much <br/>
represents the old school. His unswerving righteous might be boring <br/>
were it not so fascinating to watch the samurai maneuver in a <br/>
difficult society where divided loyalties and easy corruption litter <br/>
his daily path. Similarly, the beauty and purity of the heroine <br/>
might come off as bland were it not so touching to watch the <br/>
mistreated woman blossom in the samurai's warm and caring household.<br/>
<br/>
Yamada has performed a minor miracle with these two samurai films: <br/>
He has managed a portrait of goodness and virtue that is neither <br/>
cynical nor contrived. The director clearly believes in the samurai <br/>
spirit and code. By reviving it on the screen with such empathy, <br/>
Yamada demonstrates the true complexity of a simple life lived well.<br/>
<br/>
This is a marvelously produced film from its quiet appreciation for <br/>
the countryside to the minute details in its interior design. A <br/>
mostly Western-style music score by Isao Tomita skillfully <br/>
intertwines the classic with the intimate. <br/>
