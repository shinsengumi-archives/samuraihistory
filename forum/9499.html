<div id="ygrps-yiv-735624157">-Everything2.com/wikipedia.org/ask.com were the three I found it on. I <br/>
just found it hard to believe that ordinary poor folks like Fuu, Mugen <br/>
and Jin or Gin would be using such high monetary denominations however <br/>
all references to money in SC seem to be in ryos or yen. No offense but <br/>
I do not always take everything at face value my tomo. Arigato again <br/>
for the help which you flks always seem to give me. I am always ready <br/>
to reciprocate with anime info. Kami bless you and toodles-K&K<br/>

 </span></blockquote>K&K<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> ><br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Well I can't confirm or deny the accuracy of the statement itself, <br/>
except to wonder when in the Edo period.  To my knowledge, the value of <br/>
coin many times fluctuated heavily especially since it was a rice based <br/>
economy.  Another factor is the minting itself which varied in quality <br/>
and quantity and I know that inflation and widespread dept <br/>
cancellations had a big influence as well.  All and all, regardless of <br/>
the source I would have to question the accuracy of the number itself <br/>
regardless just because of all these factors.</div>
