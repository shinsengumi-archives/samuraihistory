<h3>Hagakure crest</h3>

I was hoping someone might be able to help me. I would like to know <br/>
to which family the crest used in the movie ghost dog and on some <br/>
editions of the hagakure belongs. The crest, made up of three birds, <br/>
can be seen here for example:<br/>

<br/>
I stand to be corrected of course... but although the design appears to be a "MON" (Family Crest), of three crescent shaped birds intertwined at 120degrees, I feel that it is a modern creation and not "traditional".  It is a lot easier to say what it is not rather than what it is.... There are a few native birds represented in various mon - Crane, Sparrow, Wild Goose, Crow, Mandarin Duck, Dove, Hawk and the domestic Chicken (I suppose we should also add the Pheonix!) - non of these are similar to the ones represented in the "Ghost Dog" crest. The best description of which I would say Swan or Goose.  Having said all this I know I have in my collection a crest design of a bird in flight similar in nature to the birds in your crest... I believe it came from a modern japanese design book but cannot as yet remember!!<br/>
<br/>
Best wishes with the investigations...        <br/>

I agree I think this is taken from "Japanese Design Motifs", or a <br/>
similar book, a modern mon created in the traditional style...<br/>
