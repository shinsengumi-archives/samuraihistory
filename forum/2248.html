<div id="ygrps-yiv-536072243">Right.<br/>
<br/>
But the point is that it SAYS Takeda Shingen. Several<br/>
people weighed in with their opinions of who it was<br/>
(correct or incorrect), and those who were correct<br/>
didn't explain WHY. That's not helpful to those they<br/>
are trying to correct. Regardless of if you could<br/>
recognize the armor/helmet, etc. IT'S GOT THE GUY'S<br/>
FREAKING NAME ON IT!!<br/>
<br/>
I would think that even if you had no idea about<br/>
Japanese history or Takeda Shingen, before you went<br/>
hawking it you'd at least try to get someone to<br/>
translate the darn Japanese on it. <br/>
