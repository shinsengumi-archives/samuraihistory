<div id="ygrps-yiv-226108214">A film that I did not see mention.  I beleive that it is a recent release.  <br/>
Is TABOU   think I am speeling it correct.   Has anyone seen this moive and <br/>
what are your thoughts on it.  <br/>
<br/>
Also;  going out on a limb;  I got very interesting in the Laura Joh Rowland <br/>
Novels.  If anyone has read them and although the most of the cahractors tomy <br/>
knowlege are fictious.   How accurate is she in showing the customes and <br/>
prtocal of the courts for this time frame.  <br/>
<br/>
Another Two book Serious  by Takashi Matsuoka   Cloud of Sparrows & Autumn <br/>
Bridge<br/>
<br/>
   I read both of these novels.  Most of the people that I have turned on to <br/>
this these books told me that they could nto stop reading.  Would like to know <br/>
if anyone has red them and thier thoughts.  Mostly portaining to the time <br/>
period in which it is in.   <br/>
<br/>
Qustion I am hoping that I am not sending the rpior post with my reply.  I <br/>
have tried deleteing the ost before but AOL only lets you select copy when doing <br/>
this.   <br/>
<br/>
In the Laura Joh Rowland novels she show some aspect of intimacy between <br/>
Samuria;  I late see this in the above mention movie.   <br/>
<br/>
   Was this a practice?  And I beleive that it was said  "That they were <br/>
sharing some condisered this sahring Bushido..  But I am not at all sure that this <br/>
would be histroically correct.   Is there documatation that shows this to be <br/>
true.  <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-841309821">Laurah Joh Rowland's books are fairly good in being historically accurate. There's the occasional error and of course a lot of literary license is taken (the killers who have mastered the touch of death and the killing scream).<br/>
She can be very brutal in describing samurai arms and armor (many times sounding like she's describing a European Knight). Her early books are the best-the last few have been somewhat weak, but the latest (released July 31), "The Assassin's Touch", was a nice return to form.<br/>
Cloud of Sparrows had the background history correct but much of the behavior of the Japanese characters was out of date. It belonged more to the samurai of the Sengoku era. The story was completely outlandish, but very entertaining-I enjoyed the book quite a bit. Autumn Bridge, on the other hand, veered way off the tracks, crashed, and burned.  Another entertaining fiction series is a set of samurai mysteries penned by (hope I get the name right) I. L. Parker. They're set much earlier, in Heian Japan, and the titles include Rashomon, The Hell Screen, and The Dragon Scroll. One I would avoid like the plague is The Tales Of The Otori Clan series. It has quite a few fans and is supposed to be made into a film, but for me it lacked any sort of Oriental/Japanese flavor (it's set in a Japan like fantasy land-I suppose it appeals to the Legend Of The Five Rings RPG crowd). It came across much more as European medieval fantasy.</div>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1809105491">Thank for the post...  I have read all but the last ones mention..  I have <br/>
not read the last of the Laura joh Rowland books ;  will check it out..  <br/>
<br/>
I had a hard time reading Autumn Bridge at first...  but then about mid way <br/>
through the book the light kicked on; after that I could not stop turning the <br/>
pages.   <br/>
<br/>
   Will look into the series you spoke of also.  I kinda thought about <br/>
weahter are not that much prtocal would be going on in the era that Clound of <br/>
Sparrows was in.   but like you enjoyed it..  Was a fun read. although as in shogun. <br/>
 I doubt that an american would be able to get away with taht much in Jpan <br/>
suring the era.  Was the only thing I did not care for in the book.  Thanks <br/>
again for the post...  Liketoknow what I am reading even though fiction is showing <br/>
the time and era in a hsitorical pretext.  <br/>
