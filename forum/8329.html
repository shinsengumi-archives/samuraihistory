Depending on what period of Japanese history you like, I might recommend <br/>
either the more recent Yoshitsune, or the older one about Hideyoshi.<br/>

<br/>
Even the best of the Taiga drams will take liberties with history if it <br/>
makes a better story or add details that are not documented. So enjoy <br/>
them as entertainment and not as history.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Taiga Drama are the yearly NHK 50 episode historical<br/>
dramas shown every Sunday at 8 PM (and rebroadcast<br/>
through the week on the BS channels, if you have<br/>
cable). Do you specifically mean Taiga Drama, or are<br/>
you meaning to ask about jidai geki, which is the term<br/>
for any period historical drama? NHK currently has 3<br/>
jidai geki series running, but the current Taiga<br/>
Drama, Komyo ga Tsuji, is only one of them (and the<br/>
lesser quality of the two I've seen. I'm still<br/>
recording it, though.)<br/>

point in putting English subtitles on programs for a<br/>
Japanese audience. However I know you can find them<br/>
with English subtitles on the Japanese cable channels<br/>
broadcast in the United States. <br/>

bittorrent, if you can find it. You certainly can't<br/>
get them for free from NHK--50 episode Taiga dramas<br/>
sell for around $300-$400 US dollars. <br/>

NHK TV series shows with English subtitles. The prices vary but all <br/>
were much cheaper than here. If you want to buy a TV series here in <br/>
Japan you must pay at a minimum $300.<br/>
<br/>
Also you can run a web search for Japanese Drama.<br/>
<br/>
Good luck!<br/>

but a good bet is "Chushingura" is one or 5 of them.<br/>
