<h3>RE: [samuraihistory] Top Ten Samurai Movies</h3>

<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-457360114">Hello everyone, coming out of lurk-dom. I just joined the email group though<br/>
I've been posting on the Delphi message board under the tag line<br/>
"Nevermore..." (which is a NFL football reference, as I participate in some<br/>
other Delphi forums and we discuss football. But needless to say, I won't<br/>
discuss football here). I also participate (I'm a moderator) in the Ninja<br/>
Dojo Samurai Film message board on EZBoard and there, I'm known as "Wave<br/>
Tossed" (which I use for Amazon.com book and movie reviews and IMDB movie<br/>
reviews). Email me if you want more information on the Ninja Dojo site.<br/>
 <br/>
So just a little introduction: My name is Nina Boal, I'm female, American<br/>
(live in the Baltimore, Maryland region), in my late fifties. I became<br/>
interested in Japanese history many years ago when I was studying kendo. I<br/>
studied kendo for around ten years, achieving the rank of shodan. A severe<br/>
back injury has taken me out of kendo study. Now I have severe arthritis of<br/>
the knees and am wondering if I could ever take up the study of iaido at<br/>
this late stage, even with crippled knees. I do participate in swimming<br/>
exercise and physical therapy to try and make my knees stronger but I still<br/>
cannot sit in the seiza position because of my knees. <br/>
 <br/>
In the meantime, I became a fan of Japanese cinema, particularly period<br/>
dramas, jidai-geki and chambara films. The swordfighting in chambara films<br/>
is not usually related to real kenjutsu or kendo; one of my kendo senseis<br/>
used to admonish his students by telling us, "that's not kendo, that's<br/>
chambara!!" Still, I like watching these films. <br/>
 <br/>
Which have inspired me to begin writing period pieces. I started out writing<br/>
in fantasy/science fiction and have had several short stories published in<br/>
anthologies that have been available on the mass market. But my direction in<br/>
writing has shifted to writing historical pieces, particularly about<br/>
Japanese samurai. One of my efforts is "Stray Dogs," which you can read on<br/>
the Samurai Archives web site. It won the First Samurai Fiction Short Story<br/>
contest. It is about a man whom I've been interested in for years, Fuwa<br/>
Kazuemon, one of the Forty Seven Ronin. I'm currently working on a novel<br/>
involving completely fictional characters that takes place in 18th century<br/>
Japan. <br/>
 <br/>
So, finally to get to the topic here. I'm a huge film buff. So here are my<br/>
Top Ten Samurai Movies. The order is not static, though SEPPUKU ("Hara<br/>
Kiri") always remains on the top:<br/>
 <br/>
1. Seppuku (aka "Hara Kiri"): The best movie made, period, on any subject<br/>
from any country. Nakadai (Tsugumo Hanshiro) and Ishihama (Chijiiwa Motome)<br/>
were both stunning, as was Tamba (Onodaka Hikokuro) playing a real<br/>
slimeball. A study of false "bushido" versus the real way of the warrior. A<br/>
film made in 1962 about some 17th century Japanese people, and we're still<br/>
avidly discussing it in 2005 all over the world. Illustrates the staying<br/>
power of a true classic.<br/>
<br/>
2. The Seven Samurai: Another real classic and deservedly so. The first<br/>
samurai film I had ever seen. <br/>
<br/>
3. The Last Samurai directed by Misumi, not the one by Zwick with Cruise in<br/>
it (don't get me started on that one... ) A truly epic film that captures<br/>
the end of the feudal era and the beginning of a more modern era in Japan. <br/>
<br/>
4. Three Outlaw Samurai: I believe that this was Gosha's first film. This<br/>
time, Tamba Tetsuro plays the oppressed good guy who comes to the aid of<br/>
those even more oppressed than he is. <br/>
<br/>
5. Tange Sazen: I'm just listing the character's name because all of the<br/>
versions I've seen of this tale are tied for this position: Gosha's two<br/>
films (with Yorozuya Kinnosuke and also with Nakadai Tatsuya), the older<br/>
films with Otomo Ryutaro plus another with Tamba Tetsuro; and the new one<br/>
with Toyokawa: all are quality films about this fascinating one-eyed,<br/>
one-armed swordsman.<br/>
<br/>
6. Goyokin: Nakadai again, playing a man haunted by his role in the<br/>
slaughter of a fishing village, and how he makes amends for what he has done<br/>
as he saves another fishing village from slaughter.<br/>
<br/>
7. Samurai Wolf: Natsuyagi Isao is great as a scroungy, hungry ronin named<br/>
Kiba Okaminosuke ("Fangs of the Wolf") who comes into town working for food.<br/>
He wants to be a fierce "wolf" but in many ways, is more like a sweet,<br/>
wistful puppy dog. Though he does wield a really mean sword. Natsuyagi also<br/>
plays Fuwa Kazuemon in the TV special DAI CHUSHINGURA and does an excellent<br/>
job there as well. <br/>
<br/>
8. Shogun's Samurai: The Yagyu Conspiracy: Grand tragedy with a big cast of<br/>
stellar performers. <br/>
<br/>
Tied for ninth/tenth place:<br/>
Hidden Blade: A recent film about a man who must decide between loyalty and<br/>
doing the right thing according to his beliefs. <br/>
After The Rain: A ronin and his wife find that there are more important<br/>
things than fame or position. <br/>
Twilight Samurai: Sanada is magnificent as a low-ranked, impoverished<br/>
samurai (who is an excellent swordsman) who must deal with raising his<br/>
family as a single parent, and also must deal with a difficult task given to<br/>
him by his lord. <br/>

<h3>Re: Top Ten Samurai Movies</h3>
by <i>kurotatsunoshi</i>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-964565420">My interest in samurai films covers all aspects of the warriors, so <br/>
my list is somewhat varied. Most of the films here have been well <br/>
discussed, and deserve their status. While I have lots of (very) <br/>
obscure favorites, these are all benchmark films. <br/>
1)Seven Samurai-simply the best. <br/>
2)Kwaidan-the Japanese were (and are) very superstitious, and this <br/>
compilation of four macabre tales is excellent. Art direction, <br/>
photography, acting, and sound are all top notch. The highlight is <br/>
the segment involving the spirits of the Taira from the battle of Dan-<br/>
No-Ura.<br/>
3)Shogun-yeah, the 2 hour movie version sucked. And it's loaded with <br/>
historical inaccuracies. But the 12 hour mini has stunning sets, <br/>
costuming, great acting (from the Japanese part of the cast-never <br/>
been a Chamberlain fan) and an involving story. Were it not for <br/>
Shogun, much of the Western interest in Japanese history and cinema <br/>
would never have happened. The King Of Ninja Misinformation, Stephen <br/>
Hayes, makes his split second film debut.<br/>
4)Castle of The Spider's Web (Throne Of Blood)-great performance by <br/>
Mifune along with Kurosawa's typically fantastic art direction and <br/>
photography. This is his samurai flavored remake of Macbeth. <br/>
5)Heaven & Earth-Some folks really hate this film. I think it's <br/>
great. The battle scenes are among the best ever put to screen <br/>
(albeit relatively bloodless). While the backstory of Uesugi Kenshin <br/>
was well done, the film could have stood a bit more of it. The <br/>
juxtaposition of the battles with scenes of nature is very Japanese.<br/>
6)Daimajin-a great samurai film all on its own, AND you get one of <br/>
the most convincing Japanese giant monsters too! The evil god Majin <br/>
inhabits the stone state of the province's protector and mashes the <br/>
bad guys in the closing minutes of the film. If you went into this <br/>
film cold, it's left up in the air whether Majin is just a legend or <br/>
the real thing until he makes his grand appearance.<br/>
7)Hanzo The Razor:The Snare-a great break from the tired genre of <br/>
noble ronin films. The Hanzo films work as drama, parody, comedy and <br/>
chambara. It's still hard to believe Katsu could make such disparate <br/>
characters as Hanzo and Zatoichi work-it's sometimes incomprehensible <br/>
that it's the same guy. And speaking of hard, the Hanzo films take <br/>
the genre to new heights of bizarre set pieces.<br/>
8)Yojimbo-set the standard for the `anti hero' ronin film, and did it <br/>
with style.<br/>
9)Zatoichi & The Festival Of Fire-you could plug just about any <br/>
Zatoichi film into this slot-they're basically all the same, but <br/>
always enjoyable. For my money, Zatoichi is the best recurring <br/>
character in Japanese cinema (other than Godzilla). The recent remake <br/>
is good too.<br/>
10)Hara Kiri-the best of the noble ronin films, the 2 ½ hrs just fly <br/>
by. Riveting performances and a completely believable story. You'll <br/>
be hating the Ii clan after seeing this.<br/>
Honorable mention to Ran and Kagemusha, both of which are classics <br/>
but just flawed enough to keep them out of my top 10. <br/>
And for best Taiga drama-Toshiie & Matsu. OK, it's a `chick' Taiga <br/>
drama, but Toshiie is such an engaging goof and Matsu is just plain <br/>
adorable.</div>

<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-2100447545">as you asked i would like to answer your question to the top ten <br/>
samurai movies.<br/>
but i will not bore you with ten but my number one if you do not <br/>
mind.<br/>
<br/>
1 by far is kagemusha directed by the legendary kurosawa akira-sama<br/>
first of all because of the story, the setting, the thin line <br/>
between reality and fiction.but also because of the stunning acting <br/>
of nakadai.(no need to say i am an impressed person by the live <br/>
work  and teaching of the late lord shingen-ko).the movie is shot in <br/>
such a way that it is you who is watching all the events.<br/>
<br/>
i want to thank you for your top ten because i did not know all <br/>
those titles yet.so you got me on a search for some more movies to <br/>
watch, doumo arigatou<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1769666789">Thanks,<br/>
I have to agree on "Hara Kiri"  I just saw this the other night...the<br/>
Criterion version....great storyline, acting, and fantastic ending. <br/>
I'm somewhat an armor fan, and Kagemusha was great eye candy...also<br/>
really liked the hidden fortress...no one seems to have mentioned it<br/>
so far...<br/>
<br/>
I'm kind of suprised there is not an epic film based on the 47 Ronin,<br/>
especially since this event is so steeped in Samurai tradition and honor.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>ALL:<br/>
<br/>
We've gotten some new members recently, and I've<br/>
noticed some issues with the last few emails.<br/>
<br/>
Nothing is wrong with writing long emails--write away.<br/>
But PLEASE, if you are REPLYING to an email, then<br/>
DELETE all of the email EXCEPT the portions to which<br/>
you are directly replying. If, like the above poster<br/>
did, you are replying with a general reply ("Thanks,<br/>
appreciate the info", etc.) then DELETE all except a<br/>
line or two of the message to which you are replying,<br/>
so we can identify the person to whom you are<br/>
replying. <br/>
<br/>
If, for instance, I was replying to someone's email on<br/>
top 10 movie choices but only wanted to comment on<br/>
their #4 choice, I'd delete the rest of it in the<br/>
reply, and only leave the relevant comments on choice<br/>
#4. <br/>
<br/>
And please, the proper way to reply is to BOTTOM post.<br/>
Conversations work when A makes a comment, B replies.<br/>
The natural order is A then B. If B writes his comment<br/>
before A's message, it's more difficult to ID exactly<br/>
*what* B is referring to. <br/>
<br/>
This isn't hard, and makes things easier on the reader<br/>
(you) and the moderator (me). <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1253607468">Hello,<br/>
<br/>
My name is Jerome and I am most of the time just reading. But I would <br/>
like to introduce a few movies which were not talken about yet. I don't <br/>
even know if they qualifiy as Samurai movies, but I really want to share <br/>
them ;)<br/>
<br/>
The number have no relation avout the quality of movies.<br/>
<br/>
Just sorry for my english, as not native speaker.<br/>
<br/>
1- "Sansho Dayu" (in Japan), "Sansho the baillif" or "the baillif" (in <br/>
US). by Kenji Mizoguchi<br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0047445/">http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0047445/</a><br/>
<br/>
In the XIth century, Tamaki leaves with her two children, Zushio and <br/>
Anju, in order to join her husband a governor whose open mind made him <br/>
exiled in a further province. On the way, Tamaki is kidnapped and <br/>
brought to Sado Island where she has to become a prostitute. The two <br/>
kids are sent in a terrible workcamp ruled by Sansho. While growing, <br/>
Zushio becames almost as cruel as Sansho.<br/>
<br/>
2- "Ugetsu Monogatari" (in Japan), "Tales of Ugetsu" or "Tales of a Pale <br/>
and Mysterious Moon After the Rain" (in US). by Kenji Mizoguchi<br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0046478/">http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0046478/</a><br/>
<br/>
This movie is about the story of two poor young men, Genjuro and Tobei, <br/>
whose greed and ambition make them abandon their lives. Genjuro is a <br/>
potmaker which leaves his village to go to town and earn as much money, <br/>
and Tobei leaves just everything, including his wife, to become a <br/>
samurai. Both will have to face the ferocity and bitterness of medieval <br/>
society before to understand where they can find their own "salvation".<br/>

no one cared for these movies.  <br/>
<br/>
Athough they do not show a side of Musashi that many do not see.  His love <br/>

I think that someone in this forum turned me on to a webpage; that has some <br/>

 </span></blockquote>Well, for starters, his books contain mistakes in<br/>
history so great that your average Japanese 2nd grader<br/>
would laugh at them. Sure, he studied in Japan--that<br/>
doesn't mean he's publishing correct information.<br/>
Opinions will vary--what cannot be denied is that his<br/>
grasp of history is EXTREMELY flawed, if you want to<br/>
be kind, or dead flat wrong in myriad ways, if you<br/>
want to be blunt. As I've said when discussing Hayes<br/>
before: He may be a wonderful martial artist, and no<br/>
doubt he could take me in a streetfight. However, I<br/>
will not respect anyone who blatantly prints such<br/>
inaccurate historical information. And I'm not talking<br/>
about his "ninja clan" stuff--simple well-known facts<br/>
about Oda Nobunaga and so forth, things EVERY Japanese<br/>
schoolkid would know, are completely garbled and spit<br/>
out as useless trash. <br/>
<br/>
Kitsuno's been on my case to finish a review of one of<br/>
his books and publish it--unfortunately, his books are<br/>
such unpalatable trash that I have difficulty going<br/>
back and doing so. <br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Your daughter is more than welcome to post here.<br/>
Honest questions about samurai/Japanese history are<br/>
welcomed and will be answered. Problems occur when:<br/>
<br/>
a. people come in with preconceived notions shaped by<br/>
pop culture and refuse to accept that pop culture is<br/>
wrong 80% of the time, at least. We are all wrong at<br/>
some point in our lives, and it's better to learn to<br/>
accept it and learn from it then defend mistaken<br/>
ideas. <br/>
<br/>
b. People ignore the "history" portion of the "Samurai<br/>
History" groups. While martial arts are okay as a<br/>
side-topic in relation to the Samurai, this is NOT a<br/>
martial-arts forum. Additionally, "I read in a comic<br/>
book", "my sensei told me so", and "I saw in a<br/>
movie/anime/tv show" aren't considered accurate<br/>
historical references, and anyone who uses these as<br/>
documentation for supposed facts deserves whatever<br/>
rebuttal with historical sources they get. Many<br/>
"history" books aren't correct, either. Turnbull does<br/>
a great job of getting information into English, and<br/>
I've got a collection of many of his books. However,<br/>
some I wish I hadn't wasted money on--sometimes he (or<br/>
his editor) gets lazy and prints counterfactual<br/>
information, and he tends to publish the same<br/>
information (complete with the<br/>
same...anecdotes...over...and...over). ALL sources<br/>
need to be verified, doublechecked, or corroborated.<br/>
Sansom, God love him, while a great source of overview<br/>
knowledge, has sadly been passed up by a lot of recent<br/>
research, and is downright wrong on some things.<br/>
[/rant]<br/>
<br/>
Sorry, got off-track there. The bottom line of the<br/>
above is that even real historical sources aren't<br/>
always "right", so when a question is asked here, it's<br/>
not always easy to give a simple answer. Honestly,<br/>
many people ask superficial questions--as if all<br/>
Samurai were the same, and what applied to one samurai<br/>
applied to another in all cases, regardless of<br/>
station, socio-economic status, time period, location,<br/>
etc. A lot of romanticized ideals bring people here,<br/>
and as with any romanticized ideal, the reality is<br/>
sort of sobering and disappointing to some.<br/>
Personally, I find the betrayal, self-serving<br/>
aggression, and general chaos of the Sengoku to be<br/>
much more interesting than the idea that all samurai<br/>
followed this neat little code called Bushido and<br/>
committed seppuku if they sneezed in public. It's<br/>
asked of every member who signs up that they read the<br/>
Top Ten (11) misconceptions of the Samurai webpage,<br/>
which serves as the baseline for discussion. <br/>
<br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.geocities.com/klancesegall/home.htm">http://www.geocities.com/klancesegall/home.htm</a><br/>
<br/>
Anyone who wants to challenge those statements may do<br/>
so, but the weight of Japanese Historical Scholastic<br/>
Endeavours, in both English and Japanese, is against<br/>
you. <br/>
<br/>
Lastly, it's an internet web discussion group--nothing<br/>
anyone says should be taken personally. Some people<br/>
tend to load their messages with irony (I've been<br/>
accused of this...) and some people take that<br/>
personally. Don't. I don't know you, and you don't<br/>
know me. If someone comes around making claims of<br/>
speaking fluent Japanese and having XYZ amount of<br/>
knowledge, I'm immediately suspicious. I've studied<br/>
Japanese for 11 years now, live in Japan, deal with<br/>
Japanese government officials on official business in<br/>
Japanese on a daily basis, rented a house and make<br/>
bank transactions in Japanese, and I still (and<br/>
probably never will) don't consider myself "fluent".<br/>
However, this happened on another board, and when I<br/>
asked if said person could function in Japan, that<br/>
person provided me with ample evidence chronicling his<br/>
last 30 years or so in Japan. Skepticism gone. What it<br/>
all boils down to is being able to back up your<br/>
statements/assertions with documentable facts and<br/>
experience, and if you can't, being willing to accept<br/>
the answers of those who can. <br/>
<br/>
Welcome to your daughter, we look forward to her<br/>
questions and contributions to the board. Any issues,<br/>
please report them to me or Kitsuno, and they'll be<br/>
dealt with. <br/>
<br/>
Nate<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-64509739">Hi again,<br/>
<br/>
I would like to bounce on Nate's message to ask some more questions.<br/>
<br/>
I am poorly educated about Japanese history but I am trying to improve <br/>
and I am often facing the fact that many authors are saying totally <br/>
opposite from one to another. So, as you spoke about Turnbull and Samson <br/>
(I don't have any of these books), and are explaining why their books <br/>
might include mistakes, I would be more than happy to have some help <br/>
about what books to choose to help me to understand Japanese history, <br/>
how reliable they are and maybe how to read them. I mean for what kind <br/>
of info I might rely on them and for what kind of info I shouldn't. I am <br/>
not sure I am clear enough.<br/>
<br/>
I am more interested right now about Momoyama period and the whole <br/>
"reign" of Hideyoshi, but, unfortunately I can only read in French or <br/>
English.<br/>
<br/>
The books I got right now (please let me know if they include bad <br/>
information):<br/>
- Samurai: An Illustrated History by Mitsuo Kure;<br/>
- &#22259;&#37682;&#26085;&#26412;&#12398;&#30002;&#20881;&#27494;&#20855;&#20107;&#20856; (I hope i am pasting the right letters);<br/>
- Samurai Invasion by Turnbull<br/>
- Samurai Sourcebook by Turnbull<br/>
- The Cambridge history of Japan : vol 4 : early modern history.<br/>
- Another book in Japanese about Oda nobunaga's followers (i was <br/>
actually looking for the sengoku jinmei jiten but I went through this one).<br/>
- Some books about various side topics which are not about what I am <br/>
asking advice now (art, ethics and so on...)<br/>
<br/>
I know there is a "recommended readings" section on <br/>
www.samurai-archives.com , but without comments it is pretty hard for me <br/>
to appraise books (and authors) quality. Sorry for such a broad <br/>
question, but I guess several people might be interested too.<br/>
<br/>
So, if you have any suggestions, I would be more than happy.<br/>
<br/>

 </span></blockquote>The first step is realizing you've got a<br/>
problem...just kidding (that's an Alcoholics Anonymous<br/>
joke). Seriously, though--we're all trying to improve,<br/>
and as long as we realize what we don't know, it's<br/>
easier to find out more stuff. <br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Turnbull is a touchy subject around some people, as<br/>
some people love him, others hate him. In his favor,<br/>
he's probably the most prolific author in English on<br/>
the subject, some of his books are excellently<br/>
detailed (the Samurai Sourcebook being a great book),<br/>
and he generally doesn't put out too much<br/>
misinformation on purpose. <br/>
<br/>
On the bad side, his early works were accused of<br/>
plagiarism, many of his later books are simply<br/>
rewrites/reshuffles of earlier books with the same<br/>
info/anecdotes under different titles, and in many of<br/>
his Osprey works he's not very careful to check his<br/>
facts/spelling/editing/etc. Samurai Warfare, 1465-1600<br/>
is the biggest waste of money I've ever had the<br/>
mispleasure of buying. Some of his works are obvious<br/>
attempts at repackaging previous info, or writing<br/>
stuff off the top of his head to simply sell another<br/>
book. So, while some of his stuff is great, be careful<br/>
with it. Read it, then verify it with other sources.<br/>
Turnbull books I recommend: Nagashino 1575, The<br/>
Samurai Sourcebook, any of the Samurai<br/>
Warriors/Samurai Warlords/Lone Samurai and the Martial<br/>
Arts/etc. I'd be dubious of much of his Osprey work<br/>
unless you can verify it with something else--it just<br/>
smacks of mass production. <br/>
<br/>
George B. Sansom compiled a fabulous History of Japan<br/>
in 3 volumes. It's epic--and a must-read. However, he<br/>
makes several notable mistakes, makes statements that<br/>
have since been shown to be false, etc. It's<br/>
good--don't get me wrong. But particularly his Sengoku<br/>
period (1333-1615) information gets a little too<br/>
shallow. A must as a background read, but for<br/>
specifics, delve deeper. <br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> > I am more interested right now about Momoyama period<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Mary Berry's "Hideyoshi" is an excellent read.<br/>
"Japonius Tyrannus" is about Nobunaga, but provides<br/>
lots of good scholarly info. Sansom would help provide<br/>
good background, of course. <br/>
<br/>
One book I'd recommend, even though it's fiction, is<br/>
Yoshikawa Eiji's "Hideyoshi", available in<br/>
English--not sure about French. Even though it's<br/>
fictitious, and horribly didactic, it does lay out the<br/>
commonly believed episodes from Hideyoshi's early<br/>
life, and matches most other sources that I've seen,<br/>
at least in the events. The only bad part of the book<br/>
is that it drips with hero-worship; there are only so<br/>
many times I can read about how brilliant Hideyoshi<br/>
was without gagging.<br/>

Sourcebook and Samurai Invasion are two of Turnbull's<br/>
better works. <br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>It's hard until you start reading through things. Most<br/>
of those books are excellent, but every author, no<br/>
matter how good, has his/her own tendencies, biases,<br/>
etc. Knowledge comes not from reading one or two<br/>
books, but from reading and comparing many sources and<br/>
trying to find the common picture. This is why I say<br/>
movies and anime, etc., are not good sources and<br/>
should not be treated as such. If it's hard to find<br/>
agreement in scholarly historical books, then how much<br/>
harder is it to figure out fact from fiction in a work<br/>
of fiction?<br/>

<h3>RE: [samuraihistory] Re: Top Ten Samurai Movies</h3>

<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1034745938">There are a zillion 47 Ronin films, many of them sub-titled in English. The<br/>
most familiar to English-speaking audiences is CHUSHINGURA, directed by<br/>
Inagaki. There are several others available on DVD from the "fan-subbers"<br/>
who have managed to get prints and been able to sub-title them. Being very<br/>
interested in the 47 Ronin event, I've collected quite a few of these.<br/>
 <br/>
The problem with most of the 47 Ronin films is the mythology in them. In<br/>
most of these films, the local Edo samurai and townspeople are shown to be<br/>
quite knowledgeable of the revenge and its planning, almost as if they have<br/>
formed "Ako Ronin Fan Clubs" to cheer them on. It seems, according to the<br/>
films, that everyone and his brother and sister throughout Japan just KNOW<br/>
exactly what the Ako ronin are planning. The problem with these sorts of<br/>
depictions is that, if all these folks in Edo knew exactly what was going<br/>
on, wouldn't Kira and his associates also know? And thus they would have<br/>
been able to easily thwart the revenge plans. <br/>
 <br/>
In fact, the planning and execution of the Ako ronin's revenge was carried<br/>
on in great secrecy. It was the only way that a sorely out-numbered handful<br/>
of ex-Ako retainers could achieve what they wanted to achieve. So they<br/>
deliberately set out on a course of action to make it appear that the LAST<br/>
thing on their minds would be a revenge. Oishi Kuranosuke was known to have<br/>
engaged in an extended pretense of dissipation, divorcing his wife and<br/>
getting drunk and disorderly at various Kyoto teahouses. The idea was to<br/>
lull Kira and his allies into thinking that the Ako ronin were a bunch of<br/>
ne'er do-wells who had no intention of avenging their lord. That way, they<br/>
could have the element of surprise on their side to successfully carry out<br/>
their attack. <br/>

<br/>
Thanks,<br/>
I have to agree on "Hara Kiri"  I just saw this the other night...the<br/>
Criterion version....great storyline, acting, and fantastic ending. <br/>
I'm somewhat an armor fan, and Kagemusha was great eye candy...also<br/>
really liked the hidden fortress...no one seems to have mentioned it<br/>
so far...<br/>
<br/>
I'm kind of suprised there is not an epic film based on the 47 Ronin,<br/>
especially since this event is so steeped in Samurai tradition and honor.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-785440131">At the risk of putting my foot in my mouth:<br/>
 <br/>
As for research, each person has to judge what is or what isn't accurate.<br/>
Sometimes we simply don't know. History books can be rife with inaccuracies,<br/>
no matter how many years the author may have studied in Japan or even if the<br/>
author is a native Japanese. Believe me, as an American, I've read plenty of<br/>
books on American history. If simply having the author being an American<br/>
were automatic proof of accuracy in historical research: I think that most<br/>
of the American people on this list know that there are scores of inaccurate<br/>
books written about the U.S. by native-born Americans. So the same with<br/>
Japanese history works or the works about the history of any country or<br/>
culture. <br/>
 <br/>
Individual movies, comics, etc. taken at face value would seem to be tenuous<br/>
sources of history. But sometimes a pattern can emerge from popular works<br/>
that can indicate some truths, or which at least, we can draw or speculate<br/>
on conclusions. So I don't think that movies, comics, etc. can be entirely<br/>
discounted either. <br/>
 <br/>
I'm a writer who is engaged in writing historical fiction that takes place<br/>
in Japan. I'm NOT a historian and would never claim to be so. I do depend on<br/>
various sources to research the background for my writings. I am unable to<br/>
read Japanese so I'm limited to translated works for my research. I find<br/>
that I have to consult several sources and then use my logic to decide upon<br/>
the reasonable accuracy of any of them. And also realize that my own works<br/>
are works of fiction, not definite statements on what actually has happened<br/>
in history. <br/>
 <br/>
In my short story "Stray Dogs, " I certainly cannot claim that this is a<br/>
proven, complete historical rendition of events in Fuwa Kazuemon's life.<br/>
That is because we simply don't know a whole lot about his life. He was a<br/>
ronin for the last 5-6 years of his life and there really weren't a whole<br/>
lot of historical records kept on the lives of ronin; most people of the<br/>
time considered them to be inconsequential. So in order to produce a<br/>
satisfactory work of fiction, I have to do my research on what is available<br/>
about his life. But then, I have to use my logic in researching the general<br/>
living conditions for ronin of that era, and put in my speculations as to<br/>
how Fuwa Kazuemon's life might have occurred within that context. <br/>
 <br/>
To try and sum up, in studying history, one must consult many sources. And<br/>
then use logic to decide the weight to be put on each source that is<br/>
consulted.<br/>
 <br/>
I don't know if any of this makes sense or is just ramblings.   <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-360555693">Miyamoto Musashi was most definitely a samurai. In his own book BOOK OF FIVE<br/>
RINGS, he listed his ancestry, and he most definitely qualified. <br/>
 <br/>
I've seen the "Samurai" series of movies (directed by Inagaki, starring<br/>
Mifune). One of the huge inaccuracies of this series is the idea that<br/>
Miyamoto Musashi started life out as a farmer and "became" a samurai. Not<br/>
true. Most of the sources that I have consulted about the life of Miyamoto<br/>
Musashi state that the details of his early life are sketchy. It seems that<br/>
he was born and grew up in a farming village. But he was the son of a ronin<br/>
who taught fencing in the village; he was not the son of a farmer. A ronin<br/>
wasn't connected with a clan and many times had little status in the scheme<br/>
of things. But still, he was a member of the bushi or samurai class. <br/>
 <br/>
Just my 2 mon here. If I'm wrong, feel free to correct me.<br/>

<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-706475046">Yeah, well there is also the prevailing and very mistaken idea that farmers<br/>
or tradesmen could "become samurai." As in the SAMURAI series of films,<br/>
which portray Miyamoto Musashi as coming from a farmer family and then being<br/>
"promoted" to the status of samurai. I just got through discussing this myth<br/>
in a post I just posted, so I won't repeat it here.<br/>
 <br/>
Yeah, the whole "black-robed ninja" thing. Arrrggghhh!!!  <gross eye<br/>
rollage><br/>
 <br/>
Back to the farmer/samurai thing, however. It is true that the distinctions<br/>
between the two classes were a bit more blurred before Hideyoshi's infamous<br/>
"sword hunt." Fumazawa Banzin (17th/18th century Japanese political<br/>
reformer), in some of his works, discusses an age of "farmer-soldiers" in<br/>
advocating that Japanese society be structured along these lines rather than<br/>
having the clear-cut distinction between farmers and samurai.   <br/>

 </span></blockquote>Nina, you're calling out my inner-skeptic. In his OWN<br/>
BOOK, you say? Shocking that he'd give himself a<br/>
samurai pedigree, oh my!<br/>
<br/>
Seriously, I don't know one way or the other--he may<br/>
have been, may not have been. I don't really care, as<br/>
I'm not a Musashiphile. Had he ever been on the<br/>
winning side in a battle, or led troops in combat, I'd<br/>
care--duelists aren't my "thing". [/rant] (sorry, I<br/>
just don't *get* Musashi...compelling character maybe,<br/>
but Tsukuhara Bokuden or Kamiizumi Nobutsuna, who<br/>
actually led samurai troops in addition to being great<br/>
duelists, are much more interesting, I think). <br/>
<br/>
I'm reminded, however, of Tokugawa Ieyasu's "lineage".<br/>
It's accepted as "fact" nowadays that the Tokugawa<br/>
were descended from the Minamoto, but in truth Ieyasu<br/>
had several family trees fabricated, claiming lineage<br/>
to the Fujiwara, Taira, Minamoto...to use as best fit<br/>
the situation. Turns out the best one that suited his<br/>
purposes was the Minamoto one, to strengthen a claim<br/>
at Shogun, so that's what we've got. <br/>
<br/>
Perhaps Musashi was being honest and was a samurai,<br/>
perhaps not. As you said, his early life is extremely<br/>
murky--I'll go with a "don't know" on this one. <br/>
<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-893314745">Hah, hah, I remember the scene in SEVEN SAMURAI where the farmer "Kikuchiyo"<br/>
(played by Mifune) has given himself a samurai pedigree. And one of the<br/>
other ronin in the group point out that he would have to have been born 100<br/>
or so years ago. <g><br/>
 <br/>
Musashi's early life is sketchy, so I drew my own conclusions, which may be<br/>
way off base. I didn't draw the conclusion purely on Musashi's outlining of<br/>
his own pedigree; I had other sources I consulted as well. According to<br/>
these sources, it has seemed logical to conclude that Miyamoto Musashi was<br/>
born the son of a ronin in a farming village. Like I said, I may be wrong,<br/>
but I feel more confident to say this rather than to say simply "I don't<br/>
know." <br/>

 </span></blockquote>Prior to the Class seperation edicts (Sword hunt, et<br/>
al) they COULD. During the vast bulk of the Sengoku,<br/>
Ashigaru  weren't considered "samurai"--they were<br/>
originally farmer-footsoldiers recruited from the<br/>
provinces to serve during campaigns, and then went<br/>
back to the fields when the battle was over. Only with<br/>
the professionalization of armies did they become the<br/>
lower ranks of the samurai class. Many ashigaru could<br/>
and did rise within the samurai structure--notably,<br/>
Hideyoshi. <br/>
<br/>
And that's not even mentioning the "jizamurai", the<br/>
landed gentry who farmed and warred, and were both<br/>
samurai and farmers (generally wealthy landowners). <br/>
<br/>
The problem with your statement is it's very much a<br/>
product of the tail end of the Sengoku and the Edo<br/>
period. Especially from the Onin on, anyone with the<br/>
right breaks and a set of iron...fists...could become<br/>
a samurai. Saito Dosan either was, or was the son of,<br/>
an oil seller, depending on which author you read. Ise<br/>
Shinkuro (later Hojo Soun) rises up practically from<br/>
out of nowhere. Most of Hideyoshi's close retainers<br/>
(Kato Kiyomasa, for example) came from the same Owari<br/>
peasant villages he did--in fact, it's celebrated in<br/>
Nagoya's Nakamura-ku, which used to be the village of<br/>
Nakamura, where Hideyoshi and Kiyomasa both were born.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Could status be bought, like in Shogun? Not<br/>
really--not that way. A rich farmer could possibly<br/>
have been adopted into an impoverished samurai family<br/>
and thereby "made" samurai, but I couldn't tell you if<br/>
I've ever come across that. It sounds too dramatic to<br/>
me. <br/>

he'd be too young. The date read off showed<br/>
"Kikuchiyo" to be 7, IIRC. <br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Fair enough--the commonly held idea is that he was a<br/>
ronin himself, and therefore samurai, but honestly, it<br/>
doesn't really matter. I just find it slightly ironic<br/>
that some hold him up as this "samurai paragon" (tm)<br/>
and yet there is some doubt about his origins, but in<br/>
the end, the importance of Musashi is in the stories<br/>
of his life and his art and writing, not his birth.<br/>

his wife. I won't say a lot more as I don't want to "spoil" it. It was made<br/>
in 1935 and directed by Yamanaka Sadao, who was drafted into WW2 shortly<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-2098846859">In my earlier post, at the end of it, I tried to make the distinction<br/>
concerning "before" and "after" Hideyoshi's Sword Hunt. Because before the<br/>
Sword Hunt, the distinction between farmers and samurai was blurred. In fact<br/>
Fumazawa Banzin refers to the period before the "sword hunt" in writing<br/>
about possible reforms; he believed that the country would be better off<br/>
adopting the "farmer-soldier" model that existed before the rigid separation<br/>
was made. <br/>
 <br/>
As for "buying" samurai status during the Edo period. This sometimes<br/>
happened, particularly near the end of the period. A merchant family could<br/>
offer their son to be married into a samurai family; the merchant son is<br/>
"adopted" as the heir in marrying the samurai family's daughter. <br/>
 <br/>
Some of Sakamoto Ryoma's ancestors acquired samurai status that way,<br/>
according to the biographies of his life that I've read.<br/>

Kurosawa's attention to detail. Watch it carefully. Heihachi, in the <br/>
BACKGROUND, begins counting on his fingers when the date is mentioned. <br/>
Then he gets a confused look on his face. When Kanbei says "Kikuchiyo" <br/>
must be thirteen, he's the first one who explodes with laughter.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-124954116">Actually, I really enjoyed these movies and I must admit I like Sansho, <br/>
the baillif at least as much as the 7 samurais.<br/>

I don't know so much "classical" japanese directors, or even about <br/>
Japanese movies but I think Mizoguchi has a very interesting style. <br/>
These two movies are very close to the characters which are not really <br/>
"heros" like in most well-known Kurosawa films (and of course <br/>
exploitation chambaras) but very "human" and in a way realistic <br/>
characters. They are making mistakes, they are struggling (not in a <br/>
martial way), they have their bad sides and good sides and thus are <br/>
truly interesting. Their doubts make them real.<br/>
The way Mizoguchi uses female characters in his movies is also very <br/>
interesting.<br/>

didn't convey what I wanted to with the "Shogun"<br/>
reference--in the book. Gyoko, the Mama-san, tries to<br/>
bargain with Toranaga to get her son "named" a<br/>
samurai. Not adopted, simply "granted" samurai<br/>
status--it didn't really work that way, as both of our<br/>

<h3>Re: Our &quot;welcoming&quot; attitude</h3>
by <i>onnagozen</i>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-933462370">Nina, it's clear that you know this film very well.  I also love this<br/>
film, and although it moved me deeply, I found myself questioning the<br/>
initial, strong reaction that it induced.<br/>
It seems that no matter how much research one conducts in order to get<br/>
to the "truth" of a matter, it's impossible to ever really know what<br/>
happened.  Each party will always have his or her own axe to grind and<br/>
will slant the information in a way to suit them.  It's also the case<br/>
that how we ourselves approach and view an event can often say more<br/>
about us and our backgrounds than the event itself.  So, in Seppuku we<br/>
have an event that is utterly abhorrent to us, as modern people.  Yet<br/>
taken in its own context it's almost impossible to see what else the<br/>
Ii clan could have done.  If they were to become caring,<br/>
compassionate, warm-hearted and empathetic, would they not more<br/>
closely resemble Mother Theresa than the very thing that fascinates us<br/>
so?  From a historical point of view, it's ludicrous to expect it;from<br/>
our own point of view, knowing the history of Japan in general and<br/>
samurai in particular, how could we possibly condemn the Ii clan out<br/>
of hand?    By the time the film was made there were no samurai, yet<br/>
it almost feels like the film-maker was making a propaganda movie<br/>
against the feudal era and its practices.  Perhaps it was a metaphor<br/>
for post-war Japan and the horrors of rebuilding the country.  I'm<br/>
guessing, but it makes more sense than trying to rewrite history,<br/>
because if you condemn the Ii clan, you have to condemn every other<br/>
clan.<br/>
<br/>
My personal view is that many of us who love samurai but are disturbed<br/>
by the tale of Seppuku are trying too hard to Disney-fy the samurai. <br/>
We like our good guys and bad guys to be easily identified, so when<br/>
the film maker leads us gently but very, very firmly by the hand to<br/>
reach the conclusion that he clearly wants us to make, we allow<br/>
ourselves to be led.  We condemn the Ii clan, not only because they<br/>
didn't care to ask Motome about his chosen course of action, but<br/>
because even when they found out his tragic story, they still didn't<br/>
care.  How heartless are they?  But then, how much heart can you<br/>
afford to have when the country has an epidemic of ronin and the<br/>
bakufu has no clear plan for them?  Presumably the Tokugawa desired<br/>
nothing more than that these ronin would take the honorable way out<br/>
and commit seppuku, without fuss.  This, to me, is far more cruel than<br/>
the little drama played out by both victims of the shogunate's lack of<br/>
humanity: the Ii Clan and Motome.  The Ii clan were forced into taking<br/>
actions it did not seek to take, and to deal with a country-wide<br/>
problem without guidance or funds to do so.  <br/>
<br/>
Seppuku is a superb film, even taken at face value.  However, when you<br/>
question it, analyse it and explore it - and your own reactions to it<br/>
- it becomes an absolute masterpiece for forcing you to keep your<br/>
knees from jerking where they were supposed to jerk.  By trying to<br/>
turn this film in a heroes and villains tearjerker the viewer can lose<br/>
the chance to delve a little deeper and get much more out of it.</div>

samurai, 99 times out of 100, had everything to do<br/>
with being born to parents of samurai birth, and<br/>
nothing else. <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-525448851">What made Miyamoto Musashi a samurai?<br/>
 <br/>
I think we've had some discussion before about this. It's an interesting<br/>
question.<br/>
 <br/>
Part of what made Miyamoto Musashi a samurai was his birth, his bloodlines.<br/>
He was born into a samurai family, though accounts of his early life are<br/>
vague. From what I can gather from reading these accounts, it seems likely<br/>
to me that he was born the son of a ronin who lived in a farming village.<br/>
 <br/>
But also, I believe that he was born before Hideyoshi's "sword hunt" and<br/>
thus the distinction between samurai and farmers wasn't as clear-cut as<br/>
after that time. The "sword hunt" did occur during Musashi's lifetime, I<br/>
believe, and he came out on the "samurai" end of that as far as I know. He<br/>
fought in the battle of Sekigahara on the losing side, so he definitely was<br/>
the 17th century equivilent of a "combat-veteran."<br/>
 <br/>
For most of Musashi's life, he was a ronin. He spent a bit of time in<br/>
service to (I believe it was) one of the Hosokawa daimyos and I believe that<br/>
he was involved in the summer siege of Osaka Castle. As far as I know, he<br/>
was always friendly to the Hosokawa Clan. But he wanted to study on his own,<br/>
not attached to a clan. As for how he made his living, this is vague, but<br/>
I've read that he sometimes taught fencing in itinerent fencing schools or<br/>
makeshift classes that he set up while on his travels. He never made more<br/>
than enough for him to live on; he was one of those stereotypical rough,<br/>
ragged ronin who was quite scary to many folk. He never married but did<br/>
adopt two sons.<br/>
 <br/>
Near the end of his life, he entered Lord Hosokawa's service and got<br/>
involved in advising him during the Shimabara battle. AFter that, he<br/>
retreated into a cave and wrote "Book of Five Rings." <br/>

Mushashi trained himself and also had many challenges<br/>
and teachers, but what actually made him a Samurai? He<br/>
did not hire his sword out as far as I know.<br/>

<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1742076600">My views: aside from what Takiguchi and Kobayashi may have been trying to<br/>
express as a social or political statement using a feudal metaphor: I think<br/>
that they also wanted to set up a character study. A story about some<br/>
individuals who reacted in certain ways to certain events that happened to<br/>
them. <br/>
 <br/>
Sometimes, as either historians or film buffs, we try to over-generalize as<br/>
to what "huge message" has been meant, what "politics" or "propaganda" might<br/>
be there, and what all of this means in a grand scheme of things. <br/>
 <br/>
Kobayashi has said that his films are about individuals (not groups or<br/>
political tendencies) who resist oppression. So in order to make a film<br/>
about such a theme, one must set up a particular individual with a<br/>
particular personality. With particular strengths and weaknesses of<br/>
character. <br/>
 <br/>
Even for someone who couldn't care less about Japanese (or American or<br/>
European or wherever) politics, either in ancient or modern times -- still<br/>
SEPPUKU is a chilling and compelling portrait of individuals and how they<br/>
deal with the fate meted out to them. <br/>
 <br/>
Now to reference actual history to this comment -- because this is a history<br/>
list and not a list about fictional literature or cinema. Do we study<br/>
history as grand themes and tendencies? Or study the lives of individuals?<br/>
Do we study just the lives of influential individuals (i.e.Nobunaga,<br/>
Hideyoshi, Tokugawa Ieyasu)? Or try and look at the lives of ordinary<br/>
people, in whatever ways we may? Or all of the above? <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-134304287">For me, all elements are fascinating and worthy of study.  I guess  the trick is never to see any particular version as being "gospel", because  although facts are incontrovertible, the ability to discern facts from slightly altered facts, from fiction, from propaganda (and disinformation) is way out of my field of expertise!  Looking at the story of just one of the 47 ronin, for example, compared to huge story of the Tokugawa shogunate, how could I insist that one episode is more important than another, or more interesting, or offers the world more in either sociological education or simple entertainment?  Personally, I love all of it, although some eras fascinate me more than others. I think it's important to see chambara films for what they are: magnificent pieces of entertainment about fascinating periods in history, tempered by the personal opinions and experiences of the writers and directors.  If we do that, though, shouldn't we also do the same for a great deal of accepted history which may have been written by one or other side's faction?  Is it so important to "know" something for an absolute certainty, or is it better to FEEl somthing for a pretty close bet?<br/>

history of Japan.  What was thier real purpose in this.  <br/>
<br/>
  Just wondering did Tosugawa want to be shogun for the good of Japan to <br/>
unifiy it or did he want to become Shogun for some ohter reason.   and once he was <br/>
in power was Japan better off then it was before this period.   <br/>

It helps if you leave part of the original message in<br/>

relevant text, like this. As it stands, I don't know<br/>
what post you are replying to--lots of people have<br/>

is Nina, since she gave a detailed set of info, but it<br/>

 </span></blockquote>The reality is, we really don't have a clear picture of what went on <br/>
during the Sengoku period. It is a collection of letters, history <br/>
written by the victors, history written 100 years after the fact, <br/>
and conjecture.  I read an article about a year ago that talked <br/>
about a family who had family documents for a prominent Samurai <br/>
family of the Sengoku who finally released it to scholars about 9 <br/>
years ago, and it turned out that a lot of what was thought to be <br/>
correct history of that clan was actually incorrect. Also, there <br/>
were tons of documents destroyed by US bombing raids of temples that <br/>
were never examined, and even today there are decendants of samurai <br/>
families who have historical documents who refuse to release them to <br/>
scholars because it is thier own "family matters".  So there were <br/>
potentially a lot of historical revelations destroyed during WWII, <br/>
and historical documents that exist but are inaccessible to <br/>
scholars.  When you think about it, some of what happened in the <br/>
Sengoku is both so epic and fortuituous, the only real explanation <br/>
has to be that there was more to the event(s) than what the <br/>
documents currently tell us.  Too many people died of "illness" at <br/>
perfect times for opportunists, and too many miraculous turnings of <br/>
the tides of war happened for me to believe that we have the 'whole' <br/>
story.</div>

<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-2059831093">i read a lot of the discussion on the forum and people who are looking <br/>
for correct information about japanese history.<br/>
i have to tell you that you will not find it in books especially not <br/>
in western written books.<br/>
find one translated from a japanese author and i know you will find <br/>
allready some big misinturpentations.<br/>
to gather the real story you will have to take out the facts of all <br/>
books and check those.<br/>
the more facts you gather the more the real story will be clear to you.<br/>
for me it is very easy to verify anything i read because i am married <br/>
to an japanese lady who have studied japanese history and came forward <br/>
out of a pre-war mixed marriage between an noble class person and a <br/>
samurai person, for you to know the matsumoto family.<br/>
the matsumoto are famous for their black castle in shinano.<br/>
i discovered in this way the many small mistakes people make analysing <br/>
the japanese history.<br/>
<br/>
the total discussion about mushasi on this forum as an example.<br/>
<br/>
he was a samurai out of bloodline(maybe hard to understand for <br/>
americans who do not have a feudal history) and tried to be the <br/>
swordsmaster of japan.<br/>
swordsmaster in japan in those days meant you where the swords teacher <br/>
of the shogun.<br/>
becomes he came out of the loosing camp at sekigahara-war his skills <br/>
were less important to the ruling clans then his background.<br/>
the ruling clans made sure that such a high position came only aviable <br/>
to one of the clans ruling.<br/>
even if the shogun wanted him as swordmaster it would give him a lot <br/>

 </span></blockquote>When I'm at home, I have AOL; they actually make this quite easy. What you <br/>
have to do is highlight the part of the message you want to be copied for you to <br/>
reply to. then you hit the "reply" button and you'll get a format like this <br/>
above.<br/>
<br/>
It's the folks using Outlook -- such as what I use at work -- where I have to <br/>
be careful about "topping" posts. Because Outlook automatically puts the post <br/>
that you are responding to at the bottom. And they include the entire post as <br/>
a default. And thus you have to back into it and delete the parts that are <br/>
irrelevant to your response. <br/>
<br/>
Also, I'm going to have to investigate a way in Outlook to put the post on <br/>
the top and put my response below it. Didn't know that this was an issue in <br/>
itself, but if it is, I can deal with it; it can be done with cut-and-paste.<br/>
<br/>
Hope this helps, Nina</div>

 </span></blockquote>Check your preferences. There should be a way to reset that so the <br/>
quoted material is on top.<br/>
<br/>
That setting of top-posting as "default" is another of Outlook's evil <br/>
features. IE is the same way.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>I'll check it. And perhaps others using Outlook might have some imput into <br/>
this discussion. But if you have to do a manual "cut and paste" in order to <br/>
switch around the order of the post, I don't really see how this is such a huge <br/>
issue. But if it is, then it can be done.<br/>
<br/>
And actually, many using Outlook like the original way it is set up. <br/>
Especially when using Outlook for business purposes, the preferred format is to have <br/>
the original post on the bottom and the response on the top. So either the <br/>
Outlook people have to do the cut-and-paste method. Or else, assuming that it's <br/>
possible to reset the preferences as to format, they would have to constantly <br/>
switch back and forth in preferences so that they can conduct their other <br/>
email-related business. <br/>
<br/>
So let me pose this question in the hopes of coming to a good compromise or <br/>
at least a definite answer: if the people using Outlook and other email systems <br/>
that are mainly formatted for business -- if they delete from the post they <br/>
respond to, other than the relevant passages. But leave it at the bottom rather <br/>
than cut-and-paste to put it on the top. Would that be acceptable? Or are you <br/>
saying that the part being responded to MUST be on the top and the response <br/>
MUST be on the bottom.<br/>
<br/>

As a moderator, let me respond--no, it's not a MUST.<br/>
Kitsuno and I DO ask that people delete irrelevant<br/>
comments from the post they are replying to, and but<br/>
keep something of the post (preferably, the part you<br/>
ARE commenting on) so that we all know what the heck<br/>
you are talking about. <br/>
<br/>
However, bottom-posting is more natural for<br/>
comprehension. There are comments, then a response.<br/>
Response and then comments responded to just doesn't<br/>
make sense. It's not that hard to scroll down--I did,<br/>
as Yahoo Mail puts me in position to post at the top,<br/>
also. Just scroll down and type at the bottom of the<br/>
post. A MUST? No. But it just makes sense. <br/>

 </span></blockquote>Basicaly, bottom posting is the standard on these groups, and deleting <br/>
parts of the post that don't apply to one's response is also good <br/>
etiquette, considerate, and makes it much easier to follow. As far as <br/>
I'm concerned, top post or bottom post - do whatcha like - just MAKE <br/>
SURE you leave the paragraph(s) you are replying to, and MAKE SURE to <br/>
delete extraneous stuff that isn't addressed, doesn't matter, or is <br/>
just clutter.</div>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>By the way, I use outlook sometimes - all you have to do is <br/>
hit "reply", then when you get to the email you can respond to, just <br/>
*SIMPLY* scroll to the bottom, and start typing. (of course first <br/>
delete the extra stuff you don't need.  Just because the cursor <br/>
defaults to the top of the screen doesn't mean you can't just scroll <br/>
to the bottom of all the ">>" marked lines, and start typing there. <br/>
Microsoft may be hated by the tech-savvy, but it is EASY to use.  <br/>
There is NO NEED for any cutting and pasting.  Again, top post or <br/>
bottom post, but just please everyone, let's leave the relevant info <br/>
from the prior post, and delete the irrelevant.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks!  :D</div>
