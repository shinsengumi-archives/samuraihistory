 </span></blockquote>Don't know of any Japanese movies. Your best bet is<br/>
probably Korean movies--a bit more traumatic for them. <br/>

As I know that you already read an English version of<br/>
'book of correction' by Yu who was a prime minister<br/>
then, I am wondering what drew your attention to the<br/>
Japanese crossing of the Imjin river.  <br/>
The commander in chief of the Chosun Dynasty was not<br/>
competent, who should have held such a high military<br/>
command, only thinking about running away. There was<br/>
no significant milarty event worthy of a record except<br/>
for one incidence when a low rank officer of Chosun<br/>
dynasty scrared off some Japanese soldiers who shot<br/>
muskets for fun by shooting several arrows across the<br/>
river.<br/>
I also don't remember seeing any movies on the Imjin<br/>
crossing although I was in Korea only until 1998.<br/>

<br/>
    I often get fascinated by obscure periods of history and start to <br/>
research them.<br/>
<br/>
    I got interested in the Imjin War (which is what I've read is the <br/>
Japanese name for the invasion of Korea in the 1590s) because of two things.  One is <br/>
the availabilty of 15mm Korean cavalry and infantry figures from Eureka <br/>
miniatures in Australia.  <br/>
<br/>
    The other is a seven part series on the Korean army by Rob Morgan which <br/>
was published in the Arquebusier (a British journal dedicated to the <br/>
Renaissance period).<br/>
<br/>
    I have collected a list of references on the Imjin War, which is below.  <br/>
I actually need to add to it, which I will do over the holidays and then I'll <br/>
post them to the group's archives.<br/>
<br/>
    I did find a reference on the Internet to an upcoming Korean movie about <br/>
the Japanese invasion.  Here is what the blurb said:<br/>
<br/>
"SOLDIERS OF HEAVEN. ("Cheon-gun") A group of soldiers from North and South<br/>
<br/>
Korea are caught in a timewarp and swept back to 1592 and find themselves in<br/>
<br/>
the middle of the Imjin War. The cast includes Park Jung-hoon, Kim<br/>
<br/>
Seung-woo, Hwang Jeong-min and Kong Hyo-jin. The production company, Sidus,<br/>
<br/>
has budgeted around 8 million dollars on this project which will be filmed<br/>
<br/>
by new director Min Jun-gi. Filming began on July 20 and there is an<br/>
<br/>
estimated release sometime in April 2005."<br/>
<br/>
    I just hope it gets released with English subtitles.  If it shows a lot <br/>
of Korean soldiers I could use it as a painting guide for when I finally buy my <br/>
Korean army.<br/>
<br/>
    If you know of any other references in English about this war, please let <br/>
me know.<br/>
I'm especially interested in finding colour illustrations of Korean troops.<br/>
<br/>
    I've listed a booklet by the Korean Defense Department below that I would <br/>
especially like to get a copy of.<br/>

<br/>
    This article focuses on the battle that marked the turning point in the <br/>
Japanese invasion of Korea, which lasted from 1592-1598. Up to this point the <br/>
outgunned Korean defenders had suffered defeat after defeat and been forced to <br/>
abandon all of Korea’s major cities and fortresses and seek refuge along the <br/>
Chinese border. They requested help from Ming China, Korea’s tributary <br/>
overlords and even though a small Ming expeditionary force was defeated in the summer <br/>
of 1592, the Ming promised to send more aid. This arrived in early 1593 and <br/>
together with Korean troops and volunteers, the Ming overwhelmed the Japanese <br/>
with superior firepower and recovered the city of Pyongyang, Korea’s auxiliary <br/>
capital. Within months Seoul was also recovered and the Japanese never regained <br/>
their early momentum.<br/>
