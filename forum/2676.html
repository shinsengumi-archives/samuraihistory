<h3>New Member Arrival</h3>
by <i>kyosuke_miyamoto</i>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1061560405">Hello Everyone, Im Kyosuke. I'm new to the forum and all, but I know <br/>
a great lot about samurai, weapons, and ancient japan. I myself, <br/>
follow the Bushido, so you could say I am a real life Samurai, though <br/>
Samurai's have been outlawed since the late 1800's, I still consider <br/>
myself one. I've been to Japan, and studied the fighting skills from <br/>
Sensei Ichi Hayamatsu, learned the old culture and the respects. And <br/>
with this, I've become a Samurai. I want to be the one to say how Im <br/>
honored in joining this forum, and expect a lot of great stuff from <br/>
you all as well. <br/>
<br/>
That is all.<br/>
-Kyosuke Miyamoto<br/>
<br/>
P.S. Im also A fanatic of old Samurai Movies. If you'd like we can <br/>
talk of them.</div>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1849966426">listen, by saying you're a samurai you've just given<br/>
most of us a HUGE headache.<br/>
You DO know that the Bushido was an invention of the<br/>
Edo era to keep samurai in line and give them a<br/>
purpose in society? that the only people who EVER used<br/>
bushido in combat were the Shinsen gumi, and that it<br/>
showed a marvelous FAILURE? No, by following the<br/>
Bushido you are NOT a samurai, you are a<br/>
dissillusioned individual.<br/>
The samurai were not "outlawed" as some people like to<br/>
believe, they had their status removed. Which means<br/>
that if you were a samurai before the bakumatsu, you<br/>
were NOT still a samurai in the Meiji era. The only<br/>
possible exception might be Saigo Takamori and the<br/>
Satsuma Rebellion. Listen, no one today is a samurai.<br/>
And its really sad to think of yourself as one just<br/>
because you follow a code of ethics from the lowest<br/>
period in the history of the samurai.<br/>
That being said it is great that you follow martial<br/>
arts, I do so myself. And I'd be interested in hearing<br/>
what all you have to know about the historical<br/>
samurai.<br/>

"Some Samurai followed Bushido, but Bushido was not followed by all <br/>
Samurai.  You follow Bushido.  That does not make you a Samurai."<br/>
<br/>
We'll even ignore the fact that 'Samurai' was a social class, and <br/>
not a product of Bushido, but Bushido was a product of a few Samurai <br/>
with nothing better to do than justify their lecherous existence <br/>
during the Edo period, and then gathered a following because it made <br/>
them look honorable and useful.<br/>
<br/>
I'm surprised that you think this way if you've been to Japan, as <br/>
you should know that any remnants of bushido are long, long gone in <br/>
that society, and I Gaijin attempting to play Samurai would be <br/>
thought a moron at best.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-183266265">Hey Angry Lllama<br/>
<br/>
That is true what you said about the hagakure being a rather late development (1716), but I <br/>
figure Yamamoto Tsunetomo was "standing on the shoulders" of those who went before him. <br/>
To say that there was no bushido before 1716... is it really fair to claim that? Just because it <br/>
wasn't written down? Sure, it may have varied from region to region and era to era, but the <br/>
samurai as a caste surely had a set of expectations or ethics - whether self-imposed or <br/>
imposed by others. If I'm way off base, let me know. Related to this, I'd like to know: is there <br/>
any evidence for "bushido" prior to the Hagakure? What are the other main pieces of samurai <br/>
literature?<br/>
<br/>
Thanks.</div>

lord, no incredible loyalty to death, none of that<br/>
stuff. there were very brave samurai, and some very,<br/>
very smart leaders, but nothing quite like the<br/>
hagakure expounds, and they were still generally in<br/>
the minority. the fighting samurai were really not all<br/>
that different from fighters around the world... they<br/>
were in for reward and wanted to live. the thing that<br/>
fascinates me the most about the samurai was their<br/>
intelligence and adaptability; take the gun, for<br/>
example. after the portuguese introduced it, the<br/>
japanese immediatly improved upon it, and began using<br/>
tactics more advanced than the very europeans who had<br/>
invented it.<br/>

    Welcome to the group.  I have a question about samurai movies.  Have <br/>
there been any movies made about the Satsuma Rebellion of 1877?<br/>
<br/>
    I just saw "The Last Samurai" today and I enjoyed it very much, despite <br/>
the historical liberties that were taken.  But I was wondering if anyone in <br/>
Japan has made a more historically accurate movie about that period?<br/>

follow the Bushido, so you could say I am a real life Samurai, though <br/>

Samurai's have been outlawed since the late 1800's, I still consider <br/>

myself one. I've been to Japan, and studied the fighting skills from <br/>

<br/>
with this, I've become a Samurai. I want to be the one to say how Im <br/>

that have been made. I think next year's NHK Taiga drama is a Meiji <br/>

	Look for the film "Bushido Blade", which has at least as many <br/>
screamers in it but to me was more entertaining and more accurate. As <br/>
for Japanese films, they tend to focus on individuals. Films about <br/>
Sakamoto Ryoma being in the majority,'Ronin' I think is one of them. <br/>
Also look for the film Bakumatsu(The Ambitious). In the area of Taiga <br/>

drama and where could I rent the one about Saigo Takamori?  Is there any <br/>

<br/>
There was a 50-part Japanese TV show that was shown on the San Francisco <br/>
Asian station several years ago.  It was called TOBU GA GOTUKU and was about the <br/>
Meji Restoration and went up through the Satsuma Rebellion.  Fortunately, I <br/>
learned about it somewhere around episode 32.  I was able to watch the episodes <br/>
on the Satsuma Rebellion.  Thank God they had English subtitles.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1715564045">Taiga Drama is a year long historical drama (about 49 episodes; used to be<br/>
50) that airs from January to December. It started in 1963. Most of the<br/>
dramas take place in the sengoku or bakumatsu period. They usually have the<br/>
biggest stars in Japan. This years which just finished here in Japan was<br/>
Musashi, next years will be Shinsengumi. A condensed version is often shown<br/>
at the end of the year, and this it was is available on video and DVD (Tobu<br/>
Ga Gotuku is one of them). the only full length one I have seen released is<br/>
1983s Tokugawa Ieyasu. The ones available here are of course without<br/>
subtitles.<br/>
<br/>
Another miniseries about Saigo Takamori is Takarazaka with Satomi Kotaro.<br/>
Its about 4hrs long and is on Video. Its also shown frequently on cable. The<br/>
Family Channel here in Japan will repeat it as well as some other recent<br/>
jidai geki over the shogatsu holidays.</div>

<br/>
I don't want to sound too unhelpful here, but a lot of<br/>
us have been on this board and studying samurai<br/>
history for a long time. PLEASE don't come here, all<br/>
you newbie Last Samurai types, and expect <br/>
<br/>
a. that the movie is the be all end all of Samurai<br/>
history.<br/>
<br/>
b. That you can talk intelligently without ever<br/>
picking up a book. <br/>
<br/>
c. that everyone else on here has the same ideas about<br/>
becoming samurai/whatever. Several people on here are<br/>
published authors on the subject--if they tell you<br/>
you're wrong, you are. Take it like men. <br/>
<br/>
Now, about books, there is an extensive bibliography<br/>
on the www.samurai-archives.com website. Go there,<br/>
look at it, and start reading. If we have to explain<br/>
the whole history of the samurai every time someone<br/>
new asks, we'll never do anything but that. Again, I'm<br/>
not trying to be unhelpful--the most helpful thing I<br/>
can do is tell you to start reading! It will save us<br/>
all heartache and acrimony if you even just look at<br/>
the website first, rather than charging in here with<br/>
notions that Hollywood is History. <br/>
<br/>
Read the website, get some books at the library, read<br/>
the discussion board...<br/>
<br/>
Thanks,<br/>
<br/>

<h3>Taiga Drama Videos (was:Re: [samuraihistory] New Member Arrival)</h3>
by <i>cepooooo</i>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-415313824">There are actually Japanese video-stores in the US that carry the whole <br/>
collections. I have saw them in LA, and even here, our 'Nippon Video' <br/>
in Honolulu have many. They carry Japanese versions, non subtitled, and <br/>
the quality is often so-so, because they use very cheap quality tapes, <br/>
and probably make copies of copies of copies of copies.<br/>
However, I have bought 'Matsu to Toshiie,' (25 tapes!!!) and I actually <br/>
like it. They usually cost $3 to 5 per VHs, and every VHS carries 2 <br/>
episodes (and some commercial!!!).<br/>
If anybody needs a certain series, I might go after Christmas and see <br/>
if they have it. Usually they carry only recent stuff, thou, say from <br/>
the last 3-4 years. They have a few mini-series as well, and quite a <br/>
few old samurai videos (illegal copies, of course, made from original <br/>
Japanese videotapes they sell for an exorbitant $20 each!!).<br/>
What I dream to do one day, is to buy a DVD-R and put the whole stuff <br/>
on DVD. Then it would be much easier to preserve the quality and to <br/>
share.<br/>
<br/>
One question: does anybody have a 'chronology' of the Taiga drama?? <br/>
What was shown on a certain year and so on...?<br/>
