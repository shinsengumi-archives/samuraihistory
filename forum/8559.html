<h3>R: [samuraihistory] Bonsai and samurai</h3>
by <i>Carlo Tacchini</i>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1590437138">Tony is right. Peasants started the fashion of Bonsai, imported from<br/>
China.<br/>
They collected the most interesting trees from mountains (they are<br/>
called Yamadori, even today). Trees that were forged by nature in a<br/>
dwarfed and dramatical manner.<br/>
Somebody was so poor to cultivate them into great shells. When Samurai<br/>
were no more fighters, in Edojidai, Bonsai becomes another way to pass<br/>
the time. Can't be excluded that even before some Samurai was a<br/>
bonsaist, but Buke class wasn't really interested in growing little<br/>
trees, originally.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-2020625463">In a book about Bonsai I have read, says that Buda<br/>
past away close to a tree.   Then this tree became a<br/>
holy please where budisth go to prey.<br/>
When the chinese emperor became budisth and here about<br/>
the famous holy tree, it rise a mayor problem since he<br/>
can not leave the prohibited city.<br/>
And this gave birth to the Bonsai.<br/>
As time run by, this art went to Japan with the<br/>
budisth monks and it was an aristocrathic japanese who<br/>
saw a bonsai and converted it as an ornamental<br/>
instrument.<br/>
In Japan, a Bonsai is a reminder of Nature.<br/>
Here in occident, we tend to think in the little tree<br/>
on a pot; but in Japan Bonsai are also planted on<br/>
gardens.<br/>
<br/>
As per Samurai and Bonsai, I do not know about it.<br/>
Perhaps it was used as a martial art ( as Cha no yu<br/>
and calligraphy, since it trained one mind and one<br/>
hand ).   Or just as a hobby...   <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-683924909">In The World in Miniature: Container Gardens and Dwellings in Far <br/>
Eastern Religious Thought (Stanford UP 1990) the author, Rolf A Stein, <br/>
supports the view that bonsai began as a religious practice in temples <br/>
and monasteries. The practice has been found through East and South <br/>
East Asia since ancient times. He gives two anecdotes relating the <br/>
introduction of container gardens into Japan: in one the Empress Suiko <br/>
(593-628) received from the land of Kudara (Korea) a representation of <br/>
a holy mountain. A natural stone surrounded by white sand was placed <br/>
in a bowl (hachi) which in turn was placed in a large dish. It was <br/>
decorated with climbing plants and called a katsura-hachi. The next <br/>
stage introduced stones. Prince Shotoku (572 621) gave a dish (bon) in <br/>
which he had set up a landscape with mountains and villages, <br/>
fashioned from stones, to the Emperor who was sick at the time. This <br/>
was called a katsura-bon.  (Whether the Emperor recovered on <br/>
receiving this gift is not related by Stein.)<br/>
<br/>
In Chinese paintings tray gardens with miniature trees are often <br/>
portrayed. The earliest examples in Japanese painting come from the <br/>
14th century (Stein is quoting Yanagisawa's 1962 work Tray <br/>
Landscapes). Tray gardens and bonsai it seems were imbued with the <br/>
same sense of philosophy as painting, calligraphy and poetry.  <br/>
Peasants may have kept small gardens in pots and collected interesting <br/>
trees from the mountain (though I think yamadori means mountain <br/>
bird rather than mountain tree, doesn't it?) as this is a natural human <br/>
activity, but I would think the art of bonsai was more the pursuit of <br/>
monks, men of letters and artists. Gardening was a highly cultured <br/>
activity. The gardens held to have been designed by Sesshu in <br/>
Yamaguchi were considered works of art at the time of their creation. <br/>
Interestingly, they are also "in miniature" - representing full scale <br/>
landscapes just as bonsai do, but on a slightly larger scale.<br/>
<br/>
Hideyoshi himself was interested in planning gardens (was this his <br/>
peasant ancestry :)) supervising the layout of his pleasure garden, <br/>
Samboin.<br/>

<h3>RE: [samuraihistory] Bonsai and samurai</h3>
by <i>samurai_iaijutsu</i>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1919992164">Thanks.<br/>
<br/>
I found this too on internet (http://www.bonsaicenter.com) I don't know if<br/>
it's reliable or not. I hope the experts in this group can answer this.<br/>
<br/>
Bonsai History<br/>
<br/>
The art of bonsai was developed in the Far East where it is considered an<br/>
expression of the harmony between heaven and earth, man and nature. Its'<br/>
spiritual foundations lie in the Eastern philosophy of life which strives<br/>
after harmony between man and nature - a harmony which becomes apparent when<br/>
empathy is achieved with the process of all growth and development. There<br/>
could surely be no more fitting example of this than the cultivation of<br/>
bonsai.<br/>
<br/>
The bonsai lover will take time to care for and examine his trees. Through<br/>
them he experiences a new rhythm of the seasons, and nurtures within himself<br/>
the power of creativity as he shapes and miniaturizes his trees. Cultivating<br/>
a bonsai tree requires some care and attention, but as a reward it brings<br/>
tranquility to the mind, a feeling of being refreshed and, inner peace.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
The Chinese were the first to plant miniature trees in dishes, and even<br/>
today bonsai is part of Chinese culture. It has a place in every Chinese<br/>
community, even outside China itself, in places like Taiwan, Thailand, Hong<br/>
Kong and Singapore. Chinese bonsai masters of today still make a distinction<br/>
between 'pun-sai' and 'pun-ching'. For many the word 'pen-jing' is taken to<br/>
mean both forms of bonsai. <br/>
<br/>
The word 'pun-sai' is made up of the same characters as the Japanese word<br/>
'bonsai', and means a tree planted in a container without any landscape,<br/>
while 'pun-ching' means a tree that is planted in a container or on a tray<br/>
and landscaped. The art of pun-ching dates far back to the early period of<br/>
the Han dynasty, about 206 BC-AD 220, when Chinese landscape artists started<br/>
to design miniature versions of the already famous artificial rock gardens.<br/>
According to legend, Jiang-feng was endowed with a magic power to conjure up<br/>
on a dish tiny landscapes complete with rocks, mountains, trees, rivers,<br/>
houses, people and animals. At about the same time as the mention of<br/>
pun-ching, or miniature landscapes with rocks and trees, a form still very<br/>
popular in China today, we find the first reference to pun-sai during the<br/>
Ch'in dynasty (221-206 BC): it was Ton Guen-ming; a famous poet and high-<br/>
ranking official, who, having grown weary of affairs of state, retired to a<br/>
peaceful country living where he began to cultivate chrysanthemums in pots.<br/>
This may have been the beginning of potted plants, but it was to lead on to<br/>
the miniaturization of trees. Just 200 years later in paintings from the<br/>
T'ang period we find pines, cypresses, plum trees, and bamboos-all growing<br/>
in dishes. Even before the year AD 1000, in the Sung dynasty, there are<br/>
poems describing pun-sai as well as a wealth of literature on how to form<br/>
them.<br/>
<br/>
During the period of peace known as the Ch'ing dynasty (AD 1644-1911) both<br/>
pun-ching and pun-sai became a hobby not only of the aristocracy but of all<br/>
strata of Chinese society.  It was not the Chinese who introduced the art of<br/>
bonsai to the West; it was the Japanese, first in Paris at the Worlds Fair<br/>
of 1878, and subsequently in London in 1909.  It is believed that Buddhist<br/>
monks took bonsai to Japan in the tenth and eleventh centuries, as they<br/>
considered them to be religious objects, 'verdant stair ways leading to<br/>
Heaven', thus a connection between God and mankind.<br/>
<br/>
During the Yuan dynasty (AD 1280-1368) Japanese government ministers and<br/>
merchants brought home bonsai as presents from China .  Chu Shun-sui, a<br/>
Chinese official, who, around 1644, fled from the rule of the Manchu's to<br/>
Japan, taking with him his entire collection of bonsai literature. It was<br/>
his special  knowledge that contributed decisively to the spread of the art<br/>
of bonsai in Japan. Around this time Japan was beginning to establish its<br/>
own form of bonsai cultivation, an art which was at first the preserve of<br/>
the Japanese aristocracy, the Samurai, and which only at the end of the last<br/>
century became a hobby for all.<br/>

<h3>Re: [samuraihistory] Bonsai and samurai</h3>
by <i>drnostrand</i>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-880112062">Hi.<br/>
<br/>
Bonsai cultivation is a garden hobby. Why should there be a particular <br/>
history relating to samurai? Basically, if you could afford to <br/>
cultivate bonsai and liked them, then you did so. Miniatures of various <br/>
sort show up in things like the Confessions of Lady Nijo and The <br/>
Gossamer Years. Miniature trees fit right in with this stuff. It is <br/>
possible that miniature trees were taken up by the bushi as a way of <br/>
doing something similar to the kuge without being left behind by them. <br/>
So for example, the bushi took up the tea ceremony which in some ways <br/>
paralleled the incense ceremony and took up Noh theatre which in some <br/>
ways paralleled gagaku, bugaku, and kagura. However, I do not know just <br/>
how far back bonsai cultivation goes. If it goes back to the kuge, then <br/>
the bushi simply took it up from them in much the same way that they <br/>
took up the leisure clothes of the kuge.</div>
