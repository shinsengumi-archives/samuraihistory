<div id="ygrps-yiv-1293892119">For anyone interested, I have a lot of depictions of Samurai, though only<br/>
one is specifically an actual known historical figure (Benkei) on my web<br/>
site. The URL is <br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.hinesfamily.org/sharon">http://www.hinesfamily.org/sharon</a><br/>
<br/>
Also. We are now offering these as note cards, as of this week. I would<br/>
be very pleased to get e mails from anyone, letting me know how they<br/>
liked (or disliked) them. <br/>
<br/>
Benkei and Urashima no Taro are just two of my favorite old folk tales,<br/>
but it was fun to add my own illustrations to the many others that were<br/>
done by artists, through out history. :-)<br/>
<br/>
Enjoy.<br/>
<br/>
sincerely,<br/>
Sharon Hayakawa<br/>
