<h3>Akechi Mitsuhide</h3>
by <i>shogun2k2002</i>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1863790555">Question: I seem to recall reading from one source that the reason Mitsuhide <br/>
slew Nobunaga is that while Nobunaga was besieging a castle he decided to <br/>
burn it down. From what I remember, Mitsuhide's mother was inside and while <br/>
Nobunaga knew this he still set the castle on fire.<br/>
Problem is I cannot find the source that I read this from. Does anyone know <br/>
if this is indeed what happened?<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1183680743">Those more knowledgeable on this board will probably<br/>
have more information, but the information you cited<br/>
is incorrect. Nobunaga I believe had signed a truce<br/>
with the Bessho family in Harima, and as was customary<br/>
each side sent hostages (hitojichi?). Bessho Nagaharu<br/>
was sent to Nobunaga, and Nobunaga sent Akechi<br/>
Mitsuhide's mother. Some time later Nobunaga decided<br/>
to go back on this truce and killed Nagaharu. The<br/>
obvious response for the Bessho was to kill<br/>
Mitsuhide's mother. <br/>
<br/>
Additionally, Mitsuhide suffered several humiliations<br/>
at the hands of Nobunaga, who seemed to enjoy<br/>
"screwing with him." noted incidents include his<br/>
firing of Mitsuhide as the organizer of one of<br/>
Nobunaga's big wig parties in Kyoto in 1582, shortly<br/>
before his betrayal. <br/>
<br/>
Hope this helps.<br/>
