<h3>Re: Musashi</h3>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-592742373">I'm very very glad to hear that my site: 'Musashi, the man behind the<br/>
legend' has a success.<br/>
What inspired me in order to make a huge research on Musashi was Kinnosuke<br/>
Yorozuya's film series: 'The man of five rings'. An amazing film about<br/>
Musashi's life after his contest with Kojiro. Yorozuya as Musashi is superb<br/>
and later I heard that he was a master of kenjutsu (6th dan).<br/>
<br/>
For long time now, I'm trying hard to find more infos about Yorozuya.<br/>
However, it is impossible so far. It is said that Japanese 'hide' many<br/>
evidence because they want to keep them only for... them. I dunno if this is<br/>
true. But I know that there are for sure many files which have been left<br/>
without english translation...<br/>
<br/>
Please, if you know more about Yorozuya, feel free to let me know.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks for your interest on Musashi's site.<br/>
<br/>
Soon, I'll publish a book on Musashi based on this site.<br/>
<br/>
regards,<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-545989349">Yoshikawas's novel is a great story but has nothing to do with the true<br/>
story of Musashi.<br/>
Go to:<br/>

There is a bios of Musashi.<br/>
