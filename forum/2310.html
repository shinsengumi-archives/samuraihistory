<div id="ygrps-yiv-1216243768">Hi, I hope that my little input may give some good<br/>
direction to this discussion. <br/>
The Japanese fondness on the swordmanship through 16<br/>
and 17 century led to a branch of metal smith, which<br/>
could easily adapt into manufaturing arquebus once<br/>
they learned of it from the westerners. However, the<br/>
steel making process often adopted in the manufacture<br/>
of the cannons were more popularly used in China and<br/>
Korea.<br/>
That is why the major firearms for China and Korea<br/>
during this period was cannons instead of arquebus<br/>
unlike Japan.<br/>
<br/>
However, Machurians who conqured Myung Dynasty used<br/>
archery against the firearms of China and proved that<br/>
their archery was superior weaponary than the use of<br/>
firearms. This is one of reasons why the last Chinese<br/>
empire(Manchurian's) did not show much interest in the<br/>
western weaponary.<br/>
<br/>
As for Korea, their major weaponary was archery same<br/>
as that of Manchurians, which proved to be effective<br/>
in fighting the well trained Japanane soldiers until<br/>
Japanese adopted arquebus and used it during their<br/>
Korean invasion of the 16th(?) century. But, like<br/>
their continental neighbor, Koreans were also better<br/>
in manufacturing  cannons rather than arquebus due to<br/>
their peculiar steel making process. The heavy and<br/>
efficient use of cannons especially by Korean Navy was<br/>
one of factors that made Japanese decide to withdraw<br/>
from the Korean peninsula.<br/>
<br/>
Lastly, there is a recent English translation on the<br/>
book on the Japanese invasion of the Korea written by<br/>
the then Korean (royal court) prime minister, who was<br/>
a famous theoretical confucianist and well versed in<br/>
the military strategy during that time. I remember it<br/>
was published throught the grant offered by either UC<br/>
Berkeley or Stanford (not sure, but some well standing<br/>
university in the west coast). You might like to look<br/>
for the book if you are interested. For the specific<br/>
information on the book, you can try www.chosun.com,<br/>
which is the website of the Korean(largetst) daily<br/>
newspaper. I hope that this will help.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
                          Sincerely,<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>

I can remember seeing several contemporary prints showing samurai in the process of firing hand guns - I think at least one painted by Kuniyoshi (I shall look into the collection and see if I can locate it).<br/>

There is an interesting web site which may provide some background material and serve as a "Springboard" for further research.
