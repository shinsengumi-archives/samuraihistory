<div id="ygrps-yiv-1061263288">To Tim Heaton<br/>
Not wishing to object to anyone's decided or destined<br/>
path through life, in terms of living the life of a<br/>
samurai, who are you to serve, who would be your<br/>
master (or perhaps mistress, this is the 21st<br/>
Century)? Devoid of a master, a samurai('one who<br/>
serves') became a ronin ('wave man') and as the<br/>
Tokugawa period evolved and the state demilitarized,<br/>
being a ronin often led to little more than crime,<br/>
debauchery, poverty, or jobs in teaching or medicine. <br/>
Good luck whatever happens<br/>

horrible English, but haven't wanted to say anything<br/>

somewhat coherent in Japanese, I'm by no means going<br/>

Secondly, the idea of "becoming" a samurai is as<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1240749169">"the true reality". Would that be the true reality of <br/>
living a militaristic style of life based upon the<br/>
subjugation of the rest of society, Confucian ideals<br/>
(hardly the core of liberal ideas and understanding),<br/>
warfare, and exploitation. So why do we study them?<br/>
Sur they're are truly remarkable in their feats and<br/>
effects, but so were the Nazis, Communists, the<br/>
Mongols. Does anyone out there fancy being a<br/>
gauleiter? a nomadic horseman? a KGB official? But of<br/>
course they don't have the appeal od Japan and the<br/>
Japanese. Sure, we are all part of the academic<br/>
Chrysanthenum club, but academia is where it stays in<br/>
regard to the samurai. <br/>

"When did ignorance become a point of view?"<br/>
If you want to talk with people, who know what <br/>
you are talking about, you should maybe join a <br/>
different group. I joined this group to discuss <br/>
and read about samurai history, which is in and<br/>
of itself a somewhat academic topic. A certain<br/>
measure of education might proof to be useful in<br/>
this, whether your parents paid or you yourself.<br/>

<h3>Re: [samuraihistory] (unknown)</h3>
by <i>budreblu</i>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-676783566">Hi, Timothy<br/>
I wasn't going to respond to your letter but the replies became so negative I decided to write.<br/>
What attracted me to study samurai history and culture was its philosophy or its at least its ideal of how to live life.   It is nothing unique in this way of living;  it can be found in the scriptures of all religions, the writings of sages from all over the world, and in the better self help books at your local bookstores.  The difference is in the appearance.<br/>
I never thought to "become a samurai" though years ago there was that fasination.  The closest I ever came was in my karate class where at one point my sensai had to explain to me that this was not the 17th Century.   But from the books that I've read and my own understanding and practice of "The Way", the ideal living, it is all about attaining the higher self: being the best one can be in all endeavors, in all personal interactions, and to oneself.<br/>
No, you can't walk around the street with a katana (even if you take kendo, and if you do you will get bad vibes from your sensai, and possibly arrested by the police) but you could possibly learn tranquillity in a crazy world.  Understand how to live because we all will die. To try to escape from life does more harm than good.  We all have our duty as human beings to live here, right now, aware and awake.<br/>
Whether the samurai lived by these ideals or not does not matter. <br/>
"Each one of us has to create his own method.  If you imitate you'll be wrong.  you have to create for yourself" - Taisen Deshimaru. <br/>
OK, I have to go.  I don't want to be late for work.<br/>
Take care of yourself, Tim. <br/>

i have inquired this listing of samurai history on my<br/>
personal behalf for seeking the answers to the meaning<br/>
of my life.i sincerly seek the way of the samurai,i am<br/>
very serius ,i have much to change about myself and i<br/>
have tried to live as a smurai would live according to<br/>
what i have learned before and it makes sense to me<br/>
but needs get in the way especialy in america and<br/>
since there are few places to go for peace anymore.i<br/>
love the earth and i have proven that by living 25<br/>
years without a drivers liscense and the ownership of<br/>
a pollutting vehichle,i ride a bycycle or walk ,once<br/>
in awhile i except rides,but i insist on standing my<br/>
ground for what i believe even when others throw it in<br/>
my face.i strongly believe in the way of the samurai<br/>
and i choose to be a true samurai no matter what i<br/>
must do, the way of a samurai in which i have<br/>
attempted has made me feel a like i found were i<br/>
belong and it means more to me than anything else in<br/>
all of which ive learned in life.sincerly tim heaton<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-203710259">Again with this? Can we move on to relevant subject? Personally I'm not <br/>
going to bash you're chosen way of life, or anyone else's. But I don't <br/>
have to agree with it. I realize that Mr. Heaton is after a state mental <br/>
"wa" so to speak. But this can be found in any philosophy or religion. <br/>
The path of the samurai is the way of Death. There is no peace in that. <br/>
And it's unimaginably pointless without a "lord", whether that lord is a <br/>
daimyo, a creed or a love.<br/>
