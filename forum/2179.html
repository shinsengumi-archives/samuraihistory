 </span></blockquote>Read  "The Dawn of  Modern Warfare", it's part of the West Point <br/>
Military History series. Sorry he wasn't the first use a combination of <br/>
terrain and guns. Read about Gonzola and his conduct of the battle of <br/>
Cerignola in 1503. These tactics were used by the Spanish and gave rise <br/>
to their ascendency in Europe. I suspect if there was a real innovation, <br/>
it was in his formations and their speed and possibly training. The <br/>
Spanish Tercio was a slow clunky thing to manuveur and fight. Any of the <br/>
three, Oda et. al would have been a top general anywhere in period I think.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>That fits with the figures I've read and my friends with period firearms <br/>
can't really load much faster than that and they have the concept of <br/>
drill down cold. Not something usual for the 1600's soldier.<br/>
