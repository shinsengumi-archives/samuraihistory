<h3>Re: Turnbull (Was Sekigahara)</h3>
by <i>iganokami</i>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-244206728">Turnbull is notorious on the few forums I frequent for being <br/>
innacurate, and has gained the nickname "Buy My Books" Turnbull (take <br/>
a look at his website, and you'll see why).  I found one email from <br/>
this forum that Kitsuno put together showing just one of <br/>
many 'innacuracies' Turnbull has:<br/>
<br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://groups.yahoo.com/group/samuraihistory/message/665">http://groups.yahoo.com/group/samuraihistory/message/665</a><br/>
<br/>
It seems that since he is pretty much 'the only show in town', he <br/>
feels he can slack on the scholarship and get away with it (otherwise <br/>
he is just a poor researcher).  and here is a post I found on another <br/>
Japanese samurai history forum in response to someone posting about <br/>
Turnbull having some new material in one of his books:<br/>
<br/>
----------<br/>
"Turnbull has done 'Digging' and has 'new material'?!?!?!?!?!? <br/>
Has the temperature in Hades fallen that much? <br/>
Hmm... I guess Hiroshi, the gimp Japanese boy Turnbull keeps locked <br/>
in his basement, has been working overtime at those Rekishi Gunzo <br/>
translations.<br/>
<br/>
"I'm sooo hungly, prease gibu me foodo Tahnbull-sama!"<br/>
<br/>
"One more chapter, then you'll eat, Hiroshi. You've almost got me <br/>
enough information for another book! Heh, heh, heh."<br/>
----------<br/>
<br/>
I have a few Rekishi Gunzo books, and even though Turnbull cites them <br/>
in his books, I HIGHLY DOUBT he actually reads them, or uses them, in <br/>
fact, most of what he has comes from Papinot's book, including the <br/>
errors (as stated by kitsuno at the above link - including the fact <br/>
that Turnbull doesn't CITE the book in his bibliography, which to me <br/>
is outright plaigiarism) - and after 20 years of 'research', Turnbull <br/>
hasn't corrected any of his errors.<br/>
<br/>
Unfortunately, unlike the world of ancient Roman scholarship where if <br/>
someone like Turnbull tried to pass himself off as a scholar he would <br/>
be hung, then after his corpse is burned at the stake, his remains <br/>
would fed to lions, there is apparently no similar 'peer review' in <br/>
Japanese history scholarship in "the West".<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Well, for what it is worth, he is not the only shoddy and inaccurate<br/>
historian out there these days.  Stanley Ambrose and Michael Besailles<br/>
are two that have come under intense media scrutiny for plagiarism and<br/>
falsification/errors.  And then there was the whole Fujimura scandal<br/>
here in Japan.<br/>

writer than Turnbull, and only has plaigarism issues, not scholarship <br/>
issues like our buddy Turbull.  I can't argue with "Iganokami", he's <br/>
got a point...<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1682557697">Turnbull seems to be everybody's favorite punching bag. I agree with a lot<br/>
of what's been said. My own complaint about him is that most of his books<br/>
are essentially the same e.g a survey history of the samurai. To stand up<br/>
for him at least he writes about the samurai in a clear and interesting way.<br/>
Yes his books have some errors and sloppy research. However most of the<br/>
material seems accurate enough. I also have the rekishi gunzo series (about<br/>
40 of them), plus the Visual Nihon Rekishi series, Saigen Nihonshi, Sengoku<br/>
Hao, and the Sengoku Chronicle, all of these confirm most of what's in<br/>
Turnbulls books. Unfortunately most other 'scholars' in Japanese history are<br/>
more interested in 'fractal spatiality in the provincial rice fields of the<br/>
bakufu' and don't want to dirty their hands by writing something, heaven<br/>
forbid, for  the average reader. If  more did so and Turnbull had more<br/>
competition to deal with then perhaps his books would be better.<br/>

<h3>Re: Turnbull (Was Sekigahara)</h3>
by <i>iganokami</i>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-186751176">My one big complaint is that he seems to only draw from mostly all <br/>
English sources, the Rekishi Gunzo books only agree with what he puts <br/>
in his books because they agree with his English sources (except <br/>
where he has innacurate info).  He doesn't appear to USE the Japanese <br/>
sources he so proudly cites, and if he does, it is always very <br/>
general info a third year student of Japanese could pull off of a map <br/>
or timeline in one of the books.  No hard info.<br/>
Not to mention the fact that in 20 years he hasn't really added all <br/>
that much to his 'scholarship'.  <br/>
<br/>
I guess I would have absolutely no complaints at all if he didn't <br/>
claim to be a DOCTOR of Japanese history. That is my biggest <br/>
complaint with the guy. If someone has enough bravado to claim to be <br/>
a DOCTOR of Japanese history, then they sure as heck should be able <br/>
to back it up (can someone PLEASE TELL ME exactly WHAT his doctorate <br/>
is in??? or if he even has one at all?).  I've seen shoddy work from <br/>
plenty of 'Martial Arts' related ""Samurai History"", but forgive <br/>
that because they are looking at history thru the seriously warped <br/>
lense of the martial arts world, where Samurai practiced Karate in <br/>
secret Dojos and had an official 'samurai code of honor' handbook <br/>
they 'lived by' during the Sengoku period, and Ninja kidnapped <br/>
children from villages and trained them in the secret arts of the <br/>
black ninja clan and sold thier services to the highest bidding <br/>
Daimyo blah blah blah.<br/>
<br/>
Based on what you wrote, it appear that at worst Turnbull is a poor, <br/>
unskilled historian, and at best a slacker: <br/>
"...and don't want to dirty their hands by writing something, heaven <br/>
forbid, for  the average reader. If  more did so and Turnbull had <br/>
more competition to deal with then perhaps his books would be better."<br/>

Early and Middle Palaeolithic finds in this country over the past 20<br/>
some odd years.  Since peer review hardly works in this country (Japan),<br/>
he was pretty much able to pull a fast one until MAINICHI SHIMBUN caught<br/>
him on film burying fake artifacts.<br/>

Admittedly, not Sengoku jidai, but....<br/>
