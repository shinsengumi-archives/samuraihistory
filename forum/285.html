<div id="ygrps-yiv-1049607298">I did see a documentary on the history channel a year or two ago.  It was <br/>
not particularly scholarly, but of some use as an introductory look at the <br/>
development of the Japanese warrior over time.  The documentary included <br/>
excerpts pf interviews with a few of the "biggies": Stephen Turnbull, G. <br/>
Cameron Hurst and Karl Friday.  I did a search on the history channel <br/>
website and came up with the following:<br/>
<br/>
                        In Search of History:<br/>
                        Samurai Warrior<br/>
                        Price: $19.95<br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.historychannel.com">http://www.historychannel.com</a><br/>
<br/>
This seems a bit steep of a price from what I remember of the content, but <br/>
perhaps someone else on the list could give a more detailed accounting.  One <br/>
caveat, I seem to recall an email conversation with Prof. Friday in which he <br/>
intimated that some of his statements were taken a bit out of context.<br/>
<br/>
Cheers,<br/>
<br/>
