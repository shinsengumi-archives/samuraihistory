 </span></blockquote>Thanks. Not sure what version of Outlook I have at work, but you can't put <br/>
the little >>'s in automatically in this version; I would have to do each line <br/>
by hand and that is a huge pain which I simply don't have time for.  It's set <br/>
up for business and the way it is set up, that's standard business practice. <br/>
<br/>
So if you can pardon me, when I'm posting from work, using their version of <br/>
Outlook, I'm going to go back to the top-posting. I will always try and edit <br/>
out all of the comments I am commenting on, other than the relevant parts, so <br/>
there won't be that much to scroll down and read. <br/>
<br/>
However, when I'm home, using AOL, AOL will format it for me, so I can <br/>
sprinkle in my responses between the >'s and >>'s that AOL automatically puts in. <br/>
However, I am unable to access my AOL account from work. <br/>
<br/>
Cheers, Nina</div>

 </span></blockquote>I know outlook and outlook express are different, so no big deal.  <br/>
Maybe since it doesn't add in the >>> you could just do something <br/>
like this:<br/>
<br/>
original post paragraph blah blah blah<br/>
<br/>
----------------------<br/>
<br/>
nina's response<br/>
<br/>
---------------------<br/>
<br/>
next paragraph of blah blah blah<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
I dunno, just a thought. I don't even know why I'm worrying about it.</div>

 </span></blockquote>I thought about that. It still requires a significant amount of <br/>
hand-formatting, putting the '--------------'s between each comment, typing each little '-' <br/>
in one by one several times while going through the comments.   I have <br/>
serious doubts that any of the Outlook users really have this sort of time and/or <br/>
patience for this sort of custom-formatting.  <br/>

 </span></blockquote>That actually is a very good question -- really, why are you worrying about <br/>
it? If users (using ANY email format) can be encouraged to snip out the <br/>
comments that are not directly relevant, then I don't see what the huge deal is about <br/>
doing a bit of scrolling down to see the relevant comments that a poster is <br/>
replying to. <br/>
<br/>
Many people use Outlook, with their reply format on many other lists that I <br/>
participate in.  Snipping out old comments that aren't relevant does frequently <br/>
come up as an issue on these lists. But the "top-posting" thing has never <br/>
come up as an issue on any of these lists other than this one.<br/>
<br/>
As for me, I'm now at home and using AOL. So no top-posting here.  :)<br/>
