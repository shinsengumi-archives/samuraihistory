<h3>Clan in New York?</h3>
by <i>depos42300</i>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1005002043">hello,<br/>
  i was wondering if anyone knows if there are any samurai clans in the SCA that are around NEW YORK STATE? Meaning,... is there a clan that specifically focuses on wearing samurai armour to the SCA events??? If so, please let me know. I've checked the SCA website and couldn't find any. Thank you. <br/>
                             mark<br/>
 <br/>
P.S. I take kendo. Will that be helpful in fighting in these events?? I've never been to one but have heard a lot of awesome things about them. Thanks again. <br/>
