<br/>
Cyberbudo and The Japanese Sword.com are pleased to announce the attendance <br/>
of master swordsmith Ono Yoshimitsu and master sword polisher Abe Kazunori <br/>
to Seni 07 (www.senishow.com) at the Excel Centre, Docklands, London May <br/>
19/20. This is a rare opportunity for anyone interested in Japanese swords, <br/>
as this is the first time that these two master craftsmen have appeared <br/>
outside of Japan.<br/>
<br/>
Ono Yoshimitsu is a strong candidate to become a Living National Treasure. <br/>
At the annual sword forging competition he won the top prize (Prince <br/>
Takamatsu Award) four times in a row and five times in total�a feat <br/>
unachieved by any of his contemporaries. Now ranked mukansa (above <br/>
competition level), he no longer has to compete as his blades are guaranteed <br/>
display at the annual exhibition in the Japanese Sword Museum, Tokyo. This <br/>
is a rare chance to see a real master demonstrating some of the processes of <br/>
sword making and view some of his works. Yoshimitsu is renowned for his <br/>
re-creation of the Japanese national treasure sword called the Yamatorige. <br/>
On this occasion we will be fortunate enough to be able to see this <br/>
displayed at the Cyberbudo stand.<br/>
<br/>
Abe Kazunori is a mukansa ranked Japanese sword polisher. A winner of seven <br/>
first prizes at the annual sword polishing competition in Japan, he is one <br/>
of the top polishers in Japan today and has been entrusted with polishing <br/>
many important Japanese swords. Also a producer of oshigata (hand drawn <br/>
records of Japanese swords) for a major sword publication, Abe will be <br/>
giving lectures over the weekend and will be demonstrating traditional <br/>
Japanese sword polishing techniques throughout the day at the Cyberbudo <br/>
stand.<br/>
