The tachi was worn slung from the waist edge down and was in practical<br/>
use from ca 900 - 1600. It was used for fighting on horseback. <br/>
 <br/>
The katana is worn edge up in the sash round the Samurai's middle and<br/>
was used from ca. 1400 - 1876. This was used for ground combat. <br/>
 <br/>
There is some overlap in when they were used. <br/>

The old court swords were tachi. For a long time, "tachi" seems to have been the <br/>
generic word for sword. It wasn't until much later (probably no earlier than the <br/>
15th C.) that the samaurai began to wear upside-down swords thrust through their <br/>

  The katana does not need to be worn ha (blade) down in order to cut on the <br/>
draw, this would actually be a bad thing to do.  The sword styles that fall <br/>
under the influence of Iaido/jutsu and battoudo/jutsu wear the katana ha up <br/>
and base their main premise on a simultaneous draw and cut, called battou.  <br/>
The construction of the saya (sheath) for most katana is of wood and if the <br/>
katana was drawn ha down it would split the saya and cut open the users <br/>
hand.  The metalic construction and/or reinforcement of the tachi saya <br/>
allowed for that blade to be drawn ha downward.<br/>
  I hope this was helped somehow.<br/>

<h3>Re: [samuraihistory] TACHI</h3>
by <i>soshuju</i>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1836487872">Syun et al-<br/>
	<br/>
	Short answer; Tachi preceeded katana and yes they werre very much <br/>
fighting weapons.<br/>
	Tachi when used among students of the sword is a specific term used to <br/>
describe single edged, usually curved Japanese sword worn hung from the <br/>
waist. It developed from straight Chinese and Korean models imported <br/>
from the continent. All of which were fighting weapons.<br/>
	There is debate about the use of the tachi, I fall in the camp that <br/>
feels it took on its unique shape to meet the rigors of mounted combat. <br/>
If we examine the small points of these swords I think it is clear they <br/>
were not used much for thrusting. Rather they were for slashing from <br/>
horseback at armours made primarily of heavy silk. At the time the bow <br/>
was the premier weapon and the sword was a side arm resorted to after <br/>
all arrows had been exhausted.<br/>
	We imagine it to have been developed in the tenth century(or perhaps <br/>
earlier) and by the 1100's was in use by the bushi class all over <br/>
Japan. After the shock of the Mongol invasions, points became stouter <br/>
austensibly because thrusting techniques became more prevalent. Then <br/>
the whole sword took on grand proportions. Not long after the katana <br/>
came a long but it was in the mid to late Muromachi that it became the <br/>
sidearm of choice. The tachi continued to be worn by cavalry and in the <br/>
Azuchi-Momoyama we see fighting generals carrying tachi made famous in <br/>
the days of Yoritomo.<br/>
	For example Uesugi Kenshin and Akechi Mitsuhide were known to favor <br/>
Bizen Nagamitsu, considered by many to be the top smith from that part <br/>
of the country known as "the sword capitol" of Japan. Edo period <br/>

Mr. Wilson,<br/>
<br/>
  The katana does not need to be worn ha (blade) down in order to cut on the <br/>
draw, this would actually be a bad thing to do.  The sword styles that fall <br/>
under the influence of Iaido/jutsu and battoudo/jutsu wear the katana ha up <br/>
and base their main premise on a simultaneous draw and cut, called battou.  <br/>
The construction of the saya (sheath) for most katana is of wood and if the <br/>
katana was drawn ha down it would split the saya and cut open the users <br/>
hand.  The metalic construction and/or reinforcement of the tachi saya <br/>
allowed for that blade to be drawn ha downward.<br/>
  I hope this was helped somehow.<br/>

<br/>
No matter which way the katana is worn, generally when<br/>
a katana is draw this is the first cut, be worn up<br/>
wards or downwards. <br/>
<br/>
as the katana is generally worn cutting edge upwards,<br/>
it is turned in the belt 180 degrees prior to drawing<br/>
if you wish to cut upwards on the draw.<br/>
<br/>
anyone in iaido or Iajutsu can confirm this.<br/>
<br/>
Schools shuch as Kukishin ryu have no Iai, there<br/>
swordsmanship is started with the blade already drawn<br/>

<br/>
there is one sword that is being missed here - the<br/>

the Tachi we all know was the sword of favour in the<br/>

<br/>
For those not familiar with the handachi - it has a<br/>
saya and tsuka as good as Identical to the tachi, but<br/>
the suspention rings on the saya are removed and the<br/>
sword is then thrust through the belt int he same way<br/>
as a Katana. Its involvement in the transision between<br/>
katana and Tachi i am not sure of.<br/>
<br/>
we are also aware that in the early the days the<br/>
samurai were men of horse and the bow, this then with<br/>
time and change in the way battles were fought had the<br/>
samuari also go to fighting on foot, theref ore the<br/>
bow was reduced in status and corps of archers<br/>
appeared be it samurai or ashigaru. The Yari (spear)<br/>

points I discovered when i first wore the armour.<br/>
<br/>
the tachi is fine but to draw downwards when in arm<br/>
you have to bend a bit and the draw is slow. therefore<br/>
turning the sword cutting edge up the draw was faster<br/>
and the bending of the body  removed.<br/>
<br/>
the tachi when moving about a lot and especially when<br/>
running bangs up and down against you constantly. This<br/>
was annoying and you had to hold it if you wanted to<br/>

A katana is nice and tight to the body, much easier to<br/>

<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-817548178">'' the tachi is fine but to draw downwards when in arm<br/>

Probably because the Tachi shape with its Koshizori was studied for<br/>
one-hand-drawing from horseback, avoiding the animal neck, and a little<br/>
before the reaching of the enemy, with no urge. <br/>
<br/>
''A katana is nice and tight to the body, much easier to<br/>
draw''<br/>
By foot. Is the reason because of Katana replaced Tachi. In combat by<br/>
foot or duels the possibility to strike unsheating the blade was of<br/>
great advantage.<br/>
<br/>
As per Handachi, I think it is a kind of blade mounting rather than a<br/>
different type of sword, generally remembering the Tachi's mounting<br/>
shape but a bit different, much less elegant, mostly used in Edo times.<br/>

space for the bowstring to be drawn and released?<br/>
Just a thought I had, but I would think that a large<br/>
katana tsuka would get in the way especially when<br/>
shooting to your left,<br/>
but then again I could be wrong. Timewise the katana<br/>
was replacing the tachi at the same time that the bow<br/>
was falling out <br/>

  Yes, the tachi can be used in fights.. it was<br/>
originally developed as a cavalry sword.. the longer<br/>
blade and more pronounced curve were designed to be<br/>
used form horseback.. much like the western examples<br/>
of a saber in comparisson to the rapier.. the tachi<br/>
was worn blade down whereas the katana was worn blade<br/>
up.. the difference was that when you drew the tachi<br/>
from horseback, the first draw would be a slice.. and<br/>
the katana's first draw would be a slice as well, if<br/>
worn blade down.. as far as dates, it seems that the<br/>
tachi may be a predeccessor to the katana, but I am<br/>
NOT sure..<br/>

  I've been wondering about the Tachi, its different<br/>
from the usual <br/>
  katana type sword. And bit elegant too in terms of<br/>
looks. Can Tachi <br/>
  be used in fights? And the timeline of the tachi<br/>
co-existed with the <br/>
  Katana or it came after the Katana?<br/>

<br/>
  No problem.  I am glad that we are on the same page now.  My appologies <br/>
for any miscommunication.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Mr. Richardson,<br/>
<br/>
  It is possible to draw the blade in a battou type action and not cut.  <br/>
Defensive battou techniques, such as intetcepting cuts or angled parrys, <br/>
come into play quite often in Iaido.  As a general rule of thumb, according <br/>
to my Iaido sensei, if you are doing a single hand technique, especially one <br/>
from a draw, it is Iai.  Once the second hand touches the tsuka (handle) is <br/>
becomes kenjutsu.  Which separates schools like Kukishin Ryu from schools <br/>
like Muso Shinden Ryu.<br/>
  For offensive battou techniques that do not involve a downward cut the <br/>
turning of the saya (sheath) is not done until the very last possible <br/>
moment.  Partly to keep the side of the blade from being scratched up from <br/>
any dirt inside the saya (sheath) and also to keep the ha (cutting edge) <br/>
from splitting the saya.<br/>
  I hope that this came off more as a response and not as an arguement.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-37484283">The Blade up/ Blade down idea can be explained by the<br/>
drawing of the sword and the first strike. Face to<br/>
face, the draw becomes an over hand slice to the<br/>
opponents head. On horseback the opponent could be a<br/>
footmen thus lower than the rider. The initial draw<br/>
with the blade down would lead to a upward slice. <br/>

	I am afraid I have to disagree, at the time the tachi was en vogue <br/>
there were few "ground troops" to cut at. For all we really know the <br/>
tachi was drawn blade up. What we know for sure is, it was worn blade <br/>
down. I believe they were edge down because the Chinese models they <br/>
were based on were all also worn edge down.<br/>
	With the change to the katana the idea of "batto" has more credence. <br/>
Try walking ten or fifteen miles a day in Oyoroi with a sword banging <br/>
on your hip. Lash that same sword to your side with a wide sash, edge <br/>
up, and it carries itself. The katana can effectively draw and cut, <br/>
ground to sky as well as overhand when worn edge up. Still the single <br/>
hand "overhand" draw is common in many sword schools and it's speed and <br/>
effectiveness may indeed have been the main reason for the rise of the <br/>
Uchi-katana.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-628494805">It seems blade up or down depends on how you wear the sword. The pictures of tachi that I've seen have a cord or string that makes the sword dangle from the waist. That makes it lower and more natural to draw with edge down. The katana is usually worn stuck into a sash with the handle pointing up at a slight angle. This would make it easier to be drawn with the edge up. All the samurai movies as well as the old engravings and artwork I've seen have the edge up on katanas, edge down with tachis.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1616553847">Going by the teachings of some superior powers in my<br/>
life, I've tried to stay out of this discussion as<br/>
long as possible, but I really have to ask at this<br/>
point.<br/>
<br/>
Morihei Ueshiba only had 1/4 "samurai" blood in him<br/>
from his mother's side, far enough removed most would<br/>
say to not even mention.  Yet one of the heaviest<br/>
parts of his philosophy was about being a samurai and<br/>
about practicioners of Aikido being modern day samurai<br/>
and so forth.  I know that someone being old and wise<br/>
doesn't make them right, but would all the "There's no<br/>
such thing as a Samurai!" nay-sayers actually argue<br/>
with this?  I know reading several books about<br/>
O-sensei, his word was enough for me to buy into the<br/>
whole "spirit" of the Samurai over the "title" of one.<br/>
<br/>
There's many more examples, too.  I mean, I certainly<br/>
wouldn't feel right going up to a family in modern day<br/>
Japan that actually had a direct father to son lineage<br/>
of "Samurai" blood and telling them that they weren't<br/>
a Samurai if they truely beleived they were.  I think<br/>
they have more of a right to make that decission than<br/>
I do.<br/>
<br/>
Finally, what of the Japanese emperor?  Is he not<br/>
emperor only in title with no real depth other than a<br/>
"pre-dated" concept of an emperor in honor (a word I<br/>
stress the use of in this situation).  If I'm correct,<br/>
what makes his title as emperor that much differant<br/>
than a nobleman's title of samurai?<br/>
<br/>
I am 19 years old, full anglo-saxon decent as I've<br/>
noted already.  I wake every morning and pray to MY<br/>
lord, Christ, and everynight before bed, on my knees,<br/>
seiza position.  I practice kendo, kenjutsu, jiu<br/>
jitsu, aikido and am terribly interested in invovling<br/>
myself in kyudo and the use of japanese polearms.  I<br/>
am pursuing a career in law enforcement and find<br/>
bushido to be an excellent basis for my career, and<br/>
most importantly my faith, my relationship with<br/>
Christ.  But I am not a Samurai, just a 19 year old<br/>
geek that wishes he could have been.  But who would<br/>
someone like I, no matter how well versed in history,<br/>
be to tell someone that they weren't a Samurai?<br/>

<h3>I do mean to carry on a dead subject... [still samurai?]</h3>
by <i>sjcarpediem</i>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-2014832084">I get my posts in daily digests (as well as it being Finals' Season<br/>
(TM)), so forgive me to be so late joining in, here.  Also, I've yet <br/>
to read every last response, so pls also bear with me.<br/>
<br/>
The question was if there are still samurai.  The discussion quickly <br/>
established that the legal title of "samurai" was disestablished in <br/>
1870s legislation as part of both the Meiji Restoration and Japanese <br/>
modernization/westernization.  I agree w/the others' in their <br/>
interpretation of the question as not addressing legal status, but as <br/>
an inquiry into the vitality of a concept of "samurai" embodied in <br/>
the way ppl lead their lives.<br/>
<br/>
To me, in this light, asking if there are still samurai is a lot like <br/>
asking if there are still trees. (But how else does one learn?)  I <br/>
suppose it does all depend on how you define a tree, but the point <br/>
remains and is even translingual: a rose is a rose, ne?<br/>
<br/>
Ppl who wail about there "not being samurai" simply because some law <br/>
that is over a century old said so; when history, and the passage of <br/>
time, and sociology, and psychology, and simple reason tells us there <br/>
still are samurai have become far too attached to titles, and, I dare <br/>
say, it is good they don't call themselves samurai.<br/>
<br/>
Even after that bit of legal history was put down, ppl still carried <br/>
their weaponry, they still applied themselves to a certain philosophy <br/>
of life, they still served masters, they still embraced death as a <br/>
part of life, they still pursued learning in many areas, both <br/>
concrete and abstract, in other words: the law did not "un-samurai" <br/>
them.  Therefore, there are still samurai.<br/>

  That is where the issue of differences between styles comes in.  I train <br/>
in Muso Shinden Ryu and have been taught to keep the ha (cutting edge) up <br/>
until the last moment.  This is partly to cut down on the noise that a <br/>
battou would cause and partly to cut down on any friction.  Any sand or dirt <br/>
inside the saya would stratch up the side of the blade if it was drawn in <br/>
any manner besides ha up.  Since blades, when properly on display, on shown <br/>
ha up with the tsuka (handle) to the left it would be displaying the side <br/>
that was getting scratched up.<br/>
  This is just what I have been taught.  Out of curiosity, what style of <br/>
Iaido did you study?<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-664284837">To be perfectly honest, Im not sure. I studied Aikido for a while when I was younger. I decided one day I wanted to pursue the sword, but my old sensei wasnt teaching any more. He worked at the Army Surplus store I frequent. So at night, I would take my sword there to the store and he would show me forms and katas and such. I havent studied very much. Hence why in one previous email I said "my very limited training". On a side note, Im working my way thru some books on the Eishin Ryu until I can find a sensei to start taking classes. <br/>

	 I am personally acquainted with folks in Japan who have practiced <br/>
their family craft for more than 20 generations. Under the Tokugawa and <br/>
earlier Shoguns they were privileged members of the Bakufu and their <br/>
status as "Bushi", unquestioned. Today they still carry on the family <br/>
traditions and live lives little changed from those earlier times. <br/>
There are other people who live austere lifestyles unchanged from <br/>
before the days of Ieyasu.<br/>
	I am convinced that even though these people have the pedigree and <br/>
walk the walk ( and talk the talk...) they would never call themselves <br/>
"samurai" or more properly "Bushi".  Were I to say "you ARE samurai", <br/>
they would politely laugh and correct me. There are no more "Samurai".<br/>
	Keeping in mind the harsh reality that was pre-Modern Japan, I would <br/>
say that they are something much better...<br/>
