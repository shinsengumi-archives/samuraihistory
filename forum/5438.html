THE WASHINGTON TIMES<br/>
<br/>
The most persuasive argument for film preservation in my lifetime has <br/>
been the continuing enhancement of Akira Kurosawa's "Seven Samurai," <br/>
which has returned through next weekend in a 50th-anniversary <br/>
engagement at the American Film Institute's National Theater at the <br/>
Kennedy Center. <br/>
    The last booking of this majestic historical-martial-social epic, <br/>
the most intimate and stirring of all cinematic adventure spectacles, <br/>
revealed an unexpected bonus: freshly colloquial and eye-opening <br/>
translation of the Japanese dialogue, sometimes commensurate with an <br/>
R rating. <br/>
<br/>
Given the context of the story  a vividly gritty celebration of <br/>
self-defense set in the 16th century, when impoverished farmers <br/>
succeed in recruiting a band of samurai mercenaries to protect their <br/>
next harvest from marauding bandits  the previously obscured verbal <br/>
bluntness and pungency were not out of line. <br/>
<br/>
    However, parents may want to take it into consideration when <br/>
introducing older children to this superlative movie. They'll be <br/>
reading a more outspoken movie while seeing an eyeful of heroic <br/>
conflict and sacrifice. <br/>
<br/>
    I first saw "Seven Samurai" in its original 160-minute import <br/>
version when I was in high school. By this time, more than four years <br/>
after its Japanese premiere, the movie already was a revival <br/>
attraction, one of several foreign-language landmarks that came to my <br/>
attention while frequenting the long-gone Berkeley, Calif., <br/>
storefront theaters the Cinema Guild & Studio, managed at that time <br/>
by Pauline Kael. <br/>
<br/>
    Both the auditoriums and the screen sizes were cramped, to put it <br/>
kindly, so quite a few years went by before I saw a suitably <br/>
magnified "Samurai." <br/>
<br/>
    Columbia, the U.S. importer, also had renamed it "The Magnificent <br/>
Seven," the title of 1960's durably appealing John Sturges-directed <br/>
Western homage to Mr. Kurosawa's prototype, which co-starred Yul <br/>
Brynner and Steve McQueen. <br/>
<br/>
    Film historian Donald Richie prepared the groundwork for an <br/>
eventual restoration of the complete "Seven Samurai" in his 1965 <br/>
critical study, "The Films of Akira Kurosawa." His appreciation was <br/>
shadowed by a provocative caveat: "Nevertheless, 'Seven Samurai' has, <br/>
outside Japan in 1954, never really been seen. This is one of the <br/>
major cinematic tragedies." <br/>
<br/>
    Americans weren't the only ones who had been shortchanged. A <br/>
later historian, Stuart Galbraith IV, chronicled the careers of Mr. <br/>
Kurosawa and his pre-eminent leading man, Toshiro Mifune, in a volume <br/>
titled "The Emperor and the Wolf." Mr. Galbraith wrote: "Because of <br/>
its extreme length, the complete 'Seven Samurai' ... was limited to <br/>
its first few weeks [of release], and only in Japan's biggest cities. <br/>
In rural areas and in subsequent runs it was cut to a more <br/>
manageable, if compromised length." <br/>
<br/>
    Evidently, the shortened Japanese versions corresponded to the <br/>
160-minute export edition, which betrayed little slack and dazzled <br/>
its first generation of U.S. admirers. A complete reissue began <br/>
creeping up on the public eager to discover it. There were <br/>
scattered "special event" bookings toward the end of the 1960s and a <br/>
PBS telecast in 1972. However, another decade passed before the <br/>
Japanese distributor, Toho, mounted a full-blown theatrical revival <br/>
of the whole show, which reached Washington in spring 1983 and <br/>
clinched the case for greatness. <br/>
<br/>
    The cuts had shaved certain episodes to the bone. The <br/>
restorations disclosed how methodical, straightforward and detailed <br/>
the complete scenario had been. All the subplots, the private little <br/>
dramas played out against the larger crisis of defending and saving <br/>
the village, were systematic and absorbing rather than fleeting. <br/>
<br/>
    The cumulative effect added thematic weight and dignity to what <br/>
always had seemed a nobly envisioned and realized movie. <br/>
<br/>
Incredibly, "Seven Samurai" is still demonstrating room for <br/>
improvement in the first decade of a new century. The video editions <br/>
of the movie have yet to reflect the recent changes to the subtitles, <br/>
so for the time being, the most complete "Samurai" is an exclusive at <br/>
repertory theaters. <br/>
<br/>
    Who says things are always going from bad to worse? In this case, <br/>
a great movie keeps getting better than you realized. <br/>
