<h3>MaKu screens on the field</h3>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1053075579">Hello people,<br/>
<br/>
I am building a few camps for a wargame and I wish to build a camp <br/>
for Takeda and one for Uesugi. The dimensions are 80mm by 80mm in <br/>
15mm scale. I found a good diagram in a Bryant book that shows the <br/>
camp organized, however my question is how would the Maku screens be <br/>
organized? Are they in a rectangle shap but with three sides of walls <br/>
with an open front or fully enclosed , if so where is the door <br/>
opening? Would it be a full square with a small opening in the front?<br/>
<br/>
What mon would be used on the screen? The Takeda black lozenge on a <br/>
red background like in his battle standard?<br/>
<br/>
What about Uesugi his love bird mon? Would his personal retainers <br/>
have that as their mon on the sashimono?<br/>
<br/>
And who would be inside the maku screen? The gen, his nobori and uma-<br/>
jirushi,his consultants, some personal guard retainers. Would the <br/>
Taiko drums be inside or outside? What about the Conch trumpets would <br/>
they be in or out?<br/>
<br/>
His personal horse would be the rear I would assume?</div>
