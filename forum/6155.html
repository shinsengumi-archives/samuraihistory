<h3>New gaijin on the block</h3>
by <i>geregjonesmuller</i>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-340788871">Matt -<br/>
	I don't think anybody else is actually gong to be blatant or direct enough<br/>
to recommend Anthony Bryant's Osprey book on the Samurai of the Tudor period<br/>
(although oddly enough, as you may think, it isn't titled _exactly_ that),<br/>
because Tony's too ethical (and too proud) to do it and Nate knows him too<br/>
well... so I might as well just out and say it.  Good book.  (And I didn't<br/>
even know the author was here when I signed onto the list.)  Particularly<br/>
interesting to you, I would guess, because of the period it covers - Japan<br/>
during Queen Elizabeth's time (God save her).<br/>
	Now knowing your dramatic background, and knowing that this isn't your<br/>
usual milieu (Pilot Adams, I presume?  -Sorry, that's a kind of 'Shogun'<br/>
joke), let me commend to your attention a few films for general 'feel'.<br/>
None of these is actual history, of course.  But there's lots (and lots and<br/>
LOTS) of crrrap out there, and it's easy to get lost in delusions based on<br/>
bad period drama.  You know how it goes.  (A perfectly pleasant and<br/>
intelligent soul recently said here that "Rurouni Kenshin" seemed to be<br/>
reasonably historical, for example, provoking uncontrollable fits of<br/>
laughter from Tony.)  So here's some _good_ period drama, by way of<br/>
contrast.<br/>
...It'll be interesting to see how this list goes over on this list, in<br/>
fact. (By the way, I have to admit here and now to a sneaking fondness for<br/>
the manga of "Rurouni Kenshin" (I've seen nothing of the anime, so have no<br/>
opinion), but let's say I've ...reserved judgement ...on any historical<br/>
details I came across in the storyline...)<br/>
<br/>
		Stuff by Kurosawa Akira (look under 'K', not 'A')<br/>
Seven Samurai<br/>
Hidden Fortress<br/>
	...both set in the Warring States period (roughly while Gloriana sat the<br/>
throne of England)<br/>
Yojimbo<br/>
Sanjuro<br/>
	...some centuries later - these are bloody hilarious:  and I mean both.  As<br/>
I recall, these are set in the mid-1800s.<br/>
<br/>
	Stuff by Inagaki Hiroshi (under 'I', not 'H')<br/>
Chushingura<br/>
...set about 1700 -the archetypal samurai epic:  the 47 Ronin done on the<br/>
scale of 'Gone With The Wind' - think of it as the Japanese cultural<br/>
equivalent to Thermopylae, the Alamo, the Titanic, and the Easter Uprising<br/>
all rolled into one.  This film is long and slow, and it's hard for a gaijin<br/>
(at least) to keep track of everybody the first time or two through it...<br/>
but it's wonderful for all that.  Many of the shots were taken directly from<br/>
classic woodcuts of the episode.<br/>
The Samurai Trilogy<br/>
...a popularised (and fairly implausible) version of the life of Musashi<br/>
Miyamoto, author of the Book of Five Rings (or Spheres)... arguably the<br/>
greatest of the samurai.  (I've heard he's referred to as "Kensei" in Japan,<br/>
and if someone would give me a more clear definition of that than Harris's<br/>
"sword-saint" I would be most grateful.)  Matt, I've made the better part of<br/>
a life's study of this work.  Strong talk from an Arrogant Son-Of-a-Bitch<br/>
like me, you may note.  I carry a small copy of the book on me the way some<br/>
folks carry a Bible, and I have never exhausted what I can learn from it.<br/>
If I ever achieve a fraction of Musashi's mastery, I will regard myself as<br/>
fortunate beyond my deserts.<br/>
...Now don't expect this trilogy to make a hell of a lot of sense in terms<br/>
of sequential plot line unless you've read the lengthy book on which it's<br/>
based, but it's beautifully made and it's packed with a zillion little<br/>
period details.  The novel was written and serialised in the 1930s, and<br/>
reflects some of the most impressively developed virgin/whore dichotomy I've<br/>
ever seen anywhere.<br/>
<br/>
	Now then:  if Kitsuno (the list-owner:  a Mysterious Figure with whom I've<br/>
never exchanged a post:  some say he's really a fox spirit), or Tony, Nate,<br/>
Dean or any of you other elitist, ASOB lot have some suggestions I've<br/>
missed, I'd be only too happy for the recommendation.  I've just about got<br/>
the ones I've listed memorised already.  (I only pray I'm not opening a<br/>
floodgate of raving fandom.)<br/>

<h3>Re: [samuraihistory] New gaijin on the block</h3>
by <i>yeomanforbes</i>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1382009268">Erg.<br/>
<br/>
Gents, I was joking about English in subtitles. JOKING, I say!  <br/>
<br/>
Seriously, I'll watch whatever movies y'all recommend on the subject, and<br/>
would prefer some sort of translation in to the bastard tongue of English,<br/>
but I can probably chew through something all in Japanese if I had to.  I<br/>
just wouldn't know why people did what they did, but it's sorta like watching<br/>
those Japanese soap operas.  It can be amusing... for a few minutes, if<br/>
"Desperate housewives" isn't on at the moment.  <br/>
<br/>
I sense that Momoyama period might, indeed, be the one I'd find the first<br/>
interest in, but only due to the relative safety of knowing a bit about the<br/>
1550s elsewhere in the European sphere and thus having some safety to flee<br/>
toward when cornered on a period.  "Um... I don't know... um... but the<br/>
Fuggers *were* a very powerful banking family in the Germanies, you know." <br/>
See? Pull out not-very-useful fact and wave it around to distract people<br/>
while you slip the other direction. <br/>
<br/>
While Mr. Turnbull is engaging in his own way, I was attracted to a shiny<br/>
thing, like a magpie, and went burbling into the pre-history of that<br/>
thoroughly unSamurai-like fellow, Mr. Ming ("The") and his happy, rollicking<br/>
dynasty.  Now that we know the ships thing was related to the rise and fall<br/>
of the eunichs-- and make no mistake, no double entendre there; none<br/>
possible-- I'm still fascinated about what the heck those crazy Chinese were<br/>
thinking in 1351 during the whole Red Turban affair, and how it relates to<br/>
"let's sink a perfectly good largest fleet in the world in 1433 and turn<br/>
really insular."  A monk, you say, as emporer?  Preposterous. <br/>
<br/>
In the meantime, then, I shall be chastened to return to the pearl isle to<br/>
learn more about how many soldiers you have to provide for every cho of<br/>
riceland you own (and here I thought, all along, Koko was the name of the<br/>
gorilla who did the sign language with a cat.  With a CAT! The cat can't do<br/>
sign language.  It was a doomed experiment).<br/>
<br/>
This sort of mundane detail brings me to a quick question, perhaps not easily<br/>
answered: What did the sandal-bearer and the rain-hat carriers do?  Rain-hat<br/>
carrier?  This, from a list on page 9 of Mr. Turnbull's Samurai ("u" not "a")<br/>
Armies: 1550-1615 Osprey book.  No offense to Tony, but this was the only<br/>
offering from those fine �5,000 per book fellows available at the Central<br/>
Library, so I took it.  <br/>
<br/>
You've got all these ashigaro carrying all sorts of things, but to have a guy<br/>
to carry rain hats?  Interesting.  And sandals? Wouldn't people carry their<br/>
own? Maybe they were artisans to make/create new ones when old ones wore out<br/>
or damaged.  Still... <br/>

<br/>
Kitsuno, the owner of this email list, lives in<br/>
Oita-ken. Some small remote village where they still<br/>
dress like Watanabe Ken in "The Last Samurai". <br/>
<br/>
Okay, not really...but it's somewhere in Oita-ken.<br/>

(Fuurinkazan) is a favorite choice. Owl's Castle<br/>
(Fukuro no shiro) is nice. I'm sure some of our movie<br/>

 </span></blockquote>I must say, your style, though bizarre, is refreshing.<br/>
Kind of like Tolkein on acid. <br/>
<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Well, the job titles are pretty self-descriptive, I<br/>
should think. Care to elaborate on your question?<br/>
<br/>

 </span></blockquote>As in Europe, the more people at your beck and call<br/>
for utterly mundane things, the better off you must<br/>
have been. But sandal bearer, though it DOES relate to<br/>
setting the masters sandals out for him to step into<br/>
when he steps down from the veranda, is also a bit of<br/>
a personal attendant position. Toyotomi Hideyoshi (aka<br/>
Hashiba Hideyoshi, aka Kinoshita Tokichiro, depending<br/>
on what stage of life you want) started out as a<br/>
sandal bearer to Oda Nobunaga. <br/>

previous discussions here...<br/>
<br/>
... and Gohatto, more 'gay' than 'gentle', again with some excellent dojo fencing which <br/>
contrasts nicely with the somewhat wild 'cut n slash' of 'the real thing'.<br/>
<br/>
The Kurosawas are, of course, mandatory.<br/>
<br/>
I have heard Seven Samurai is being re-released with revised subtitling which is somewhat <br/>
more 'earthy' than the 50's version. Anyone know anything about this?<br/>

<br/>
Kitsuno, the owner of this email list, lives in<br/>
Oita-ken. Some small remote village where they still<br/>
dress like Watanabe Ken in "The Last Samurai". <br/>
<br/>
Okay, not really...but it's somewhere in Oita-ken.<br/>

I think there is a site that reprints old Japanese texts in Japanese but <br/>
I forgot the link name.<br/>
