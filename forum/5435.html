<h3>Sankin-kodai</h3>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-500157505">Hi all!<br/>
<br/>
I have read in several places about the Sankin-kodai law that was established at the beginning of the Tokugawa shugonate.<br/>
<br/>
Hadn't the family members EVER left Edo back to their provinces / Did they spend their entire lives there?<br/>
Was the Daimyo able to choose whom to deliver to Edo, or were entire families transferred?<br/>
Who would rule the province during the time the Daimyo visited Edo?<br/>
How long did the Daimyo have to stay in Edo? How often (most commonly indicated time period I found is every other year)<br/>
<br/>
Thanks,<br/>
Rami<br/>
