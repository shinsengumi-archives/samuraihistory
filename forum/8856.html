 </span></blockquote>Yeah... I was told it was going to be taken down for final<br/>
maintenance, apparently that was now, not the other night.  Oh well,<br/>
I've been told that once the maintenance/replacements are done, this<br/>

Unfortunately the database was only backed up on 6/2/06, so <br/>
everything after that was lost, and if you had signed up after the <br/>
2nd, you may have to re-sign up.  More details available directly on <br/>
the site.<br/>

Thanks!<br/>
