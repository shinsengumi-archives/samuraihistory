Anyways, update follows: After typing into a Google<br/>
search, one of the librarians found it in connection<br/>
with Ishida Mitsunari--was it his title? Anyways, one<br/>
of the hits had a yomikata for the first two kanji<br/>
(INOBE), so as far as we can figure it's either INOBE<br/>
or YABE. The second two, the consensus is SHOUHOU or<br/>
SHOUSUKE, with the latter being agreed upon as<br/>
probably correct. Maybe it's aan obscure kakikata for<br/>
the common ~suke title?? TONY, where are you??<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-2107500323">Okay, update III: What can I say, the librarian is<br/>
making a go of it--she just looked it up in some huge<br/>
rekishi dictionary, and the kanji is incorrect--it<br/>
should have the first radical in the first character<br/>
with 3 water marks (sanzui) instead of the two you<br/>
have--that makes it "osamu" and you'd read it "Jibe". <br/>

I hope you're less confused than I am...<br/>

Keep in mind Muromachi ranks and titles originate in the Heian/Kamakura <br/>

not sure how to translate it but the above should help you...<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-406095163">For some reason it lost that second mark on the upper left when I <br/>
created it, and I didn't notice -- but anyway, I found an excellent <br/>
Japanese website that explains all of the rankings, puts them in <br/>
hierarchy, and also has the readings for all of them.  That rank <br/>
is 'Jibu no Shou' (confirmed against a Japanese web search -- for <br/>
some reason, the last Kanji is 'silent' or something --not sure what <br/>
is going on there). That page even breaks down the '~no kami' <br/>
hierarchy. Apparently some provinces were more prestigious than <br/>
others to have as a title, I guess.<br/>
<br/>
Here is the site, it is a heck of a find:<br/>

Also, www.goo.ne.jp is a great resource. Be sure to check that out, <br/>
too.<br/>
