<h3>Samurai and Mikkyo</h3>
by <i>mahamayuri</i>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-421904756">Studying much of Miyamoto Musashi history<br/>
I saw that much of the samurai spirit and thinking was related with<br/>
esoteric buddhism.<br/>
<br/>
The Go Rin No Shou have much of the Maha Mandala concepts and cosmogony,<br/>
that is present in Shingon, Tendai and Shugendo Yamabushi.<br/>
<br/>
And also, it seems that Musashi himself was a serious dedicated one to Fudô<br/>
Inu Myô Ô (Sk. Ac.alanâtha Vidhyarâja - The King of Wisdom Dance of<br/>
Irremovability) and did mush shugyo (practice of austerity) being know as<br/>
The Kensei, or The Saint of the Sword.<br/>
<br/>
What people here can tell more about the relationship between Mikkyo,<br/>
Shugendo and The Way or Art of the Sword?<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Hi Mr. Oddhinsson,<br/>
<br/>
While I find your question a very interesting one I sadly can't help<br/>
but to point you to a few sources (some of which you might already be<br/>
familiar with):<br/>
<br/>
Colin Hyakutake's web page. Mr. Hyakutake trains Hyoho Niten Ichi ryu<br/>
under Imai Masayuki soke and has translated some of soke's writings<br/>
(including some info about Musashi and Buddhism) here:<br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.bunbun.ne.jp/~sword/Hyoho1.html">http://www.bunbun.ne.jp/~sword/Hyoho1.html</a><br/>
<br/>
In Koryu Bujutsu book (edited by Diane Skoss, ISBN: 1-890536-04-0,<br/>
www.koryu.com) there is an article by Mr. David A. Hall: Marishiten -<br/>
Buddhist Influences on Combative Behavior.<br/>
<br/>
At www.e-budo.com there are couple of people who could propably point<br/>
you to better sources, so you might want to try there. Mr. William<br/>
Bodiford is an associate professor in UCLA and has specialized (IIRC)<br/>
on Buddhist studies and has trained Kashima-Shinryu for a long time.<br/>
Mr. Karl Friday is a history professor in University of Georgia and<br/>
Menkyo Kaiden in Kashima-Shinryu and might also have some thing to say<br/>
about the subject.<br/>
<br/>
A little older book: Blomberg, Catharina: Samurai Religion (1977,<br/>
Uppsala University) might also have something on the subject. The book<br/>
might be quite hard to get, but maybe you could try a local University<br/>
library.<br/>
<br/>
Btw. our iaido teacher Takada Gakudo sensei is mikkyo buddhist. At<br/>
least one person who has visited him in Japan has taken part of some<br/>
of his religious practises. Takada sensei has only once briefly talked<br/>
about his religion, so I don't have much knowledge about it. Maybe<br/>
next Autumn I can find something out as I was lucky enough to get<br/>
accepted for an exchange student program and will spend a year in<br/>
Japan near where our sensei lives (yes, I know I'm a lucky bas**** :).<br/>
<br/>
Please share with us if you find something more about the subject! I<br/>
believe many are familiar with the over emphasized zen buddhist<br/>
influence in budo, while mikkyo buddhism (which propably has had more<br/>
influence) is not very well known.<br/>

Just a correction...<br/>
The Sanskrit name of Fudou Myou is<br/>
Ac.alanâtha Vidyaraja (the "c" would be with the dot bellow it, but I don't<br/>
have the font for the romanized sanskrit accents)<br/>
<br/>
Sorry for my mystype. *blushes*<br/>

	You are very lucky indeed. I lived and practiced in Kamakura <br/>
for a few years and my teacher and Takada Sensei are friends. I had <br/>
the chance to practice with Takada Sensei a few times and it was <br/>
always rewarding. It's not until next year but if you remember give <br/>
my best to Sensei, Rumi Sensei and everyone there in Yokohama.<br/>
