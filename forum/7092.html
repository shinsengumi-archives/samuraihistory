 </span></blockquote>If I hear someone has made a documentary about Auschwitz and a key publicized <br/>
contributor to the documentary was a famous Holocaust-debunker, I wouldn't have <br/>
to see the video to know that it's likely crap. Or, at least, it contains more <br/>
crap (in this case, any unit over "one") than I care to see.<br/>
<br/>
Don't you get it? In anything that claims to be a *real* documentary or history <br/>
of ninja, *mentioning* Hayes can be done -- in the context of fraud and total <br/>
bogusness. But to use him as one of the sources and actually present him as one <br/>
automatically makes the film suspect.<br/>
<br/>
It's the job of the producers to make people want to see it, and as a historian <br/>
specializing in Japan's military history, I find the inclusion of Hayes in *any* <br/>
documentary suspect. I have no interest in seeing it. It's not *my* fault I <br/>
don't trust him or anything connected with him. It's the producers who made that <br/>
choice.<br/>
