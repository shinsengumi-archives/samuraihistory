	Pretty cool stuff. I would want to know a few things before bidding <br/>
though; How many pages does this book contain? How many illustrations <br/>
are there? Are we seeing the only ones? Do you read Japanese? If this <br/>
is written in "cryptic" language do you have the resources to translate <br/>
it? Do you even care what it says? What is the title of the book? Who <br/>
published it? Is this info unavailable in more modern texts? If you are <br/>
a book collector then alot of this won't matter; you only need to <br/>
compare it to similar things on offer down in Kanda and you've already <br/>
said something like this has never come up...<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1534338183">Tom and Edy,<br/>
<br/>
Thank you very much for your help full tips and time spent reviewing my questions!<br/>
<br/>
I emailed the people at www.auctionukiyoe.com with some questions.<br/>
<br/>
It seems as this hand-written/hand-painted Edo period manuscript contains 146 pages, of <br/>
which 88 contains illustrations. And a lot (all?) is written in non cursive characters and <br/>
therefore should be fairly easily translated into English.<br/>
<br/>
Edy suggested I should do some translation However as I have very limited spare time due <br/>
to our heavy "Japanese style" workload. I do not want to have the responsibility . Maybe <br/>
some other member with more time could acquire this item and do a more in depth study? <br/>
<br/>
The bid is only $ 80 (a major bargain!) so I think nearly anybody can afford it? I would love <br/>
to own the manuscript and add it to my collection, but due to time constraints I could not <br/>
share the info contained therein with other people. I feel somebody who would be more <br/>
serious about doing the research would be the proper custodian of this artwork.<br/>
<br/>
Anybody have an idea of who the author /samurai Teijo could be? <br/>
<br/>
Does anybody know about similar manuscripts in any of the major museums or libraries? I <br/>
have checked the most obvious references, such as British Museum, British Library aso., <br/>
but I haven't been able to find anything similar.<br/>

Anders,<br/>
It's a shame that the auction site doesn't show the cover, or give <br/>
the title and author's name in Japanese. That would make it a lot <br/>
easier to look into this manuscript.<br/>
<br/>
Just to note - the price is listed as 80 _British pounds_, not 80 US <br/>
dollars. That would make it about 150 US dollars.<br/>
<br/>
>Anybody have an idea of who the author /samurai Teijo could be? <br/>
<br/>
Sorry - not me. There was a relatively recent haiku poet named <br/>
Nakamura Teijo &#20013;&#26449;&#27712;&#22899; but it's certainly not the same person. :)<br/>
