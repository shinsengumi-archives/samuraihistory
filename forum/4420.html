<h3>Family serving Lord Maeda in Kanazawa</h3>
by <i>eischenfamily04</i>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1001317451">It has been told to me that my ancestors served Lord Maeda in <br/>
Kanazawa. They were Samurai, some were falconers. I would like to <br/>
know how I can confirm this and how I can find some sort of written <br/>
history of the families who served Lord Maeda.(if there are any) <br/>
 Shamefully I do not speak japanese so I am at a loss as to where to <br/>
look besides the japanese sites.<br/>
 The names of my ancestors are Tomiyoshi Uno, Ryu Uno, Takuo Uno, <br/>
Mahiko Uno, Masamichi and Miyuki Uno, Kumemaro Uno, Yukio Uno, <br/>
Mitsuchika Uno, Toru Uno, Yoshiko Uno, Masu (Uno) Domoto, Tome Uno, <br/>
Tsuru Uno... Tome was the third wife of Tomimoto... Tsuru Sassa is <br/>
the mother of Ryu.<br/>
 All are burried at Nodayama.<br/>
 Any help you can give me will be greatly appreciated. Thank you in <br/>
advance and thank you for taking the time to read this.<br/>
       Sincerly, M. Uno-Eischen</div>

Maybe this is some help.<br/>
