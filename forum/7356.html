<h3>Leeds Royal Armouries Shogun seminars & activities</h3>

<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-44454462">I believe Kitsuno has already posted regarding the Shogun exhibition <br/>
currently on at the Leeds Royal Armouries in the UK.<br/>
<br/>
The Armouries is holding a professional seminar on August 17th on <br/>
Japanese arms & armour collection and display. From the Armouries <br/>
website:<br/>
"Aimed at Museum professionals with Japanese arms and armour <br/>
collections, the sessions will include guidance on identification, <br/>
conservation, and display. Attendees will be able to see Shogun and <br/>
receive an exhibition catalogue as part of their ticket price. Must be <br/>
pre-booked."<br/>
<br/>
In addition, the Armouries are putting on displays of yabusame every <br/>
Wednesday and Thursday as well as demonstrations of calligraphy, <br/>
suiboku and ikebana, amongst other things.<br/>
<br/>
A family oriented sleep-over event is scheduled for August 13th.<br/>
<br/>
I'll be visiting the exhibition this week and I'll post with details.</div>
