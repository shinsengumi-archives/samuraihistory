<h3>Need to find a certain Samurai</h3>

<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1802243921">Hi Group. I'm new here, just for the purpose of some light research. <br/>
<br/>
Could anyone help me find a Samurai by the following description: <br/>
<br/>
  - Lived before 1750<br/>
  - Was the major hero / contributor to the DEFENSE of a particular <br/>
    village / household etc. <br/>
  - Basically, if he disappeared just before a certain time, a lot of <br/>
    people would be in trouble without him. <br/>
<br/>
If you are aware of this certain Samurai who saved the village / <br/>
household, and feel like educating me, any information you wish to <br/>
provide would be very helpful. Terminology, names, place, times, etc. <br/>
would all be helpful as well. However, I realize that I am asking for <br/>
one of probably a thousand needles in a haystack, so if you just <br/>
provide a Samurai's name, that would be a huge help all by itself. <br/>
<br/>
Thank you very much. <br/>
