<h3>Replica of armor?</h3>
by <i>midorinotoradesu</i>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1636743807">I have a friend who picked up a suit of armor from a local Japanese <br/>
antique shop.  He would like to know if anyone can verify if its <br/>
original or replica.  I think it's a replica but I'm no expert.  When <br/>
he bought it, someone had spray painted it red.  Now he's going <br/>
through the process of removing the paint.  He found that the <br/>
underlayer is gold.  Looks very much like a replica shown in Tony's <br/>
book The Samurai (Osprey).  Please let me know what you think. <br/>

 </span></blockquote>YEs, it's a replica. It's a copy (more or less) of one of Ieyasu's two "gold" <br/>
armours.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-756377574">Thanks Tony.  I figured but he did get for a good price.  I figure <br/>
Y60000 isn't bad, even for a replica.  He was very concerned with <br/>
"restoring" it to original condition.  Although I thought he was a <br/>
little silly at first, I think it's added some value as a project for <br/>
him.  It's kind of like when I used to dig for dinosaur bones in the <br/>
backyard.  I'd find a dogbone and get excited.  It was fun and had <br/>
some entertainment value.  His project is just a little cooler than <br/>
mine was. ;p<br/>
