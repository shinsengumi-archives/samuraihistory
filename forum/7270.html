<br/>
Tsukudajima is a neighborhood unlike any other in Tokyo. It survived <br/>
unscathed the Great Kanto Earthquake and the fire bombings of World <br/>
War II, but other pockets of the city share that good fortune. What <br/>
sets Tsukudajima apart is the sense of community that has survived <br/>
for four centuries. <br/>
<br/>
Originally a grassy island at the estuary of the Sumidagawa river, <br/>
it was settled at the beginning of the Edo Period (1603-1867), at <br/>
the invitation of Tokugawa Ieyasu, by a group of fishermen from <br/>
Osaka whose descendants still fish the waters of Tokyo Bay. They <br/>
called it Tsukudajima, an area that roughly corresponds to Tsukuda 1-<br/>
chome. <br/>
<br/>
Tsunenari Tokugawa, 18th Head of the Tokugawa Shogunal Household, <br/>
looks at least 10 years younger than his 65 years. For 38 of those <br/>
years he worked at Nippon Yusen Kaisha (NYK Line), but retired as <br/>
vice president two years ago to devote his time and energy to <br/>
establishing the Tokugawa Memorial Foundation. <br/>
<br/>
"Do you mind if I smoke?" he asks, sitting in his NYK office, where <br/>
he still works as a consultant. "This is the only room in the whole <br/>
building where smoking is still permitted," he says and <br/>
shrugs. "Executive privilege," he says with a smile. <br/>
<br/>
Tokugawa explains that Ieyasu once needed to visit a shrine in the <br/>
Osaka area, but the trip was made difficult because of a flood. <br/>
Fishermen from a nearby village, Tsukudamura, provided boats and <br/>
provisions and helped him reach the shrine. Ieyasu was grateful for <br/>
their help and when he moved into Fushimi Castle, he asked them to <br/>
provide fresh fish to the castle. <br/>
<br/>
After he became shogun and began to govern, Ieyasu invited the <br/>
fishermen to Edo, gave them the island, which they named <br/>
Tsukudajima, and granted them fishing rights to all of Edo Bay. He <br/>
asked them to provide fresh fish every day to Edo Castle, <br/>
particularly shirauo, whitebait. <br/>
<br/>
"They brought virtually all of them to the castle and this continued <br/>
for 260 years," Tokugawa says. <br/>
<br/>
The Tsukudajima people were still providing shirauo to the Tokugawa <br/>
family after the start of the Meiji Era (1868-1912). <br/>
<br/>
"On March 1, four or five representatives of the Tsukudajima people <br/>
come to my home to present a quantity of shirauo," Tokygawa <br/>
says. "It is a small, transparent fish that turns white when you <br/>
cook it. Very delicious," he says. "Especially as tempura. That's <br/>
how my wife fixes it for me." <br/>
<br/>
"But, alas, no shirauo are left in Tokyo Bay," he says. "The last <br/>
were caught, I believe, in the late 1950s. Since then they've been <br/>
going to Tsukiji fish market to get the best shirauo they could <br/>
find." <br/>
<br/>
On a more hopeful note Tokugawa says that the water quality in the <br/>
bay has improved tremendously and that researchers have succeeded in <br/>
hatching shirauo. "If that fish comes back to Tokyo Bay it will be a <br/>
victorious day for the ecology." <br/>
<br/>
"This is not a dream," he adds. "Some sushi-quality fish you get now <br/>
come from Tokyo Bay. I'm crossing my fingers that someday the <br/>
shirauo will be back." <br/>
<br/>
Tsukudajima still retains the slow-paced atmosphere of a rural <br/>
fishing village. The houses, many of which are superb examples of <br/>
mokuzo kaoku, traditional wooden timbered structures, are crowded <br/>
together with only narrow passageways between them. A few long-<br/>
handled water pumps, which still work, are scattered throughout the <br/>
neighborhood. Docked at a rickety peer in a canal off the river are <br/>
several fishing vessels and a traditional yakatabune, a tatami-<br/>
floored party boat, which can be hired out for special occasions. <br/>
<br/>
The small neighborhood is bordered on two sides by nine towering <br/>
apartment buildings, with more on the way. But if you turn your back <br/>
on the high-rises and look toward the river, nothing looms on the <br/>
horizon. <br/>
<br/>
The heart of the neighborhood embraces a post office, a liquor <br/>
store, a barber shop, and a general store that sells everything from <br/>
scrubbing powder and dishwashing liquid to jump ropes and penny <br/>
candy-100 kinds that attract a constant parade of neighborhood kids. <br/>
<br/>
These shops have been run by their respective families for <br/>
generations. The neighborhood also boasts three shops that <br/>
specialize in tsukudani, an Edo-Period delicacy. <br/>
<br/>
Tsukudani is a salty-sweet preserve of tiny fish, shrimp, shellfish, <br/>
seaweed, or other edibles that have been simmered in soy sauce, <br/>
sugar and salt. Often eaten as a topping on rice, tsukudani <br/>
originated in Tsukudajima. <br/>
<br/>
Kenji Kobayashi, the voluble sixth-generation proprietor of Marukyu, <br/>
a tsukudani shop open since 1859, stands behind his small counter <br/>
lined with red lacquer boxes containing various types of tsukudani. <br/>
<br/>
"Each item is simmered for three or four hours in a huge iron pot," <br/>
he says, spreading his arms apart, "large enough for two men to <br/>
stand inside." <br/>
<br/>
His tsukudani is made exactly the way it's always been made, he <br/>
points out. The exact balance of salty and sweet is a secret varying <br/>
from shop to shop. "We make new batches every two to three days <br/>
depending on what's needed," he says. <br/>
<br/>
"Once all our raw material came from Tokyo Bay," he says, gesturing <br/>
toward the river. "The fish, the seaweed, the shrimp-but now only <br/>
asari (clams) come from the bay." <br/>
<br/>
The apartment towers don't seem to bother him much. "We've got three <br/>
generations of customers coming here," Kobayashi says. "Even those <br/>
new apartment buildings are not bad for us. Many young people are <br/>
living there and some of them come in to try our tsukudani." <br/>
<br/>
There are two other old tsukudani shops on the same street, Tenyasu <br/>
and Tsukugen Tanakaya, each in business for about 160 years. <br/>
<br/>
Another member of the community is Yasuhide Nakajima, an 11th-<br/>
generation master craftsman of Edo-style lacquer work. <br/>
<br/>
"My ancestors started in Nihonbashi at the time of Tokugawa Iemitsu, <br/>
more than 300 years ago," says the 61-year-old artisan. <br/>
<br/>
The war destroyed his family workshop. About 40 years ago his father <br/>
moved the atelier to Tsukudajima. The old wooden shack that serves <br/>
as his workshop is perhaps the oldest building in the neighborhood. <br/>
<br/>
One of Nakajima's best-selling items is eight-sided chopsticks made <br/>
from teak or purple rosewood. "These chopsticks will last 20 years," <br/>
he says. "And I'll repair them for free, if they need it." <br/>
<br/>
"I make real things," says Nakajima. <br/>
<br/>
His family is famous for the luminous dakkanshitsu (Japanese sweets <br/>
dish). It is painstakingly crafted layer by layer of hemp linen, <br/>
washi paper and coatings of red lacquer. Creating a set of five <br/>
takes three years. <br/>
<br/>
Lacquer painting is a tedious process. "It's paint-dry-paint-dry," <br/>
Nakajima says. "You brush on one coat of lacquer and that's it for <br/>
the day," he says with a grin. "Young people don't have the patience <br/>
for this kind of work." <br/>
<br/>
Patience is most important, stresses Nakajima. It takes time to make <br/>
something strong, beautiful, and useful-until aji ga deru, the <br/>
deeper quality, is revealed. <br/>
<br/>
Something similar, perhaps, happens to neighborhoods. Four centuries <br/>
of remembrance and appreciation have helped to define the unique <br/>
sense of community that thrives in Tsukudajima. <br/>
<br/>
High-rise by high-rise, the city slowly encroaches on Tsukudajima, <br/>
but life still goes on pretty much as it has for generations. <br/>
<br/>
A tofu peddler, a young man in baggy jeans and a baseball cap, pulls <br/>
a cart through the narrow alleyways and occasionally blows two <br/>
forlorn notes on a small brass horn announcing fresh tofu for sale. <br/>
A housewife stops him to purchase something for the evening meal. <br/>
Then he is on his way again-his tune floating on the evening air. <br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I am reading a book written by Tokugawa Munefusa who is 11th  Head of <br/>
the Tayasu Tokugawa Household.<br/>
The book is called "Secret stories of Tokugawa 400 years"<br/>
For example,<br/>
"Ieyasu liked Shingen, didn'like Nobunaga" <br/>
"Hideyoshi and Ieyasu went pee together before attacking Odawara castle.<br/>
"Young Nobunaga was a punk"<br/>
"Shingen's love letter to the boy"<br/>
"Tsukudajima fishermen were sea ninja"<br/>
<br/>
Nothing really secret but fun to read.</div>
