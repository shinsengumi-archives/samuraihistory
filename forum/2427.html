<div id="ygrps-yiv-2094521929">how does one trace their family history a samurai. I am new at this <br/>
and could use a little guidence. when my father was young, (he's <br/>
approaching 70) the japanese consulate gave him 2 samurai dolls as <br/>
he was the eldest son of the eldest son etc. decendant of 2 <br/>
different samurai. WWII came and he had to abandon most of his <br/>
posessions including the dolls. He was sent to manzanar. I thought <br/>
it would be nice to trace his history back to to those samurai and <br/>
give the info to him for his 70th birthday. Can anyone help me? His <br/>
fathers name was will kumagai. thanks</div>
