<div id="ygrps-yiv-108981190">Hey.<br/>
       If memory serves, Saito Dosan was either an uncle to Toshitada or his <br/>
father.  Somewhere, and I do not remember where, I thought I read that Saito <br/>
Dosan married his son to Akechi Mitsuhide's sister.  But I do not recall <br/>
exactly if and where I read it.  And it may have been that they were not related at <br/>
all -- just my faulty memory playing trix on me again.  Hope this helps.  :-)  <br/>
Later.<br/>

<h3>Re: Saito Toshitada</h3>
by <i>kitsuno</i>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1080937673">This is all I know:<br/>
<br/>
Saito Toshitada married the daughter of Akechi Mitsutsuna (I.E. <br/>
Mitsukuni), who also happened to be Akechi Mitsuhide's father.  I <br/>
don't have any dates for the births or deaths of the sister or <br/>
Toshitada, and the only reference I can find to him was the fact <br/>
that he was the father of Saito Toshimitsu and married to Akechi <br/>
Mitsuhide's younger sister.  My Sengoku Samurai biographical <br/>
dictionary only lists him as Saito Toshimitsu's father.  The Rekishi <br/>
Gunzo book on Akechi Mitsuhide has info on him in the Chosokabe <br/>
section, but I don't actually own that book, I just took some quick <br/>
notes out of it with my palm pilot at the Japanese bookstore (so if <br/>
anyone has it, take a look for me).  I'm sure he is related to Saito <br/>
Dosan, but just not sure how, probably a son, but not sure. <br/>

<h3>Re: Saito Toshitada</h3>
by <i>kitsuno</i>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-925491457">Now I'm confused - it says here in plain Japanese for Saito <br/>
Toshimitsu 'Toshitada's son, mother is akechi mitsuhide's younger <br/>
sister' It says he (Toshimitsu) was born in 1534.  Now since <br/>
Mitsuhide was born in 1526, by the mathematics that would mean that <br/>
his 'younger' sister would have to be born after 1526, making her at <br/>
best 8 years old at the birth of her son Toshimitsu....  <br/>
<br/>
Can someone clear this all up?!?!<br/>

<br/>
I have the Rekishi Gunzo book on Akechi Mitsuhide, and here is what the<br/>
family tree on page 172-173 says;<br/>
<br/>
Saito Toshitaka (not Toshitada; that's the way my Japanese shutome says its<br/>
pronounced) is married to an aunt  Akechi, who is only identified as onna.<br/>
Her sister (and Akechi's aunt) Komigata is married to Saito Dosan. I guess<br/>
that would make Toshitada a kind of brother-in-law(?).</div>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-432164343">"Aunt" Akechi - meaning it says that it is akechi mitsuhide's aunt <br/>
who is married to Toshitada?  My sengoku biographical dictionary <br/>
says it is Mitsuhide's younger (Imouto) sister. (making Toshimitsu <br/>
Mitsuhide's nephew)  Like I said, if you've got a scanner.... I had <br/>
to take notes with my palm pilot at the bookstore.  I can't afford <br/>
to spend $30 on what amounts to only 2 pages of info that I need!<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-426587627">That's what it says. It lists 8 children to Mitsusugu, Mitsuhide's<br/>

Sorry I don't have a scanner! I could photocopy them and mail you it. The<br/>

Which is also what my Sengoku biographical dictionary says - that <br/>
his mother was Mitsuhide's younger sister, and father was toshitada. <br/>
But like we've said before, the math doesn't make sense....<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-2000743254">Well like I said this is only what the Rekishi Gunzo book says. I would be a<br/>
tad suspicious of most of those family trees. I have heard of many<br/>
inconsistencies and unresolved questions; for example; the mother of<br/>
Tokugawa Iesada-some people claim she was on orphan found on the street.<br/>
Remember most of these were compiled in the 17th century. Some were doctored<br/>
to create enhanced lineages to famous Samurai. Its not hard to believe,<br/>
before the event of modern genealogy, that some where slapped together<br/>
without being too careful of the facts. while others might have been<br/>
deliberately changed either to hide a skeleton in the closet (or take one<br/>
out in the case of the enemy.)</div>
