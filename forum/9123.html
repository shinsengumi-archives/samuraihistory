provided by "T" (thanks again)In 1543, a Chinese ship carrying <br/>
Portuguese traders wrecked on the island of Tanegashima. The local <br/>
lord, Tanegashima Tokitaka, purchased two matchlocks from the <br/>
Portuguese, and ordered a local blacksmith to begin producing copies. <br/>
Soon these "Tanegashimajû" were in great demand among warring armies <br/>
all over Japan - both the original copies, and copies of the copies. <br/>
The Tanegashima-style matchlock would prove its worth definitively at <br/>
the Battle of Nagashino in 1575, when Oda Nobunaga's army of lowly <br/>
ashigaru used Tanegashima guns to devastate the Takeda samurai and <br/>
their fabled cavalry charge.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1522918997">FIREARMS, INTRODUCTION OF<br/>
Teppo Denrai<br/>
Firearms were introduced to Japan by Portuguese castaways on the  <br/>
island of Tanegashima, off Kyushu, in 1543. The Japanese may have had  <br/>
some basic knowledge of explosive weapons before the Portuguese  <br/>
arrived, but the introduction of European firearms marked the  <br/>
beginning of widespread use of such weapons.<br/>
Portuguese harquebuses greatly impressed the daimyo Tanegashima  <br/>
Tokitaka, who ordered his craftsmen to duplicate them. Many Japanese  <br/>
warlords hastened to master the techniques for producing them. As  <br/>
early as 1549 Oda Nobunaga bought 500 matchlocks from gunsmiths in  <br/>
Kunitomo in Omi (now Shiga Prefecture) and established a firearms  <br/>
brigade in his army. In the 1550s Takeda Shingen, lord of the  <br/>
province of Kai (now Yamanashi Prefecture), also organized a firearms  <br/>
unit.<br/>
By the late 16th century firearms (teppo) had become the most  <br/>
important offensive weapon; perhaps a third of the daimyo armies of  <br/>
the 1570s carried guns. Oda Nobunaga used his firearms units to  <br/>
advantage in the Battle of Anegawa in 1570 and in the Battle of  <br/>
Nagashino in 1575. Toyotomi Hideyoshi also supplied his troops with  <br/>
firearms, which he used during his campaigns against the Shimazu  <br/>
family of Kyushu in 1586 and against the Later Hojo family in the  <br/>
Odawara Campaign in 1590.<br/>
The spread of firearms helped to stimulate industrial and commercial  <br/>
activities by creating an increased demand for muskets, ammunition,  <br/>
and other matériel. Also, the popularization of firearms, together  <br/>
with the establishment of an armed infantry, largely recruited from  <br/>
the peasantry, promoted social mobility. (Kodansha)<br/>
<br/>
I Hope it helps!<br/>

The matchlocks that the Japanese acquired from<br/>
Portugal was called in Japanese a Teppo. They soon<br/>
began making copies that where somewhat better then<br/>
what they received from the Spanish and Portugal. The<br/>
first user of Machlocks in mass was the Ikko-Ikki. as<br/>
for makers, well Look to the main spanish arsenals.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-165045086">Yours is a very interesting question. I would say that there is more a<br/>
provenience rather then a brand-name, and<br/>
I've been puzzled by this for years and still are. My former Senpai, now<br/>
passed away, was making a study assuming that the<br/>
Portugueses made those arquebuses in Goa or possibly Macau. Cannons at that<br/>
time had a limied lifespan. Each 100 rounds (signed on the barrel, ten<br/>
rounds one nick) the cannon should have been re-melted and casted (we're<br/>
talking about bronze, not steel). Transporting such valuable items from<br/>
Indonesia to Portugal was expensive and dangerous so the portugueses<br/>
settled foundries in both the above mentioned colonies. Such foundries<br/>
provided even metal items for the chinese and indian market.<br/>
Now, is it belivable that the portugueses established arquebuses factories<br/>
there too ? Fabrizio was collecting evidences, but he passed away before to<br/>
finish the work and his widow lost the notes and bibliography. I've never<br/>
had neither the time nor the knowledge to re-create the files. Might be, if<br/>
he was right, that arquebuses equipping the men that shipwrecked on<br/>
Tanegashima were made in Goa or Macau, possibly in factories managed by<br/>
portuguese commercial company,<br/>
but I can't really consider this other then a possibility NOT supported by<br/>
evidences.<br/>

Go-henji domo arigato gozaimasu. I undesrtood the original question <br/>
to be a request for background rather than for vocabulary or "brand" <br/>
names. I felt that Tanegashima would lead the questioner to Teppo, <br/>
Tobidogu, Taiho and all the other firearms of Japan and hopefully <br/>
allow him (and others) to find it all out on his own.<br/>
   From the many informative messages following mine it would seem <br/>
that my brevity was not misunderstood or without point.<br/>
at least I hope so...<br/>

<h3>Re: R: [samuraihistory] maker???</h3>
by <i>couchtr26</i>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1944607507">I do not mean to intrude on this topic but am new to the <br/>
group.  First, I understand that the Japanese matchlock is refered <br/>
to as a Teppo.  However, matchlocks don't have brand names or <br/>
makers.  There manufacturing predates mass production.  It should <br/>
also be noted that they are of Tanegashima pattern.  Matchlocks are <br/>
known by pattern names.  English pattern or French pattern, this is <br/>
just how they are named and identified.  <br/>
<br/>
     The main reason I wanted to post, however, is the reason that <br/>
makes a Tanegashima pattern so interesting.  There was a very small <br/>
but at the same time big change that people seem to miss.  These <br/>
matchlocks were the first in which the serpentine fell forward.  <br/>
This was a big improvement.  Older matchlocks the serpentine fell <br/>
towards the shooter, this could result in some serious problems.  <br/>
Burns, blindness, etc. were not uncommon results from this setup.  <br/>
As of now, since all firearms have a hammer that falls forward in <br/>
the direction of the muzzle, these should be noted as the genesis of <br/>
virtually all modern firearms design.  Also, they have very fine <br/>
lines and are nice to shoot.  Reproductions, to be exact, are what I <br/>
have fired.  I'm not a matchlock fan but if I was going to have one <br/>
it would be of Tanegashima pattern.  <br/>
<br/>
     Furthermore, I think there was someone who posted about Chinese <br/>
weapons.  It was not until Europeans came that they showed Asian <br/>
cultures, that if you harnessed the power of gunpowder you could <br/>
make nasty weapons.  Also, it should be noted that Japanese guns are <br/>
of comparable quality to European guns of this period.  Most others <br/>
from Asia were considered of poor quality or overly ornate, not <br/>
considered worth general use.  <br/>
<br/>
     Anyway, I'm a firearms guy.  The gun is such a curious and <br/>
elusive thing especially in these early days.  I thought I should <br/>
add, I believe someone earlier in this thread mentioned cannons, <br/>
that they were first produced by bell makers.  Fun little trivial <br/>
fact, I always found that one a good surprise for those who don't <br/>
understand the reason why.</div>
