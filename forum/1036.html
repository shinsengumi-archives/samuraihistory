<h3>Eta hinin executioners</h3>
by <i>chrissteel25</i>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1387005512">Can anyone help?  I have a Wak which is very heavy.  It has been put <br/>
in some made up carved wooden mounts for the tourist market in about <br/>
1900.  I am about to clean the blade and add lemon juice but I don't <br/>
think a hamon will be visible as its condition is quite bad.  It has <br/>
no signiture and might be from the 19th/18th century as it's blade is <br/>
broader than a Koto blade.  Did the Eta Hinin executioners use extra <br/>
heavy Waks for the job?  I am puzzled as this Wak seems very heavy <br/>
but doesn't seem to give any clues as to its origin or period, not to <br/>
a novice like myself anyway.  Can anyone help?  There is only on hole <br/>
in the tang and there are file marks going diagonaly across the tang <br/>
from the back of the tang towards the blade edge (suji-chigai).  The <br/>
blade lenght is 16 and a half inches (21 and a quater from Kisaki to <br/>
the Kata-yamagata). Shinogi-zukuri.  No grain is visible.  Anyone <br/>
help please!<br/>
Regards,<br/>

    I suggest that lemon juice is not a good idea if this is a true nihonto.<br/>
If you had pictures I would be happy to have a look or you could post them<br/>
at a webhosting site and send the link to: <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="mailto:nihonto@yahoogroups.com">nihonto@yahoogroups.com</a><br/>
<br/>
Where there are many who could give you help. I know of no "executioner's"<br/>
weapons but some odd forms were produced over the years. Hard to say from<br/>
your description.<br/>
