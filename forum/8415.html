 </span></blockquote>James, Angel et al -<br/>
	I would have to disagree with the above. Though the policy of  <br/>
isolation was Bakufu policy, the Tokugawa government was more engaged  <br/>
with and better informed of the outside world that the Imperial court  <br/>
in 1853. For years they had traded with the Dutch, kept up on  <br/>
developments in Europe and even sponsored schools of Western studies.<br/>
	After the coming of Perry, they were loathe to trade with the West  <br/>
but saw few alternatives, they chose to accomodate the Foreign powers  <br/>
until they could stand on equal footing and perhaps drive them out.  <br/>
(No one in Japan really wanted the Foreigners there) The Court  <br/>
however, insisted that the Bakufu fulfill its mandate and immediately  <br/>
drive them out. When they chose not to do so, many in the country saw  <br/>
this as treason against the emperor and perhaps sensing weakness  <br/>
began calling for the expulsion of Foreigners and the Restoration of  <br/>
the Emperor.<br/>
	Many of the most xenophobic Shishi did not live to see the  <br/>
Restoration, those that did had to either adapt or be left behind. In  <br/>
the end the pragmatists within the new government chose the same  <br/>
policy as that of the Tokugawa; to accomodate the Foreigners, learn  <br/>
all that they could from the West and then use Western technology to  <br/>
drive the barbarians out. They nearly succeed, but by the time of the  <br/>
Great Pacific War their dream had become so twisted, and they so  <br/>
corrupt it could never last.<br/>
	You are forgetting BTW, my favorite, Hitokiri Hanjiro, who later  <br/>
became known as Kirino Toshiaki...<br/>
