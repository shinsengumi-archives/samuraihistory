<br/>
I too was once an archaeologist working a lot in lincoln Uk where i live now.<br/>
I worked on Lincoln castle, and while reopening the west gate in 1988 we<br/>
discovered the remains of the roman city boundry wall directly underneath the<br/>
castle gate. We knew it was there as previous excavations had unearthed one of<br/>
the roman gateways. <br/>
<br/>
it seems that the normans had used the roman wall as part of the foundations.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
I recently videoed a discovery channel program on the samurai and it had a lot<br/>
on Himeji castle. i forget the weight of the wooden structure but the<br/>
foundations for the castle must be amazing. Maybe that is one of the reasons<br/>
for the huge mound then to face it with huge boulders. the more reienforcement<br/>
you have the more weight it can take on top. It also seems Himeji has a wood<br/>
beam running vertical inside o fthe wood structure to stop it collapsing in<br/>
the even of an earth quake.<br/>
