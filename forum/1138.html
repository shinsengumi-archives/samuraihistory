<div id="ygrps-yiv-419160218">Hello,<br/>
<br/>
I read that Emperor Gotoba became a priest/monk when he turned 23 <br/>
years old.  I also understand that the Emperor was seen as a "divine <br/>
man."  <br/>
The name or title of Ji-Kyu seems to apply to priests in Gotoba's day <br/>
and even today.<br/>
Is it possible that Emperor Gotoba could have gone by the title of <br/>
Ji-Kyu Ichi?  (Meaning "Number one Priest"?)<br/>
 Thank you for your help, Jim</div>
