<div id="ygrps-yiv-1832661812">Hallo, Gabriel.<br/>
	I came to feel that delaying my response would be rude, so I looked that<br/>
site over... and came to the unsurprising conclusion that I'd have to handle<br/>
some of the smiths' work before I could make a judgement.  It looks good,<br/>
and the hamon appear to be real on the blades they're describing as real<br/>
(this is promising, since possibly the single fastest indicator of a<br/>
poor-quality reproduction katana is the acid-etched fake hamon most of 'em<br/>
come equipped with), but I don't know anyone who's worked with any of those<br/>
blades, and images are not an adequate way to judge a blade.<br/>
<br/>
(Truly, I don't think it's wise to buy any sword without handling first.<br/>
Some mass-produced blades, assuming you've handled a representative<br/>
sampling, might be worth taking the chance on.  ...I can think of the del<br/>
Tin family in Milano, for example, and K&K Arts in Prague, whose quality and<br/>
consistency have generally pleased me... but at that, I've even had to<br/>
return a del Tin, once, and I find I have to regrind the K&K blades myself<br/>
in order to get appropriate balance and handling.  But then, European-style<br/>
swords are a great deal more forgiving about regrinding.  It's not a level<br/>
of blade-work I wish to undertake on the polishing job of a decent katana.)<br/>
<br/>
But individual swords are... well, awfully individual.  I had no intention<br/>
of getting my first Chen "Musashi"; it simply informed me that it was my<br/>
sword and it was going home with me. It was not the first sword I'd ever<br/>
bonded with, to be sure, but it was the first one that felt as though it was<br/>
bonding with me, it was damned well going to be my sword, and I might as<br/>
well get used to it:  and all this on my first drawing of the blade at that.<br/>
It wasn't even the first of that model I handled (bearing in mind that the<br/>
swords in that model vary so greatly that I have yet to see two that will<br/>
fit the same scabbard). It felt not unlike the sensation of a cat deciding<br/>
that you're its person.<br/>
<br/>
And for those of you who are into the names, that sword is named Abayo.  I<br/>
do not guarantee my spelling of it, but that's "'Bye" as I hear Mifune's<br/>
pronunciation.  Its partner - again, assuming I've heard the phrase and<br/>
reproduced it correctly - is Kochira-e, or "This way, please."  (After all,<br/>
you can't try and reconstruct Musashi's niten-ichi without a pair of<br/>
katana.) Swords tend to acquire names around me, although given my sense of<br/>
their personalities, it would almost be more surprising if they didn't.<br/>
<br/>
...I'd be delighted for anybody's correction on what I've heard and<br/>
transliterated, by the way.  The best of my linguistic information here is<br/>
no better than second-hand.<br/>
<br/>
If anyone else is familiar with these blades, they may be able to provide<br/>
you with a more direct answer.  But the above, for what it's worth, are my<br/>
thoughts on the matter.  If those thoughts are not my clearest at present,<br/>
my apologies; please be so kind as to blame whatever small life form is<br/>
working out its karma against my immune system.  All things considered, at<br/>
the moment I'm glad you're not planning to buy a blade on my recommendation!<br/>
Blessings & good faring,<br/>
	Gereg<br/>

  Hello Gereg,<br/>
<br/>
  I'm sorry I rushed to write about that site, because on further<br/>
examination, I have discovered that it is a fake. My mistake...Thank<br/>
you for helping me and tell me what do you think of this site:<br/>
www.jidai.jp, although I'm having difficulties at this time buying a<br/>
300 Euros sword...So the site is just a dream, besides, since I don't<br/>
take any Kendo or any alike, I wouldn't know what to do with a sword,<br/>
but to admire its beauty.</div>
