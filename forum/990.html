I Think you are talking about the battle of nagakute i believe, yes, the winner was Ieyasu, but after that, he submitted to Hideyoshiï¿½s authority, but this for practical reasons that surely you know.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1535370210">Nagakute, 1584 (?) Tactically, it was a victory for<br/>
the Tokugawa, as they destroyed the force that was<br/>
sent under Ikeda Shonyu around their lines.<br/>
Strategically, it was a draw, as both Ieyasu and<br/>
Hideyoshi realized they had much more to gain by<br/>
working together than by fighting each other. <br/>
