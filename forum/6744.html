An 11-day tour follows the activities of the Englishman who became <br/>
key adviser to the Shogun in 17th-century Japan<br/>

"Miura Anjin?" replied the print-seller as he carefully wrapped up a <br/>
19th-century woodblock image of a stopping place on the Tokaido, the <br/>
great coastal highway from Tokyo to the west. "The most famous <br/>
Englishman in Japan," he said. "Except perhaps for David Beckham."<br/>
<br/>
The soccer star's image has recently been dominating billboards and <br/>
broadcasts across the country with endorsements for cosmetics, cell <br/>
phones and chocolate. Miura Anjin, whose English name was William <br/>
Adams, died nearly four centuries ago, leaving no known image.<br/>
<br/>
In the West, what small fame Adams retains is largely due to writer <br/>
James Clavell having loosely based the character of John Blackthorne <br/>
in his blockbuster novel Shogun on him. But in Japan, Adams is <br/>
remembered as a man who brought a wider understanding of Europeans, <br/>
adopted Japanese ways to a degree few foreigners master even today <br/>
and found himself adopted in return. Of modest education, he rose to <br/>
become not only a key adviser to the ruler of a nation vastly <br/>
different from his own, but also the lord of his own manor and thus <br/>
the first foreign member of the warrior samurai class.<br/>
<br/>
Finding traces of him involves travelling to remote rural locations <br/>
that even today rarely see foreign visitors. Hong Kong-based Walk <br/>
Japan has put together an 11-day guided itinerary linking Adams's <br/>
various trading, advising and interpreting activities. The <br/>
organizers, not your run-of-the-mill tour guides, but academics who <br/>
have made a thorough study of Adams, have set out a route south from <br/>
Tokyo to small ports on the coast of the main island of Honshu, then <br/>
westward to the smaller island of Kyushu and then to tiny Hirado, <br/>
once the base for the British and Dutch traders. There's even a walk <br/>
on hidden remnants of the ancient Tokaido itself.<br/>
<br/>
Adams was largely brought up in London's Limehouse dock area and was <br/>
apprenticed as a shipwright and pilot. But navigation became his <br/>
career, and, after 10 years on ships trading with North Africa, he <br/>
became the principal pilot of a disastrous Dutch expedition to the <br/>
Spice Islands of the East Indies.<br/>
<br/>
A series of misfortunes led to the scattering or sinking of the tiny <br/>
fleet. The remaining two ships chose, in 1600, to cross the largely <br/>
uncharted and rarely sailed Pacific.<br/>
<br/>
Only Adams's ship De Liefde survived, along with a handful of its <br/>
crew. The lord of the tiny Kyushu town where the ship docked sent <br/>
Adams as spokesperson for his group to the warlord Tokugawa Ieyasu, <br/>
then attempting to gain control of the whole of Japan.<br/>
<br/>
Ieyasu had a healthy interest in foreign ideas and spent hours <br/>
interrogating Adams through an interpreter, then imprisoned him <br/>
until he decided what to do. Subsequent audiences improved both <br/>
Ieyasu's knowledge of Europe and his respect for the pilot, who was <br/>
eventually released and reunited with the remaining crew. Seeing a <br/>
future use for them, the lord had the men provided with funds and <br/>
ordered them to sail to his base at Edo, modern-day Tokyo, then <br/>
ignored them while he concentrated on winning control of Japan. The <br/>
cannon from De Liefde proved of more immediate value, helping him <br/>
clinch his final victory at the battle of Sekigahara.<br/>
<br/>
As months went by, the decrepit Dutch ship sank and the crew <br/>
scattered, suspecting that they would never be allowed to return <br/>
home. But Ieyasu had thought of other ways in which their technology <br/>
could help him. With his battles won, he awarded each man an ample <br/>
daily ration of rice and set Adams an important task.<br/>
<br/>
Our search for Adams/<br/>
<br/>
Miura began at Nihon Bashi, the central Tokyo bridge that marked the <br/>
start of the Tokaido and four other ancient highways. It was <br/>
originally built in 1603, three years after Ieyasu's victory, and <br/>
the year he was officially confirmed as de facto ruler or shogun by <br/>
a powerless and impoverished emperor.<br/>
<br/>
That year the shogun, having recognized Adams's worth as a truthful <br/>
adviser on everything foreign, gave him a town house near the new <br/>
bridge, among the warehouses and shops of Edo's rapidly developing <br/>
commercial quarter. A short walk from the current crossing, built in <br/>
1911, we found that the navigator had earned himself a place on <br/>
modern maps. In a narrow turning named Anjin-dori a small, rough-<br/>
hewn stele marked the site of his residence, mentioning that he had <br/>
instructed the shogun in gunnery, geography and mathematics.<br/>
<br/>
The next morning we boarded a southbound commuter train. At the <br/>
wealthy suburb of Taura we took a taxi to a high point overlooking a <br/>
naval base where the modern equivalents of Adams's well-armed De <br/>
Liefde wallowed. Adams had a vast estate here, on the Miura <br/>
Peninsula, given him by Ieyasu as a reward for constructing ocean-<br/>
going ships in the Western style. A path led to a thick hedge and a <br/>
stout fence surrounding the graves of Adams, his Japanese wife and <br/>
his two children by her. A memorial ceremony for Adams, held every <br/>
April, is "one of the four magnificent international events" of the <br/>
area, a sign claimed.<br/>
<br/>
A winding walk down steep residential backstreets led to the station <br/>
at Anjin-zuka (Anjin's Hill). A few minutes' ride and we disembarked <br/>
at Hemi station. Here a track, with tree-root stairways, wound over <br/>
hills, along ridge tops and down to the 13th-century Great Buddha of <br/>
Kamakura, a 13-metre-high bronze of a serene, seated figure, hands <br/>
together in its lap. In 1613 Adams came this way in the company of <br/>
John Saris, an emissary from Britain's King James, who had arrived <br/>
bearing a letter requesting trade. Saris and crew were the first <br/>
Englishmen Adams had seen since his arrival, and he brought them to <br/>
the shogun to help negotiate the privileges requested.<br/>
<br/>
A picturesque train ride west around the coastline brought us to <br/>
Ito, the site of Adams's shipbuilding efforts. The city has erected <br/>
a statue of the man: gaunt, high-cheekboned and shovel-bearded, <br/>
gesturing out to sea.<br/>
<br/>
We spent the night at a riverside inn of considerable antiquity, a <br/>
labyrinth of creaking boards, steep stairways and tatami-floored <br/>
rooms with sliding screens. We changed for the evening into cotton <br/>
yukata gowns, short haori jackets and slippers.<br/>
<br/>
When the first Europeans arrived, 50 years before Adams, the <br/>
fastidious Japanese were struck by their gaudy doublets, but <br/>
marvelled that this finery contained men so uninterested in washing. <br/>
Adams eventually submerged himself in Japanese culture and adopted <br/>
local dress. Now we did the same. We flapped our way to a basement <br/>
bathing area, scrubbing ourselves spotless before slipping into the <br/>
geothermally heated waters for a soak, then headed for a feast of <br/>
colourful dishes, mixed with liberal quantities of beer and local <br/>
sake.<br/>
<br/>
Continuing ever west, at Hatsudenshomae, a few hops by train and bus <br/>
later, we climbed one of the few remaining sections of the great <br/>
Tokaido, the main highway to the west. It snaked up the hillside <br/>
with some of its original uneven paving still in place - perhaps the <br/>
very stones Adams himself walked on many trips between the foreign <br/>
trading houses at Hirado and the capital at Edo.<br/>
<br/>
At Kyoto we visited magnificent Nijo Castle, begun by Ieyasu in <br/>
1602. Its purpose was to make his dominance over the emperor clear. <br/>
Here he was formally installed as shogun with several days of <br/>
feasting. The luxury meant to impress Japan's nobles still remains <br/>
in the vast halls with their gilded walls and screens painted with <br/>
scenes of pines, birds and tigers.<br/>
<br/>
We travelled to Miya-jima, a train and boat ride from Hiroshima, to <br/>
see the towering, orange-painted torii, or gate, which seems to <br/>
stride into the sea off the tiny island's coast. The torii, built in <br/>
1168, was ancient even when Adams passed by on his way to Kyushu. He <br/>
would have gone by ship; we took the bullet train through a tunnel <br/>
beneath Japan's Inland Sea.<br/>
<br/>
Just off Kyushu's west coast is Dejima, a fan-shaped artificial <br/>
island constructed to house foreign traders. In 1639, Ieyasu's son <br/>
Hidetada, irritated by Catholic preaching that allegiance to the <br/>
pope took precedence over feudal allegiances, banned all foreigners. <br/>
The British had already left, but the Dutch, protected because Adams <br/>
had made clear the distinction between Catholic and Protestant <br/>
teaching, were merely moved to this tiny enclave connected to Kyushu <br/>
by a single, well-guarded bridge. Some of the Dutch colony's <br/>
buildings have been re-created and fitted out as excellent museums <br/>
explaining foreigners' impact on Japan. Adams is remembered in a <br/>
picture of the departure of De Liefde from Holland in 1598.<br/>
<br/>
Our final stop was Hirado, the small island off Kyushu where Dutch <br/>
and British trading houses were first set up. Adams came to this <br/>
remote spot many times. On the hillside above the sleepy little town <br/>
and its quiet harbour we found a small, neat garden of bamboo, pines <br/>
and cycads, with a monument to 17 British merchant-adventurers. The <br/>
stone next to it was something of a surprise: "Miura Anjin's tomb." <br/>
We'd already seen his grave several hundred kilometres away, so it <br/>
seemed that even in death Adams was a traveller.<br/>
<br/>
He died on Hirado on May 26, 1620, and given Japan's summer <br/>
temperatures it seems likely that the island still has him, although <br/>
it's impossible to say for certain: After the banning of foreigners <br/>
in 1639, the remains of English mariners were disinterred and flung <br/>
into the sea. Those of Adams may not have been among them, however: <br/>
Suspiciously long bones were discovered nearby in the 1920s. Perhaps <br/>
he was left undisturbed because of his samurai status.<br/>
<br/>
In a land with few foreign heroes, Beckham's billboards will have <br/>
their day. But what greater sign of enduring respect than to have <br/>
your name carved in not one, but two tombstones?<br/>
