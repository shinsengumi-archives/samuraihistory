Jut one point which isn't really related to any of the above, but relates to<br/>
an earlier discussion. So I quoted just that one part of your post below.<br/>
<br/>
Back in the earlier thread, we were discussing the qualities of a "good"<br/>
samurai. Some people, including myself, brought up two films, AFTER THE RAIN<br/>
and SEPPUKU. I remember discussing one of the characters in SEPPUKU who had<br/>
pawned his sword blades in order to try and feed his family. According to<br/>
some historical accounts I've read, this seemed to have happened rather<br/>
frequently during the Edo period, with impoverished ronin and sometimes<br/>
low-ranked (low-paid) clan samurai pawning their sword blades, replacing<br/>
them with bamboo.  <br/>
<br/>
So with the statement cited below: can it be inferred that a samurai's sword<br/>
-- and keeping it -- would be more important to a samurai's honor than<br/>
feeding his family? That it was considered better if the samurai's family<br/>
were to starve to death rather than for the samurai to ever part with his<br/>
sword? And thus a samurai who sells his sword blades, even to keep his<br/>
family alive, is acting dishonorably?<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1185079908">Good afternoon.<br/>
Nina why do you always brings this hard to answer<br/>
questions ??? jajajaja !!!<br/>
Ok, I think that it was something philosophical and<br/>
spiritual.  <br/>
Some one once told me that there is two senses in life<br/>
that you can not ingnore : first one is when your<br/>
death time is getting close and second one is when you<br/>
are hungry !!! Then I understand why he brought out<br/>
his blades.   Katana was considered the soul of the<br/>
samurai since it was considered what ebodied bushido. <br/>
 This is interesting, a samurai think that his sword<br/>
is an extention of his body.  So he consider his sword<br/>
a part of it.   Besides, it was his primary weapon,<br/>
his life depends on it ( think about this carefully ).<br/>
  The katana is that, a weapon !!!   And the samurai<br/>
more than any one else new that.   <br/>
Something funny about this is that there is anything<br/>
on the Bushido code that have to do with weapons !!!<br/>
It is a moral and correct conduct code.    Then I<br/>
think that all this is a romantic tale out of some<br/>
Noh.   <br/>
Now, if you tell me that a samurai fells something<br/>
special and spiritual for his sword, I will be with<br/>
you in a 100%.   <br/>
<br/>
Best regards.    <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1593440110">Ha Ha u struck again Ms Boal thats an awesome question and depends on how u look at it. If we treat martial arts or life in general as living to make the lives of others better than how is there a lose in honor for n e thing of a sort of selling to help provide for ones family. However, if u wanna tie Pride and Honor together then thats totally something else.<br/>

<h3>RE: [samuraihistory] Sword Is The Soul Of The Samurai?</h3>
by <i>ninaboal21044</i>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-919364843">Great points made here. I snipped out some of your post in the interest of<br/>
brevity and saving bandwidth.<br/>
<br/>
I believe that the idea of "The Sword Is The Soul Of The Samurai" came about<br/>
during the Edo period. This was during the time of peace and various<br/>
scholars and others of the samurai class were seeking basically for a<br/>
"raison d'etre" (reason for being) for their class. Many of them began<br/>
intensive studies of various forms of bujutsu and the concept of "budo" was<br/>
born during this era. I read somewhere (not sure where I read it) that the<br/>
concept of the sword being a samurai's soul was first expressed by Tokugawa<br/>
Ieyasu after he became the Shogun, but don't hold me exactly to this. <br/>
<br/>
Saying that a sword was a samurai's "soul" was designed to make him more<br/>
"spiritual," that his sword and study and preservation of budo (martial way)<br/>
was an ideal for a samurai to strive for when there was peace and no longer<br/>
any actual wars for a samurai to practice any bujutsu (martial tactics).<br/>
<br/>
Needless to say, this was an idealistic view put forth. In reality, many<br/>
samurai became a lot more interested in commerce and administration than in<br/>
martial arts; the actual "soul" of the administrative samurai was more<br/>
likely to be an abacus rather than a sword. But the daisho (the two swords)<br/>
became a status symbol, a badge showing rank rather than a real "soul" so to<br/>
speak.   <br/>
<br/>
Then there were the struggling ronin and low-ranked, low-paid clan samurai,<br/>
most who were more concerned with surviving and feeding their families<br/>
rather than in whether their sword was their "soul" or not. These were the<br/>
ones who would likely pawn their swords and wear hidden bamboo swords. The<br/>
film SEPPUKU deals with one of these ronin who did so. This film challenges<br/>
the official, prevailing Edo-era definition of "the sword is the soul" as a<br/>
concept that has become empty and hypocritical in the face of rank<br/>
oppression and cruelty. <br/>
<br/>
I believe that there were a few samurai who followed the path of "musha<br/>
shugyo" the martial journey, traveling all over the country in pursuit of<br/>
studying kendo and other budo. But they were most likely in the minority.<br/>
<br/>

 </span></blockquote>This all may very well be true. But this is the "samurai history list," which <br/>
means that it's designed to talk about "the good ol' days." <br/>
<br/>
Some of these notions i.e. "the sword is the soul of the samurai," "bushido," <br/>
etc. have gotten distorted in current times. But I don't care about these <br/>
contemporary distortions of these terms, as I want to study history here. So the <br/>
legitimate questions remain: how did these concepts affect samurai in <br/>
historical times? <br/>
<br/>
Myself, I believe that the concepts came out of the Edo period, when fighting <br/>
was scarce or else non-existent. Still, samurai existed for around 250 years <br/>
during this time and their history is interesting to study.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>This all may very well be true. But this is the "samurai history list,"<br/>
which<br/>
means that it's designed to talk about "the good ol' days."<br/>
<br/>
Some of these notions i.e. "the sword is the soul of the samurai,"<br/>
"bushido,"<br/>
etc. have gotten distorted in current times. But I don't care about these<br/>
contemporary distortions of these terms, as I want to study history here. So<br/>
the<br/>
legitimate questions remain: how did these concepts affect samurai in<br/>
historical times?<br/>
<br/>
Myself, I believe that the concepts came out of the Edo period, when<br/>
fighting<br/>
was scarce or else non-existent. Still, samurai existed for around 250 years<br/>
during this time and their history is interesting to study.<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>To which historical accounts are you referring?  Written when?  In<br/>
Japanese or English?  For a popular or academic audience?  Peer<br/>
reviewed (as in university and other scholarly presses)?<br/>
All of these (and many more) are the first questions one normally<br/>
would ask about sources quoted in support of any statement or<br/>
hypothesis.  Without some idea of the sources that you are using, a<br/>
statement such as 'some historical accounts I've read' has an<br/>
indeterminate authority and leaves me (and I suspect others) curious<br/>
as to the accuracy that we can expect from the sources.<br/>
<br/>
The next thing that I would point out is that these are just movies. <br/>
While I like Kurosawa and Tokugawa-set period pieces, I don't beleive<br/>
anyone would put much faith in their historical accuracy.  That is not<br/>
to say that the things that movies depict are necessarily untrue, but<br/>
simply that they can't be relied upon as historical documents in the<br/>
same way that contemporaneous materials can.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> > <br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Another thing to keep in mind is that the stories that come down to us<br/>
throug history and are popularized in  books that treat the samurai<br/>
and the concept of honor (among other things), often uncritically<br/>
choose those stories/anecdotes/legends that support the picture of the<br/>
samurai that they are trying to paint and do a poor job at addressing<br/>
alternative interpretations of the sources that do exist.  I believe<br/>
that most of us have probably heard that a samurai's topknot was,<br/>
similar to the sword, sacrosanct as a badge of the privileged class to<br/>
which he belonged.  If memory serves, Kurosawa in 7 Samurai, has one<br/>
of the main characters cut hit hair to impersonate a priest in order<br/>
to achieve a solution to the hostage stalemate.  Who to believe, the<br/>
popular history books or Kurosawa...or are both depictions accurate.<br/>
<br/>
I have been reading and trying to get caught up with the threads that<br/>
I have missed during the last year or so, that I have been absent from<br/>
the list and am enjoying the variety of topics that have come up. <br/>
Some of the recent threads in particular have piqued my curiosity, but<br/>
it seems reasonable for us to analyze the assumptions behind some of<br/>
the questions that we are asking and to be as clear as possible about<br/>
the sources that we use so that everyone has an idea as to the<br/>
relative accuracy and authority of the information. <br/>
<br/>
Granted that many times we don't have our references to hand when we<br/>
are inspired to post, but even in those cases it might be nice to<br/>
follow up including the citations in a later post in the thread.<br/>

<h3>Sword Is The Soul Of The Samurai? (was RE: [samuraihistory] Re: h itokiri kawaka</h3>
by <i>onnagozen</i>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1482848985">Not to be argumentative, but "just movies" is probably what got a lot<br/>
of us started in our interest of Japan.  Some movies are plain<br/>
entertainment, nothing wrong with that.  Others have been made by<br/>
someone with their own political or social agenda.  Still more have<br/>
been made by people with access to research material and reflect some<br/>
kind of truth.<br/>
I am also interested to understand why you prefer archive material,<br/>
and how you are assured of its veracity. Since every contemporaneous<br/>
writer would have reflected whatever particular axe he (or his<br/>
superior) wished to grind, how are you sure that they are writing the<br/>
truth and not tweaking, spinning or slanting?  I don't think spin is<br/>
anything new, it's been going on for as long as we have.  Thus, any<br/>
historical piece written by someone who was there (IF you can find it)<br/>
has to be seived through, and a large pinch of salt added.  If it<br/>
happened 300, 500 or 800 years ago, and there are several sources<br/>
available who contradict each other, what makes you choose one side?  <br/>
<br/>
Compared to most people I'm an ignoramous, but I'm not so stupid as to<br/>
believe something that is unprovable.  I prefer to go with my gut<br/>
instincts, and then doubt them too!  Ultimately, that's all any of us<br/>
have, a feeling that the source whose view we prefer is the one that<br/>
is correct.  But we can't KNOW, so relying on it, quoting on it or<br/>
swearing on it is just plain daft.  Why would you doubt that a film<br/>
maker has spent years of research in order to present his film in the<br/>
most accurate possible light?  <br/>
<br/>
All verions of history are fascinating, interesting and worthy of<br/>
exploration, if for no other reason than to see how opposing views<br/>
evolve.  Definitive decisions about what is real and what is not is<br/>
beyond our field of expertise, and the sooner we understand that, the<br/>
sooner we stop criticising others for not toe-ing our particular party<br/>
line.<br/>

Kurosawa doesn't try to do everything<br/>
"accurately"--his depiction of Nagashino in<br/>
"Kagemusha" is nowhere near accurate. It's all for<br/>
dramatic effect, though, which suits his purpose. Is<br/>
that morally wrong? No. However, we should recognize<br/>
fiction for fiction, and not place too much faith in<br/>
its historical accuracy. <br/>

<h3>Sword Is The Soul Of The Samurai? (was RE: [samuraihistory] Re: h itokiri kawaka</h3>

<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1387816180">Quote:Because film is inherently about entertainment, and<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> > therefore ticket sales, not about accuracy<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Some films are, some film makers only care about the next buck.  Not<br/>
all films outside of Hollywood are made that cynically, or are you<br/>
making a sweeping generalisation here?  And what is wrong with<br/>
entertainment if it gives you a stepping stone into learning more? <br/>
And how does something that inspires an interest, like a good film<br/>
does, automatically become suspect?  And how do you know (and I mean<br/>
KNOW, without any doubt) that the historical things you read are<br/>
accurate and truthful and not slanted to suit the political agenda of<br/>
the writer.  How many documentaries have you seen where they get the<br/>
basic, fundamental things wrong and the narrator can't even pronounce<br/>
simple things correctly?  How many books about a specific subject have<br/>
you read, and then found another with an opposing view?  Does any of<br/>
this really matter, unless you want to think of yourself as an<br/>
"expert" or a definitive source of knowledge?  And finally, since we<br/>
are all capable of telling the difference between a film made for pure<br/>
entertainment and one made with loftier ideals, isn't turning your<br/>
nose up at all films a bit pointless?<br/>
<br/>
Whether Kurosawa used poetic licence or not in order to make a more<br/>
entertaining film, who on earth cares?  I wasn't aware that he was a<br/>
documentary maker who had sworn a blood oath to only depict all the<br/>
truths that anyone ever wrote about the latter days of Takeda Shingen.<br/>
 I've seen any number of films about Shingen, all of them give you a<br/>
different viewpoint, most are entertaining too.  What's the bet that<br/>
most books about him have just as many viewpoints but slightly less<br/>
entertainment value.  Why does it matter?  Are you concerned that we<br/>
are gullible enough to believe that a film is equal to the truth?  <br/>
If I couldn't tell the difference I'd need locking up.  My point is<br/>
this, just because films are not a reliable source, doesn't mean that<br/>
every history book IS, and you can't know anyway, because you weren't<br/>
there, and those that were there won't necessarily write everything as<br/>
it happened if it doesn't suit their purpose.  Saying, in effect, film<br/>
=lies and half truths, history book = 100% correct is still daft. <br/>
Assuming that I believe every film I see to be a documentary is insulting.<br/>

I think that is a bad thing--I'm not saying it is. <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
And how do you<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> > know (and I mean<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>That's why you read multiple sources and compare them.<br/>
The difference here is intent--a film maker's goal<br/>
isn't historical accuracy--it's to tell the story he<br/>
wants to tell, and elicit a certain reaction from an<br/>
audience. Again, there is nothing wrong with that--but<br/>
99.9% of the time in conflicts with simply presenting<br/>
facts as is. <br/>
<br/>
  And<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>AGAIN, I'm not turning my nose up at all films. And<br/>
are we all capable of telling the difference? I think<br/>
not. Stick around for a while, and you'll see plenty<br/>
of people who come here, believing that what they see<br/>
in movies is real. You have no idea how many people we<br/>
get here that think that because they saw it on<br/>
Rurouni Kenshin, it must be true. I seriously<br/>
challenge the premise that "we are all capable of<br/>
telling the difference", because it's consistently<br/>
proven here that many people cannot. <br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> > Whether Kurosawa used poetic licence or not in order<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I SPECIFICALLY said that he did that to suit his<br/>
purpose--and that's fine. If you watch Kagemusha in<br/>
order to see an entertaining and moving film, you'll<br/>
be satisfied. If you're looking for an accurate<br/>
depiction of the battle of Nagashino, you will come<br/>
away with mistaken impressions. <br/>
<br/>
 I wasn't<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> > aware that he was a<br/>

> depict all the<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Knock off the condescending attitude. Nowhere did I<br/>
ever imply the above, much less say it. Kurosawa was a<br/>
fabulous filmmaker who made wonderful movies. However,<br/>
he WASN'T a documentary maker--that's my entire point.<br/>
Accuracy in details was something he was very good<br/>
at--costuming, etc. However, accurate reflection of<br/>
historical events wasn't his desire. As I've said for<br/>
the 400th time, there's nothing wrong with that. I was<br/>
simply using him as an example--he created works of<br/>
fiction. If people take them as historical<br/>
representations, which, as stated above, many people<br/>
mistakenly take genre fiction to be, they will be<br/>
accepting as fact things that are not facts at all. <br/>
<br/>
 Are you<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> > concerned that we<br/>
> are gullible enough to believe that a film is equal<br/>
> to the truth?  <br/>
> If I couldn't tell the difference I'd need locking<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Well, there certainly are a lot of people who justify<br/>
that concern. Do you wish to call the police for them<br/>
to be locked up, or should I?<br/>
<br/>
 My point is<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> > this, just because films are not a reliable source,<br/>

> because you weren't<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>True, history books have flaws, and no, we can't know<br/>
if every one is exactly right because we weren't<br/>
there. However, that doesn't mean that fiction is just<br/>
as correct as non-fiction. That's why you read<br/>
multiple sources and evaluate the credibility of each.<br/>
Your argument is philosphical sophistry--errors in<br/>
history books do NOT mean that fictional accounts are<br/>
just as correct. <br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> > Saying, in effect, film<br/>

> is still daft. <br/>
> Assuming that I believe every film I see to be a<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Not as insulting as your willfully ignoring what I<br/>
actually wrote, or your condescending attitude. Not<br/>
very smart to direct that at a list moderator. As I<br/>
said, plenty of people come onto this site believing<br/>
that what they see in movies, fictional books, anime,<br/>
manga, etc. is historical fact. Nowhere did I say that<br/>
history books were 100% correct--the point is, their<br/>
purpose is to try to be correct, whereas fiction's<br/>
purpose isn't to be, it's to entertain. <br/>
