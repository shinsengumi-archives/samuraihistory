<br/>
By Peter Neville-Hadley-Contributing writer<br/>
<br/>
Tokyo-"Miura Anjin?" replied the print-seller as he carefully<br/>
wrapped up a 19th-century woodblock image of a stopping place on the<br/>
Tokaido, the great coastal highway from Tokyo to the west. "The most<br/>
famous Englishman in Japan," he said. "Except perhaps for David<br/>
Beckham."<br/>
<br/>
The soccer star's image has recently been dominating billboards and<br/>
broadcasts across the country with endorsements for cosmetics, cell<br/>
phones and chocolate. Miura Anjin, whose English name was William<br/>
Adams, died nearly four centuries ago, leaving no known image. In<br/>
the West, what small fame Adams retains is largely due to novelist<br/>
James Clavell having loosely based the character of John Blackthorne<br/>
on him in his blockbuster Shogun. But in Japan, Adams is remembered<br/>
as a man who brought a wider understanding of Europeans, adopted<br/>
Japanese ways to a degree few foreigners master even today and found<br/>
himself adopted in return.<br/>
<br/>
Of modest education, he rose to become not only a key advisor to the<br/>
ruler of a nation vastly different from his own, but also the lord<br/>
of his own manor and the first foreign member of the warrior samurai<br/>
class.<br/>
<br/>
Finding traces of him involves travelling to remote rural locations<br/>
which even today rarely see foreign visitors. Hong Kong-based Walk<br/>
Japan has put together an 11-day guided itinerary linking Adams'<br/>
various trading, advising and interpreting activities. The<br/>
organizers, not your run-of-the-mill tour guides but academics<br/>
who've made a thorough study of Adams, have set out a route south<br/>
from Tokyo to small ports on the coast of the main island of Honshu,<br/>
then westward to the smaller island of Kyushu and then to tiny<br/>
Hirado, once the base for the British and Dutch traders. There's<br/>
even a walk on hidden remnants of the ancient Tokaido itself.<br/>
<br/>
Adams, brought up in London's Limehouse dock area, apprenticed as a<br/>
shipwright and pilot. But it was navigation that became his career,<br/>
and after 10 years on ships trading with North Africa he became the<br/>
principal pilot of a disastrous Dutch expedition to the Spice<br/>
Islands of the East Indies.<br/>
<br/>
A series of misfortunes in which the tiny fleet was scattered or<br/>
sunk led to a decision by the remaining two ships, in 1600, to cross<br/>
the largely uncharted and rarely sailed Pacific. Only Adams' ship De<br/>
Liefde survived, along with a handful of its crew. The lord of the<br/>
tiny Kyushu town where they landed sent Adams as spokesman for his<br/>
group to the warlord Tokugawa Ieyasu, then attempting to gain<br/>
control of the whole of Japan.<br/>
<br/>
Ieyasu had a healthy interest in foreign ideas and spent hours<br/>
interrogating Adams through an interpreter, then imprisoned him<br/>
until he decided what to do. Subsequent audiences improved both<br/>
Ieyasu's knowledge of Europe and his respect for the pilot, who was<br/>
eventually released and reunited with the remaining survivors.<br/>
<br/>
Seeing a future use for them, he had the men provided with funds and<br/>
ordered them to sail to his base at Edo, modern-day Tokyo, then<br/>
ignored them while he concentrated on winning total control of<br/>
Japan. The cannon from De Liefde proved of more immediate value,<br/>
helping him clinch his final victory at the battle of Sekigahara.<br/>
<br/>
As months went by the decrepit Dutch ship sank and the crew<br/>
scattered, suspecting that they would never be allowed to return<br/>
home. But Ieyasu had thought of other ways in which their technology<br/>
could help him. With his battles won he awarded each man an ample<br/>
daily ration of rice and set Adams an important task.<br/>
<br/>
Our search for Adams/Miura began at Nihon Bashi, the central Tokyo<br/>
bridge which marked the start of the Tokaido and four other ancient<br/>
highways. It was originally built in 1603, three years after<br/>
Ieyasu's victory, and the year he was officially confirmed as de<br/>
facto ruler or shogun by a powerless and impoverished emperor.<br/>
<br/>
That year the shogun, having recognized Adams' worth as a truthful<br/>
adviser on everything foreign, gave him a townhouse near the new<br/>
bridge, amongst the warehouses and shops of Edo's rapidly developing<br/>
commercial quarter. A short walk from the current crossing, built in<br/>
1911, we found the navigator had earned himself a place on modern<br/>
maps. In a narrow turning named Anjin-dori a small, rough-hewn stele<br/>
marked the site of his residence, mentioning that he instructed the<br/>
shogun in gunnery and mathematics.<br/>
<br/>
The next morning we boarded a southbound commuter train. At the<br/>
wealthy suburb of Taura we took a taxi to a high point overlooking a<br/>
naval base where the modern equivalents of Adams' well-armed De<br/>
Liefde wallowed. Adams had a vast estate here, on the Miura<br/>
Peninsula, given him by Ieyasu as a reward for constructing ocean-<br/>
going ships in the Western style. These were far more seaworthy than<br/>
Japanese junks, and although Adams had no experience building one<br/>
from scratch he produced two vessels. A path led to a thick hedge<br/>
and a stout fence surrounding the graves of Adams, his Japanese wife<br/>
and their two children.<br/>
<br/>
A winding walk down steep residential backstreets led to the station<br/>
at Anjin-zuka (Anjin's Hill). A few minutes' ride and we disembarked<br/>
at Hemi station. Here a track, with natural tree-root stairways,<br/>
wound over hills, along ridge tops and down to the 13th-century<br/>
Great Buddha of Kamakura, a 13-metre-high bronze of a serene, seated<br/>
figure, hands together in its lap. In 1613 Adams came this way in<br/>
the company of John Saris, an emissary from Britain's King James,<br/>
who had arrived bearing a letter requesting trade. Saris and crew<br/>
were the first Englishmen Adams had seen since his arrival, and he<br/>
brought them to the shogun to help successfully negotiate the<br/>
privileges requested.<br/>
<br/>
A picturesque train ride west around the coastline brought us to<br/>
Ito, the site of Adams' shipbuilding efforts. The city has erected a<br/>
statue of the man: gaunt, high-cheekboned and shovel-bearded,<br/>
gesturing out to sea.<br/>
<br/>
We spent the night at a riverside inn of considerable antiquity, a<br/>
labyrinth of creaking boards, steep stairways and tatami-floored<br/>
rooms with sliding screens. We changed for the evening into cotton<br/>
yukata gowns, short haori jackets and slippers.<br/>
<br/>
When the first Europeans arrived, 50 years before Adams, the<br/>
fastidious Japanese were struck by their gaudy doublets but<br/>
marvelled that this finery contained men so uninterested in washing.<br/>
Adams eventually submerged himself in Japanese culture and adopted<br/>
local dress. Now we did the same. We flapped our way to a basement<br/>
bathing area, scrubbing ourselves spotless before slipping into the<br/>
geothermally heated waters for a soak, then headed for a feast of<br/>
colourful dishes, mixed with liberal quantities of beer and local<br/>
sake.<br/>
<br/>
Continuing ever west, at Hatsudenshomae, a few hops by train and bus<br/>
later, we climbed one of the few remaining sections of the great<br/>
Tokaido, the main highway to the west. It snaked up the hillside,<br/>
some of its original uneven paving still in place-perhaps the very<br/>
stones Adams himself walked on numerous trips between the foreign<br/>
trading houses at Hirado and the capital at Edo.<br/>
<br/>
At Kyoto we visited magnificent Nijo Castle, begun by Ieyasu in<br/>
1602, its purpose to make his dominance over the emperor clear. Here<br/>
he was formally installed as shogun with several days of feasting.<br/>
The luxury meant to impress Japan's nobles still remains in the vast<br/>
halls with their gilded walls and screens painted with scenes of<br/>
pines, birds and tigers.<br/>
<br/>
We travelled on to Miya-jima, a train and boat ride from Hiroshima,<br/>
to see the towering, orange-painted torii, or gate, which seems to<br/>
stride into the sea off the tiny island's coast. The torii, built in<br/>
1168, was ancient even when Adams passed by here on his way to<br/>
Kyushu. He would have gone by ship; we took the bullet train through<br/>
a tunnel beneath the placid waters of Japan's Inland Sea.<br/>
<br/>
Just off Kyushu's west coast is Dejima, a fan-shaped artificial<br/>
island constructed to house foreign traders. In 1639, Ieyasu's son<br/>
Hidetada, irritated by Catholic preaching that allegiance to the<br/>
Pope took precedence over feudal allegiances, banned all foreigners.<br/>
The British had already left, but the Dutch, protected because Adams<br/>
had made clear the distinction between Catholic and Protestant<br/>
teaching, were merely moved to this tiny enclave connected to Kyushu<br/>
by a single, well-guarded bridge. Some of the Dutch colony's<br/>
buildings have been recreated and fitted out as excellent museums<br/>
explaining foreigners' impact on Japan. Adams is remembered in a<br/>
picture of the departure of De Liefde from Holland in 1598.<br/>
<br/>
Our final stop was Hirado, the small island off Kyushu where Dutch<br/>
and British trading houses were first set up. Adams came to this<br/>
remote spot many times. On the hillside above the sleepy little town<br/>
and its quiet harbour we found a small, neat garden of bamboo, pines<br/>
and cycads, with a monument to 17 British merchant-adventurers. The<br/>
stone next to it was something of a surprise: "Miura Anjin's tomb."<br/>
We'd already seen his grave several hundred kilometres away, so it<br/>
seemed that even in death Adams was a traveller.<br/>
<br/>
He died on Hirado on May 26, 1620, and given Japan's summer<br/>
temperatures it seems likely that the island still has him, although<br/>
it's impossible to say for certain: after the banning of foreigners<br/>
in 1639, the remains of English mariners were disinterred and flung<br/>
into the sea. Those of Adams may not have been among them, however:<br/>
suspiciously long bones were discovered nearby in the 1920s. Perhaps<br/>
he was left undisturbed.<br/>
<br/>
In a land with few foreign heroes, Beckham's billboards will have<br/>
their day. But what greater sign of enduring respect than to have<br/>
your name carved in not one, but two tombstones?<br/>
