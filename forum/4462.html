<br/>
if its the one Ihave on tape its a joke.<br/>
<br/>
never met hayes but met most of the senior Bujinkan<br/>
ranks in the USA. <br/>
<br/>
Hayes is a tendai priest and has been attacked quite<br/>
openly on some mikkyo mailllists for his comments.<br/>
<br/>
He is also the one responsible for telling the wold<br/>
ninja had straight swords, anmd also trying to<br/>
introduce the kuji crap into the Ninjutsu as its<br/>
taught today. Kuji may have been a part of ninjutsu<br/>
but his books are ull of stuff form Tibet etc which is<br/>
not Japanese Ninjutsu.<br/>
<br/>
He made his millions out of it so I doubt he cares<br/>
