<h3>Request for Information on Japanese Castle sieges----Prof Murphy</h3>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-836624663">Hello,  I am a Fellow of the Japan Foundation and am  currently researching <br/>
the sieges of Nagashino Castle in 1575 and that of Osaka Castle in 1615.  While <br/>
I have found much information on Japanese castles themselves in "The Age of <br/>
the Country at War,"  there seems to be little information on siege engines <br/>
like catapults.  Also,  I have difficulty in finding information on Japanese <br/>
cannon,  although I know Ishida Mitsunari is known to have deployed 5 cannon at <br/>
Sekigahara (1600).  If anybody can help me  (I prefer contact and sources in <br/>
English),  I would really appreciate it.  If I can help others I shall try,  <br/>
because I feel that before we fall like cherry blossoms,  we should leave a trail <br/>
behind for those who follow.  Cheers!  Professor John F. Murphy Jr.,  The <br/>

branch. I ask because I live in Osaka myself.</div>

<br/>
An interesting period on which to do some research and in the perfect position to do it!<br/>
<br/>
In english: I can recommend the two part Osprey Series "Seige Weapons of the Far East" by Stephen Turnbull and well illustrated by Wayne Reynolds; ISBN 1-84176-339-X & 1-81476-340-3 published 2001/2002. Amazon will provide information.<br/>
<br/>
In japanese:  There are several of the "Red" series Nihon Gunzo Rekishi booklets and at least two of the deluxe "Selection" series by Gakken Publishers that have details of castles and seiges. These are relatively easily available in Japan and in specialist booksellers in Europe and USA.<br/>
<br/>
 It may also be worth checking out a further publication by Stephen Turnbull "Nagashino 1575" published by Osprey in 2000: ISBN 1-84176-250-4<br/>
<br/>
Best wishes with the project<br/>
<br/>
