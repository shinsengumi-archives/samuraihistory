<h3>*sigh* another american Sammyrai</h3>
by <i>kitsuno</i>

Jerry Greene <br/>
KISSIMMEE -- What can you do?<br/>
<br/>
You got some unique skill? I used to know some folks who got <br/>
together every year and clucked the William Tell Overture. You know, <br/>
just like chickens. But I lost track of them, hard as that might <br/>
seem.<br/>
<br/>
The clucking always seemed a little silly, but this is not. Sensei <br/>
Bradley Knight just returned from Japan, where he set a record by <br/>
slicing 21 apples in midair with his sword in 60 seconds. That's <br/>
toss an apple, draw his sword, slice the apple, sheath his sword and <br/>
toss again. The Guinness World Records people are processing it now.<br/>
<br/>
"In a way, it is a stunt," Knight said, "but it displays the <br/>
training needed to target an object accurately and quickly."<br/>
<br/>
Trust me, there's no need to travel to distant corners of the globe <br/>
to find exotic events and alternative lifestyles. Look around us. <br/>
The unusual is everywhere.<br/>
<br/>
Try 980 E. Carroll Street, the location of the Tiger's Den school of <br/>
karate training led by sensei Knight. The day we visited, he was <br/>
working with children of various ages. They don't work with swords, <br/>
but it was a special treat for them to watch Knight demonstrate his <br/>
skill for our photographer.<br/>
<br/>
Besides, who doesn't like a slice of apple?<br/>
<br/>
Knight, a youthful-looking 35, took eight of his adult students with <br/>
him to Japan, where the apple slicing was a part of an enriching <br/>
trip.<br/>
<br/>
"The whole thing was amazing," said Phil Powell, a student who was <br/>
the first to slice and dice, cutting 14. "I was in heaven for a <br/>
couple of minutes."<br/>
<br/>
The demonstration was covered by seven Japanese camera crews and <br/>
three newspapers. Another TV crew followed Knight and his students <br/>
for the rest of their trip to document "the American samurai."<br/>
<br/>
The students went for the overall experience, but Knight went for <br/>
additional training from his 76-year-old teacher, who sliced 18 <br/>
apples in 60 seconds to prove he's hardly lost it.<br/>
<br/>
"It's a shame in our culture that there isn't more respect shown for <br/>
our elders," Knight said. "So often, it's just 'Get out of here, old <br/>
man,' when we can learn so much."<br/>
<br/>
I like this man.<br/>
<br/>
Another topic had to be broached -- the movies. What does someone <br/>
think about the popular martial arts films if he really knows what <br/>
can and cannot be done?<br/>
<br/>
"My wife gets upset when I start to complain during the movie," <br/>
Knight admitted. "It's not magic. Like Crouching Tiger, Hidden <br/>
Dragon, all the flying through the air. They'd have to be <br/>
superhuman."<br/>
<br/>
He did like the Kill Bill flicks, pointing out that most of the <br/>
stunts were possible. "The only thing is that if the girl in the <br/>
lead did all those things, she would be really tired."<br/>
<br/>
Knight, meanwhile, seems at peace with his life. His parents live in <br/>
Kissimmee, and he finds nothing strange about teaching his skills on <br/>
a quiet street in Central Florida to classes that include about one <br/>
woman for every two men.<br/>
<br/>
"We try to learn how to avoid altercation but be prepared if it <br/>
happens," Knight said.<br/>
<br/>
As for the impending Guinness record for apple slicing?<br/>
<br/>
"Before I had the record, it seemed like a big thing. Now, not so <br/>
much. It's a steppingstone," he said.<br/>
<br/>
Footnote: When you enter the Tiger's Den, you must remove your <br/>
shoes. I do the same thing at home, mainly because I hate to wear <br/>
shoes. But it's nice to know that the American samurai and I are <br/>
actually so much alike.</div>

                                I once watched a television documentary on the same subject .Two Japanese officers in  Nanking entwined in a competition to see who could chop of the most heads in a single day.A young corperal had the job of picking up the heads and putting them in to baskets in an attempt to keep count.The officers lost count around 112 with the boy unable to keep up.<br/>
After a few days of trying the officers sword arms grew tired and they resorted to shooting their victims with a pistol ,it being much quicker.They killed men , women ,soldiers and civilians.They interviewed one of the surviving officers and he said' there is no devil, we were the devil.Both men and others like them were hardely samurai.<br/>

<br/>
At the battle of Nanking in 1937, correspondent Asami from the Tokyo <br/>
Nichinichi Shimbun (now known as the Mainichi Shimbun) reported how <br/>
two lieutenants of the Japanese army had held a gkilling contesth <br/>
on the way to Nanking,<br/>
in the form of a race to see which could cut down 100 Chinese <br/>
soldiers with Japanese military swords first. This fictitious article <br/>
was designed to lift the moral of the Japanese army; however, the <br/>
Japanese newspaper published this story as though it were totally <br/>
accurate and true.<br/>
<br/>
On the 18th December 1947, the Nanking War Crimes Tribunal of China <br/>
sentenced lieutenants Mukai and Noda to execution on the grounds of <br/>
this false story. The two were shot to death by a firing squad at <br/>
Yuhuatai, Nankingon the 28th January 1948. <br/>
@The family of the bereaved; namely the younger sister of lieutenant <br/>
Noda, Mrs. Masa Noda, the eldest daughter of lieutenant Mukai, Mrs. <br/>
Emiko Cooper, and the second daughter Mrs. Chieko Tadokoro, in fear <br/>
of the general media and press, have since led sad and bitter lives <br/>
for 50 or so years, labeled as the family of war criminals. However, <br/>
their patience eventually wore out and on the 28th April 2003, they <br/>
finally went to the Tokyo District Court having decided to take their <br/>
first and last piece of legal action, demanding the suspension of <br/>
publication of certain texts, for official apologies to be published <br/>
in newspapers and to claim compensation for damages.<br/>
<br/>
@The accused are:<br/>
@(i)@@@Mainichi Shmnbun, who repeatedly reported untrue story and <br/>
who to this day have yet correct these fallacies or admitted they <br/>
were false,<br/>
@(ii)@ @Katsuichi Honda, the author of the books gA trip around <br/>
Chinah, hThe Road to Nankingh andh Thirteen Lies by the Deniers <br/>
of the Nanking Massacreh, who continues to write how the killing, <br/>
which has been shown to be false, is true;<br/>
@(iii)@@Asahi Shimbun and Kashiwashobo Publishing Company, who <br/>
continue to publish the above mentioned in (ii) and other related <br/>
texts.<br/>
<br/>
@The Accuser, Mrs. Chieko Tadokoro and Mr. Yutaka Gohda <br/>
(Representative of the Asian Friendship Association), friend of chief <br/>
barrister Mrs. Tomomi Inada, initiated the appeal, and with the <br/>
support Of gThe Society of Answering the Spirits of the War <br/>
Heroesh, gJapan Conferenceh, gJapan Policy Research Centreh, and <br/>
gThe Society of Supporting Lieutenants Mukai and Noda of the Battle <br/>
of Nankingh, The Society to support the 100- Chinese- soldiers- <br/>
killing-contest case was founded on the 28th June 2003. The Society <br/>
is made up approximately 500 members.<br/>
<br/>
Unless we win this court case, history textbooks will continue to <br/>
state incorrect facts, the press will go unpunished, Japanfs erratic <br/>
policy towards China will stay in the dark and the false items on <br/>
display in the Memorial Hall of the War Resistance against Japan in <br/>
China will remain on view forever.<br/>
@In his article which appeared in the Seiron column of the Sankei <br/>
Shimbun published on the 15th July, 2003 Mr. Keiichiro Kobori, <br/>
Adviser for the Society, writes Quote The story which appeared in the <br/>
Tokyo Nichinichi Shimbun regarding g100 solders killing contesth <br/>
was totally fictional and a total creation. The lack of apology and <br/>
admission of fallacy from Mr. Asami, writer of the false article, <br/>
since the war, is a serious issue. Many books, including gThe <br/>
Fallacy of the Nanking Massacreh written by Akira Suzuki, present <br/>
the arguments of many historians and researchers explaining how the <br/>
killing could never have taken place. gKatsuichi Hondah, writer for <br/>
Asahi Shimbun, intentionally backed up the lies presented in gA trip <br/>
around Chinah and does not admit to this.<br/>
However, the fact that the Japanese army did not reject the article <br/>
in the Tokyo Nichinichi Shimbun remains true. Thus it is the duty of <br/>
the former troop members to help rectify and make disappear the shame <br/>
of the whole Japanese army by supporting this case. Unquote<br/>
@Please also refer to the articles published in the Sankei Shinbun <br/>
dated 18th May, 6th July and 8th July as well as Mrs. Chieko <br/>
Tadokorofs statement regarding the first trial which was held on the <br/>
7th July for further informations.<br/>
