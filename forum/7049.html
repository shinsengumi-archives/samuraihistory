A new exhibition at the Royal Armouries museum in Leeds explores the <br/>
extraordinary career of Tokugawa Ieyasu, the man who unified Japan <br/>
and inspired a bestselling novel. By Louise Jury<br/>
06 May 2005<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
He was called Lord Toranaga in James Clavell's book for the sake of <br/>
artistic licence; it permitted a love interest for which there was <br/>
no documentary proof. But the real Shogun who inspired the <br/>
bestseller and subsequent television drama was Lord Tokugawa Ieyasu, <br/>
one of the most outstanding figures in Japanese history and a lord <br/>
still revered in his homeland 400 years after his death.<br/>
<br/>
Now 30 years after Clavell's book was acclaimed for "[taking] the <br/>
Western world into a completely different world", an exhibition at <br/>
the Royal Armouries museum in Leeds is to tell the real-life story <br/>
of the 17th-century leader.<br/>
<br/>
Using more than 50 precious objects, most lent for the first time by <br/>
the Nikko Toshogu shrine where the lord was buried after his death <br/>
in 1616, the exhibition will explore his power and intelligence and <br/>
show how he established a dynasty that ruled a newly stabilised and <br/>
peaceful Japan for 250 years.<br/>
<br/>
So sacred are some of the objects considered that two Shinto priests <br/>
will safeguard their journey to Britain for the show, which will run <br/>
from 6 June to 30 August. Shogun armour sent by Lord Tokugawa for <br/>
King James I and still in the Royal Armouries collection will be a <br/>
highlight. The diary of the British captain, John Saris, who brought <br/>
the gifts to the king, will be lent by the British Library. But four-<br/>
fifths of the exhibits will come from Japan, including decorative <br/>
and functional items illustrating his martial prowess and his <br/>
interests in astronomy and the art.<br/>
<br/>
Yet when Lord Tokugawa was born in 1543, his domination could not <br/>
have been predicted. He was the son of a minor territorial lord at a <br/>
time when Japan had been riven with civil war for a couple of <br/>
centuries. In the following decades, the feuding territorial lords <br/>
were gradually overcome and united, under the warriors Oda Nobunaga <br/>
and then Toyotomi Hideyoshi. Tokugawa Ieyasu, who fought his first <br/>
battle aged 16 and would fight his last more than half a century <br/>
later, had a tough training under both men. At one stage, he was <br/>
forced to kill his wife while his first son committed suicide to <br/>
satisfy lords who suspected him of disloyalty.<br/>
<br/>
Upon Hideyoshi's death, Tokugawa swore allegiance to the warrior's <br/>
family, but did prove disloyal when, in 1600, he fought and defeated <br/>
Hideyoshi's supporters at the battle of Seki-ga-Hari, a bloody <br/>
battle which saw 36,000 left dead or seriously injured in a single <br/>
day.<br/>
<br/>
After that, he was granted the title of Shogun, or military leader <br/>
of Japan, which meant that he was running the country. While the <br/>
ostensible rulers were Japan's emperors, from the 13th century they <br/>
effectively abrogated power to the military. "The emperors were <br/>
there in the imperial palace in Kyoto, powerless paupers, carrying <br/>
out a few ceremonial duties," said Ian Bottomley, the senior curator <br/>
of oriental arms and armour at the Royal Armouries.<br/>
<br/>
What was extraordinary about Lord Tokugawa was that he did not <br/>
simply consolidate his position in Japan. He began to look outwards <br/>
to countries, such as Portugal and Holland, whose traders and <br/>
missionaries had begun to make contact during the 16th century.<br/>
<br/>
"What is quite staggering, really, is that he tried to establish <br/>
diplomatic relations with the crowned heads of Europe," Mr Bottomley <br/>
said. "Here was this country on the far side of the world which the <br/>
people of Europe had hardly heard about. It was almost mythical. But <br/>
Ieyasu sent diplomatic gifts to the kings of England, France and <br/>
Spain and to the Pope. He also dealt with nearer countries like <br/>
Thailand. He was putting Japan on the diplomatic map."<br/>
<br/>
One of his main ways of doing so was through Will Adams, the <br/>
Englishman who inspired Clavell's character, John Blackthorne, <br/>
played by the actor Richard Chamberlain on television.<br/>
<br/>
Adams, who was born in Kent in 1564, learned shipbuilding, astronomy <br/>
and navigation as a shipyard apprentice before becoming a sailor. In <br/>
1598, he set sail with a Dutch fleet which became stranded in Japan <br/>
after a typhoon and the crew imprisoned in a castle in Osaka on the <br/>
Shogun's orders. But the Shogun took a liking to Adams and <br/>
eventually made him a diplomatic and trade adviser, bestowing great <br/>
privileges upon him as some recompense for refusing him permission <br/>
to leave his court.<br/>
<br/>
Mr Bottomley said Lord Tokugawa was a clever man who appreciated <br/>
what he could learn from the young Englishman and saw the advantages <br/>
that could be obtained by contact with the West. "A lot of people in <br/>
Japan were very inward-looking," Mr Bottomley said. "But Ieyasu was <br/>
a very learned man. He studied navigation and astronomy with Will <br/>
Adams and was interested in the world. Adams was considered too <br/>
valuable to be able to leave."<br/>
<br/>
Tokugawa Ieyasu was Shogun for a couple of years before ceding power <br/>
to one of his five sons. But effectively his rule continued until <br/>
his death, bolstered by having his children in positions of <br/>
authority across Japan and by tactics such as holding the wives and <br/>
families of the territorial lords hostage at the Shogun palace at <br/>
Edo (later Tokyo). He is remembered for his successful unification <br/>
of Japan and for bequeathing it a long-absent stability through the <br/>
establishment of the Tokugawa dynasty.<br/>
<br/>
Mavis Pilbeam, the author of a children's book on Japan under the <br/>
Shoguns and a British Museum librarian, said the relative peace <br/>
enabled Japan's cultural life to flourish - painting, calligraphy, <br/>
theatre and music were already a well-established part of upper-<br/>
class life. "It was an extremely sophisticated court at Edo. The <br/>
Shogun had their own artists. They had Noh-style theatre and music. <br/>
They were very cultured in that way," she said. And all the textiles <br/>
and cloths were fantastic. Silk was made in Japan at that time and <br/>
there were high-class ceramics. They had mastered the art of <br/>
porcelain, which they took from the Chinese and the Koreans. What <br/>
happened under the Tokugawa Shogunate was that because of the <br/>
comparative peace, it was a wonderful period for the arts, [such as] <br/>
the Ukiyo-e school of floating world pictures."<br/>
<br/>
Merchants, though at the bottom of the four-tier social order topped <br/>
by the samurai, had money to spare on such delights because the <br/>
warring had stopped. There was a proliferation of woodcut prints and <br/>
more lavish textiles and ceramics. The British Museum is staging its <br/>
own exhibition at the end of June of prints of heroes of the kabuki <br/>
theatre in Osaka between 1789 and 1830.<br/>
<br/>
Arms and armour became more ornamental as they were no longer <br/>
required for real fighting, but became largely ceremonial.<br/>
<br/>
The teachings of the Chinese philosopher Confucius, who advocated <br/>
keeping people in their place amongst other things, gained <br/>
prominence.<br/>
<br/>
Yet, after Lord Tokugawa Ieyasu's death, many of these developments <br/>
took place behind closed doors. From 1639 until the middle of the <br/>
19th century, Japan ceased dealing with all foreigners, bar the <br/>
Dutch who were allowed trading rights at Nagasaki. The Shogun feared <br/>
Westerners wanted to take the country over. Only in the middle of <br/>
the 19th century did the Americans infiltrate Japanese isolation and <br/>
the country re-opened to the West.<br/>
<br/>
This prompted a renewed fascination with Japan as seen in the <br/>
Gilbert and Sullivan operetta The Mikado and later in Puccini's <br/>
opera Madame Butterfly as well as Japanese influence on garden <br/>
design, the arts and crafts movement and even art nouveau, Ian <br/>
Bottomley said. Japan was added to the Grand Tour after Europe, <br/>
India and America. After a lull during the war, it was revived in <br/>
the Sixties, ripe for Clavell's book in 1975, whichsold seven <br/>
million copies. "What Clavell was writing was fiction. He changed <br/>
names so he could play with history, but he didn't modify it much. <br/>
He just didn't use the names Ieyasu or Will Adams," he said.<br/>
<br/>
For the Royal Armouries, interest in Lord Tokugawa Ieyasu stemmed <br/>
from his gift of the armour, which is now one of the most highly <br/>
prized items in its collection. Peter Armstrong, the Armouries' <br/>
director, said it had begun to forge a relationship with the Nikko <br/>
shrine several years ago with a view to further understanding of the <br/>
armour and other objects in its collections.<br/>
<br/>
The shrine, now a World Heritage site, is one of the most visited in <br/>
Japan though it was not Lord Tokugawa's original resting place. He <br/>
was moved there by imperial decree a year after his death. This <br/>
shrine, too, was deemed too modest and was extended using 4.5 <br/>
million craftsmen and labourers working for 17 months at a cost of <br/>
£200m in today's money. The receipts and wages bill are still kept <br/>
within the shrine complex.<br/>
<br/>
"It has taken about six or seven years to get them to release <br/>
objects that are sacred," Mr Armstrong said. "It's like lending <br/>
bibles from cathedrals."<br/>
<br/>
Whether British visitors will grasp the sacred significance remains <br/>
to be seen despite the Royal Armouries' best efforts to be <br/>
sensitive. At the very least, this exhibition will show fans of Star <br/>
Wars the cultural roots of the look of Darth Vader, an influence no <br/>
one could have predicted in Edo 400 years ago.<br/>
