<h3>the movie: ghost dog and other movies</h3>
by <i>captainnemo12901</i>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1723776217">i just bought the movie Ghost Dog and have not watched it yet, but <br/>
from the comentaries about the movie, I think the purchase may be <br/>
worthwhile.I have also bought a group of black and white movies from <br/>
Japan, some of them dubbed and some subtitled, and they are very <br/>
interesting. One of them is called"Legend of the Eight Samurai" is <br/>
anyone familair with it? It's a "sword and socerey" type movie. Are <br/>
there any recomendations for other Japanse movies of this type?<br/>
         Yours truelly<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1070714688">It's worth to remember that ghost dog is not an assasin just because he wanted, his master (as he calls him) is a mobster who employs him for assasinations, and he obey without asking, as a samurai was expected to, what is worth to bear in mind is that ghost dog always follows the way of the samurai, to the very end, he knew the consequence of killing the entire family of gangsters, and he accepted it, as a samurai was expected to.<br/>

<h3>Need information about Old Samurai</h3>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1541415115">Dear all,<br/>
<br/>
I have collection a samurai with 9 star, Fiji mountain<br/>
and sakura flower, also sun symbol and war flag year<br/>
made with serial number.<br/>
Year made is 1817 and a certificate, It has a suicide<br/>
knife on hand with some powder (I don't know it used<br/>
for), it<br/>
also can use for belt. My question is how can I know<br/>
that is Japanese samurai? is it original?<br/>
<br/>
Thank You.<br/>

	As a member of this list you are free to post digital photographs in <br/>
the members photo area. From your description it is very hard to say <br/>
anything at all about your sword, however if you can share some <br/>
pictures with us there are people on the list who are happy to share <br/>
their knowledge. You'll need several photos; one of the whole sword in <br/>
it's scabbard, one of the naked tang/signature, one of the backside of <br/>
the tang, and if possible one of the first five or six inches above the <br/>
hamachi and one of the kissaki (preferably a close up showing the <br/>
hamon). Kantei from photos is always pretty dicey but as I said we are <br/>
happy to share what we can.<br/>

PS the powder is likely uchiko which is used to clean the blade...</div>
