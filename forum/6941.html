<div id="ygrps-yiv-1757279949"><blockquote><span title="ireply">> Hi Daniele,<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Takasugi Shinsaku - one of the most complex and  interesting of the <br/>
Choshu shishi. There is some information on him in English in the Meiji <br/>
Restoration histories - Choshu in the Meiji Restoration by Albert Craig <br/>
and Jansen's biography of Sakamoto Ryoma. There's quite a lot on <br/>
Google, especially if you read Japanese. (Just need to distinguish <br/>
between the historical figure and the character who appears in <br/>
Kenshin!)<br/>
<br/>
I've got a couple of Japanese biographies on him - one is published by <br/>
the Takasugi museum in Yamaguchi-ken, the Tougyouan. If you <br/>
google this name you'll come up with some more stuff, but you need to <br/>
be able to read Japanese. What exactly did you want to know? I'll help <br/>
with specific questions if I can.<br/>
<br/>
Cheers,<br/>
<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1115988048">First of all I would like to thank everyone of you for your help.<br/>
<br/>
I wrote down your advices and my research it's becoming bigger and bigger..so it's good!I am writing my thesis (sotsuron to be clear) about that incredible man who was Takasugi!As Gillian said if I do a research in internet it is easier to find something about Rurouni Kenshin's Takasugi so I'd rather look for him on books or other pubblications!Sincererly I came to know Takasugi from Kenshin!:D<br/>
<br/>
Well..fortunately there is the" ISTITUTO GIAPPONESE DI CULTURA" in Roma that has a big library so I can find, probably,the books I need.<br/>
<br/>
Now I'm going to search also in web site...<br/>
<br/>
I hope I could find something specific about Takasugi because almost always he is mentioned in books concerned others historical samurai, like Ryoma Sakamoto...<br/>
<br/>
well..<br/>
<br/>
thank you very very much for your help!<br/>
<br/>
I really appreciate!<br/>

THANKS!<br/>

<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1485569983">Hello everyone..<br/>
I am still writing my thesis about Takasugi Shinsaku but I would like to know if someone could resolve a doubt.<br/>
In the beginning I decided only to write my thesis about a person important in the bakumatsu jidai. I had two choices: Takasugi Shinsaku or Kogoro Katsura.<br/>
At first I'd rather prefear write about Kogoro Katsura but when I began the research I couldn't find almost anything about him. So I am trying to understand why this man is so less important than, for exemple Takasugi or Ryoma.<br/>
If someone is able to give me an answer would be nice!<br/>
Thank you!<br/>

	I believe you'll find much more material on Katsura, in <br/>
English anyway, than on Takasugi, again from English sources, if you <br/>
search for Ito Hirobumi the name he chose to use after the <br/>
Restoration. Takasugi is a very romantic figure from the Bakumatsu, <br/>
and like many others from the time he died early which adds a lot to <br/>
his enduring popularity in Japan.<br/>
	Ito on the other hand survived the violence of the <br/>
restoration, tsumannai, and had a long career as a politician in the <br/>
newly formed Meiji government. As one of those Meiji Oligarchs he was <br/>
part of the "new Bakufu" that Saigo wound up fighting against and so <br/>
is not seen as a romantic figure like Takasugi and all the young <br/>
dudes whose early death meant their "pure spirits" were not tainted <br/>
by the money and corruption within the new order.<br/>
	In the west scholars place much more importance on the new <br/>
government and the choices made by it's leaders than on the popular <br/>
revolutionaries who died in it's creation. Look for info on Ito under <br/>
"Meiji" and not "Bakumatsu" and I think you'll find enough <br/>
information for your paper...<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1365341361"><blockquote><span title="ireply">>Katsura Kogoro (1833-77) took the name of Kido Koin (Takayoshi) . <br/>
 </span></blockquote>He is not the same person as Ito Hirobumi (1841-1909) Katsura was <br/>
older than Ito and Takasugi Shinsaku (1839-67) and held a more <br/>
responsible position in the han - however he often came to the <br/>
support of the younger samurai. <br/>
<br/>
Ito is also a interesting character, as Tom writes: from a low-rank <br/>
family he rose to power through his friendship with Takasugi and Inoue <br/>
Bunta (Kaoru), went to England secretly with Inoue, became a shotai <br/>
commander and ended up Japan's first prime minister. But if you want <br/>
more information on Katsura it is Kido Koin/Takayoshi that you must <br/>
search under.> 	<br/>
