<h3>A ninja tale?</h3>
by <i>thomas5403</i>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-577758455">I have just reread "Sahashi Jingoro" by Mori Ogai, and a <br/>
surprising thought sprang to mind.<br/>
<br/>
Without giving the story away, Jingoro, a samurai in the <br/>
service of the Tokugawa, flees after an incident in which <br/>
another samurai is killed. His brother requests an interview <br/>
with Ieyasu and explains the details, asking forgiveness and <br/>
that Jingoro might return.<br/>
<br/>
Ieyasu observes that whilst it is understandable, it cannot be <br/>
allowed to pass. However, if Jingoro would perform a service <br/>
for Ieyasu, then he might consider it. The service is the <br/>
assassination of a Amari Shirasaburo, a Takeda vassal holding <br/>
Koyama castle in Totomi Province and a thorn in Ieyasu's side. <br/>
Ieyasu wanted possession of Koyama.<br/>
<br/>
A tall order, but examining the clues I have shortlisted this:<br/>
<br/>
Jingoro, we are told, was famous for his martial skills;<br/>
He was an accomplished flautist;<br/>
He was an excellent shot with the arquebus;<br/>
His opponent in an argument drew his sword, but Jingoro struck <br/>
and killed him with a single blow that left no visible mark <br/>
upon the body.<br/>
<br/>
All in all - quite a talent.<br/>
<br/>
Jingoro enters the service of Amari, woos him with his flute <br/>
playing, and when they are alone together, kills him.<br/>
<br/>
Ninja? Or simply a samurai with useful shinobi skills?<br/>
<br/>
Whatever, the garrison of Koyama did not surrender so the death of<br/>
Amari achieved nothing of significance.<br/>
<br/>
Interestingly, Jingoro returned to Hamamatsu, but did not stay <br/>
long. When it was suggested he accompany an envoy to Kyoto, <br/>
Ieyasu declined. "I don't want him out of my sight. I have <br/>
heard that Amari loved him like a son," Ieyasu said, "yet the <br/>
cruel fellow killed him in his sleep."<br/>
<br/>
This is a clue to the role and relationship of the samurai to <br/>
the ninja. I do believe that most samurai, if they possessed <br/>
the aptitude, developed shinobi-nin training and were entirely <br/>
capable of the exploits usually accredited to the ninja.<br/>
<br/>
When Ieyasu odered his son to commit seppuku, Hattori Hanzo, <br/>
his celebrated ninja master, was sent to make sure the act was <br/>
carried out. At the last, even Hanzo could not bring himself to <br/>
act as kaishaku (second) knowing the man was innocent. Another <br/>
samurai took his place and struck off Nobuyasu's head.<br/>
<br/>
Later, Ieyasu was heard to say, "even that devil Hanzo could <br/>
not bring himself to kill my son," at which point this samurai <br/>
decided life would be safer elsewhere.<br/>
<br/>
The problem being, once they have proved themselves skilled in <br/>
the arts of deception, they themselves are never quite trusted <br/>
again, even by their masters.<br/>
<br/>
Basically, I reckon most daimyo could find willing volunteers <br/>
from among their own ranks for suicide missions, without having <br/>
to resort to employing untrustworthy outsiders.<br/>
<br/>
Ieyasu and others did employ ninja, but I reckon it was for the <br/>
more mundane and time-consuming operations of surveillance and <br/>
information gathering, the day-to-day donkeywork of military <br/>
intelligence, rather than the fantastic feats of fiction we <br/>
read about.<br/>

<br/>
That sounds like a very interesting story.  And your insights on the <br/>
samurai/ninja relationships are debatable but very good.  I enjoyed <br/>
you input and will lokk for the book.  Unfortunately, sometimes when <br/>
you post a message other people seem to forget that there are many of <br/>
us who may be interested in you opinion.  Even if it doesn't serve <br/>
the specific purpose of an individual.<br/>

<h3>Re: A ninja tale?</h3>
by <i>thomas5403</i>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1983962517">Hi Brandon,<br/>
<br/>
Currently I'm looking at what 'contribution' the ninja played to the<br/>
events of the Sengoku era - if any. (Difficult without records.)<br/>
<br/>
Without getting into a discussion on the mythical status of the<br/>
ninja, I am trying to determine (purely for myself) how the daimyo <br/>
utilised ninja, and how effective they were.<br/>
<br/>
In my opinion, I reckon their best contribution was in gathering<br/>
intelligence on the enemy, mostly by watching, which would involve <br/>
long periods spent in enemy domains. Spying, in fact.<br/>
<br/>
The more theatrical activities - assassination being the most obvious<br/>
- I think had little or no influence on the general outcome - and was <br/>
probably not employed as much as everyone likes to think. <br/>
They might have had a more tactical short-term effect, but cannot be <br/>
guaranteed. (Koyama Castle, in my former post, remained in Takeda <br/>
hands even after the murder of its commander - but perhaps Amari's <br/>
death stopped his incursions into Mikawa.<br/>
<br/>
I'm sure most daimyo could find samurai in their own ranks willing to<br/>
undertake hazardous missions without resorting to employing<br/>
outsiders.<br/>
<br/>
In another tale, a samurai noted for his shinobi skills slipped out<br/>
of his beseiged castle, stole the besieger's standard, and put it<br/>
over the main gate for all too see, as a taunt and insult to the <br/>
besieger and a blow to their morale while boosting their own.<br/>
