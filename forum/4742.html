<h3>Magoichi Saiga</h3>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-927146979">Hello,<br/>
<br/>
Actually I asked the same about one week ago, and some member <br/>
answered quite<br/>
quickly and nicely.<br/>
<br/>
I copy/paste :<br/>
<br/>
"Saiga, or Saigo, Magoichi was a real person from the Sengoku era.  <br/>
If<br/>
memory serves me correctly, and I do not remember where I read it <br/>
although<br/>
it<br/>
was online, he was a captain, or leader in some way, of a gun <br/>
squadron in<br/>
the<br/>
Kii area, and may have been somehow associated with a group of monks <br/>
there.<br/>
Additionally, although it doesn't really matter or apply: He made an<br/>
appearance<br/>
in Capcom's best game ever, Onimusha 2: Samurai's Destiny in a <br/>
supporting<br/>
role, where he is referred to as "captain of the Kiishi Saiga Gun <br/>
Team".<br/>
Hope<br/>
this helps a little.  :-)  Take care.  :-)"<br/>
<br/>
Doing some extra research, but with source I am not sure of the <br/>
reliability,<br/>
I found he is supposed to have as real name Suzuki Shigehide. In <br/>
Turnbull's<br/>
"samurai sourcebook", there is no entry for magoichi but shigehide is<br/>
refered as gunnery expert for hideyoshi whose birth and death dates <br/>
are<br/>
unknow and who fought in Komaki and Nagakute.<br/>
<br/>
If you find any more info (like the origin of suzuki clan), I am <br/>
interested.<br/>
<br/>
