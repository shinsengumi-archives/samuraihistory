<div id="ygrps-yiv-888213867">Hi <br/>
<br/>
I have studied som ewestern archery with a local club<br/>
on and off for a few years now.<br/>
<br/>
In western archery today the (in the UK) there are<br/>
basically two types. Field archery and Taget archery.<br/>
<br/>
Target archery is what you see at the olympics. You<br/>
see the guys with the outstanding bow's all those<br/>
weights and stabilisers. These stop the shudder of the<br/>
bow when you release the arrow. The main emphasis is<br/>
that you get as close to the centre of the target as<br/>
possible. each arrow that hitsone fo them coloured<br/>
circles gets points.<br/>
<br/>
Field archery is where they set up tagets  or animal<br/>
cut outs, you are in wood land and you look for the<br/>
targets. You shoot from a distance and hope to get<br/>
points that would in some cases represent a kill.<br/>
<br/>
One of my students did Japanese archery (kyudo) in<br/>
Japan. He told me that the main emphasis on kyudo was<br/>
the purity of the shot, hitting the target was not<br/>
that important.Its a zen related thing. <br/>
<br/>
Maybe someone on the list had studied Kyudo.<br/>
<br/>
This site <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.kyudo.com/">http://www.kyudo.com/</a> has some great info<br/>
they also wrote a book o the history and development<br/>
of Kyudo which most libraries can obtain<br/>

	I am sure the teacher wants your son to research the <br/>
questions himself. The answer I think is a simple one "The difference <br/>
between western and eastern archery is that in the west the focus is <br/>
on the target in the east the focus is on the shooter..."<br/>

useful. It doesn't answer the question straight away, but might give<br/>
some insight on Japanese archery :)<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-696099251">On the technical side - <br/>
<br/>
Japanese archers draw back to the ear - as did the Greeks - <br/>
other styles, inclusing European, draw back to the nose.<br/>
<br/>
The composite Japanese bow, with a hand-grip a third of the way <br/>
up, is significantly taller than its European counterparts.<br/>
<br/>
The Japanese archer was expected to draw the bow and hold it. <br/>
European archers, notably the British yeomen who in their <br/>
heyday made such a mess of the French aristocracy, nock the <br/>
arrow pointing to the ground. As they draw they swing up and <br/>
back until the right angle is arrived at to rain arrows on <br/>
their foe. <br/>
<br/>
They do not hold the arrow at full draw, but release at the top <br/>
of the arc.<br/>
<br/>
There are some studies of exhumed bones from the period (when I <br/>
think all able-bodied men were obliged to do archery practice) <br/>
that suggest they suffered back injuries from the way they <br/>
trained and handled the bow.<br/>
<br/>
Apart from Robin Hood (?) I don't think the bow ever became an <br/>
heroic weapon, or rather I don't know of an English hero who <br/>
was an archer.<br/>
<br/>
The samurai were, of course, followers of the 'Way of Horse and <br/>
Bow'. They can hold the arrow at full draw, and they developed <br/>
techniques that worked with the physiology rather than against <br/>
it.<br/>
<br/>
[Even though the bow was rapidly superceded by firearms in the <br/>
West, there was still strong support and even after Waterloo <br/>
(1815) it was proposed that companies of archers could support <br/>
the muskets by continuing to fire whilst there was a pause in <br/>
the firing to reload after a volley.<br/>
<br/>
The Brits however mastered the art of rapid load and fire, <br/>
achieving (I believe) the fastest rate of fire in its day, and <br/>
even up to WWI, the traditional 'five rounds rapid' from bolt-action <br/>
rifles convinced the Germans that the Brits were using light <br/>
machine guns.]<br/>
