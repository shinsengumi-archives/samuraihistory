humor<br/>
<br/>
By Laura Kelly <br/>
Staff Writer <br/>
Posted August 20 2004 <br/>
<br/>
Some folks may catch the remake of The Blind Swordsman: Zatoichi for <br/>
its samurai slice-and-dice fighting. A few may go, God help them, <br/>
because they liked Tom Cruise's tired exercise in emotional <br/>
manipulation, The Last Samurai. These people do not know what they're <br/>
in for.<br/>
<br/>
They'll get their swooshing swords and their copious blood. But <br/>
they'll be scratching their heads at Zatoichi's sudden bursts of <br/>
slapstick humor, or when the entire cast partakes in a thunderous tap <br/>
dance.<br/>
<br/>
Could be that only those folks going to see a film by the awesome <br/>
Japanese talent "Beat" Takeshi Kitano will be content with this new <br/>
version of the famous Japanese hero. Kitano audaciously takes on the <br/>
celluloid persona of the blind, justice-seeking swordsman created in <br/>
the 1960s and played for decades by Shintaro Katsu.<br/>
<br/>
Zatoichi's story is taken from the very first Katsu film in the <br/>
1960s, about warring factions in a small town. The blind swordsman <br/>
(played by Kitano) comes to town as a humble masseur and gambler, <br/>
biding his time with the dice-playing nephew of the woman who takes <br/>
him in. Soon, he's in the middle of a gang war.<br/>
<br/>
In Kitano's samurai universe we're given wonderfully flawed and <br/>
dimensional characters. The film is populated with bums and <br/>
prostitutes, guys who hurt themselves because they don't know how to <br/>
hold a sword, put-upon working-class folks, and an idiot or two.<br/>
<br/>
Kitano has the odd ability to appeal to both the art-film lover and <br/>
the action-film fan (though not all of his films are gangster <br/>
flicks). He allows bullets to fly and blood to spurt in the midst of <br/>
silly humor, solid storytelling and stunningly beautiful visuals. <br/>
Like blind Zatoichi's sword sheathed in a rickety old cane, Kitano <br/>
shows us the extraordinary hidden within the ordinary. His Zatoichi <br/>
is no ordinary samurai story. <br/>
