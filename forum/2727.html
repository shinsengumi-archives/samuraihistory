Satsuma Rebellion<br/>
Seinan Senso<br/>
The last major armed uprising against the new Meiji government and its <br/>
reforms. Carried out by former samurai of the Satsuma domain (now <br/>
Kagoshima Prefecture) under the leadership of Saigo Takamori, the <br/>
rebellion lasted from 29 January to 24 September 1877. Its suppression <br/>
proved the effectiveness of the government's new conscript army in <br/>
modern warfare.<br/>
<br/>
The reform program of the government had caused the disestablishment of <br/>
the samurai class, the abolition of their social privileges, a drastic <br/>
reduction of their income, and the destruction of their traditional way <br/>
of life. When their hero, Saigo Takamori, was politically discredited <br/>
and resigned from the government in October 1873 as a result of a <br/>
debate over whether to wage war on Korea , a number of former Satsuma <br/>
samurai left their posts in the army and police force en masse to <br/>
return to Kagoshima with Saigo.<br/>
<br/>
Seizure of arms and ammunition from a naval yard and army munitions <br/>
depot by some of Saigo's followers was the spark that touched off open <br/>
rebellion. Presented with thisfait accompli, Saigo saw no choice but to <br/>
come out of semiretirement to lead a hastily organized and poorly <br/>
equipped rebel army of about 40,000 men.<br/>
<br/>
After a battle between the rebels and the local garrison at Kumamoto <br/>
lasting about 50 days, the arrival of government reinforcements turned <br/>
the tide and forced Saigo's retreat. For the next few months the <br/>
remnants of the Satsuma army fought their way through the mountains of <br/>
southern Kyushu, arriving in Kagoshima with about 400 troops. The <br/>
rebellion came to an end with a last charge by Saigo and his men, <br/>
followed by Saigo's suicide.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
--- and here's something about the end of the Samurai...<br/>
<br/>
The Tokugawa Shogunate (1603�1867) brought peace, which posed problems <br/>
for the ruling samurai class. Some samurai were employed in government, <br/>
but many more became idle stipendaries. In response to these problems <br/>
of the samurai during the peaceful Edo period (1600�1868), <br/>
intellectuals formulated the code of bushido, or the �Way of the <br/>
warrior.� Bushido romanticized the Japanese warrior tradition and <br/>
enjoined samurai to maintain military preparedness.<br/>
<br/>
The visit to Japan in 1853 of a squadron of ships commanded by <br/>
Commodore Matthew Perry of the United States brought Japan's National <br/>
seclusion policy to an end. During the next decade and a half, owing to <br/>
its inability to deal effectively with foreign relations, the shogunate <br/>
was increasingly criticized and attacked, especially by samurai <br/>
opponents within those domains, including Satsuma (now Kagoshima <br/>
Prefecture) and Choshu (now Yamaguchi Prefecture), that had never been <br/>
permitted to participate directly in central government affairs. <br/>
Ultimately there arose in the mid-1860s an imperial-loyalist movement, <br/>
led by lower-level samurai from Satsuma, Choshu, and other domains, <br/>
which branded the shogunate an unworthy government and led to the Meiji <br/>
Restoration of 1868.<br/>
<br/>
The Meiji government, however, could ill afford to continue payment of <br/>
the hereditary samurai stipends; moreover, continuance of the samurai's <br/>
elite warrior status was incompatible with the building of a modern <br/>
conscript army. Dissolution of the samurai class was carried out <br/>
between 1873 and 1876 in a series of measures collectively called <br/>
chitsuroku shobun. Some samurai leaders undertook armed rebellions, the <br/>
last of which�the Satsuma Rebellion�was put down in 1877; others <br/>
founded Western-style political parties and launched a movement for <br/>
representative government.<br/>
<br/>
--- finally...<br/>
<br/>
chitsuroku shobun<br/>
Measures (shobun) adopted by the government in the 1870s to abolish the <br/>
hereditary stipends (chitsuroku) granted to the nobility and members of <br/>
the samurai class immediately after the Meiji Restoration of 1868. In <br/>
1869 the court aristocracy and former daimyo had been classified as <br/>
kazoku, while the former samurai were divided into shizoku or sotsu; <br/>
these status distinctions became the basis for computing the stipends <br/>
to be paid to members of these groups.<br/>
<br/>
By 1871, however, the government began to reconsider the whole stipend <br/>
system. The cost of rice stipends alone constituted 30 percent of total <br/>
government expenses and was diverting essential resources from other <br/>
crucial tasks such as the development of a modern army and navy. As a <br/>
result, the government began to tax the stipends in 1873, and in 1876 <br/>
decreed that all stipends be converted into government bonds called <br/>
kinroku kosai that would not be redeemable for a five-year period. <br/>
These measures were a blow to the former samurai and, together with the <br/>
loss of other feudal privileges, led to a wave of samurai revolts <br/>
culminating in the Satsuma Rebellion of 1877. By 1880 more than half of <br/>
the poorer samurai had sold off their bonds; the nobility and former <br/>
daimyo fared better, many using the bonds as investment capital in the <br/>
newly formed national bank system.<br/>
