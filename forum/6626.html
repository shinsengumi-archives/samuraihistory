<br/>
AKA: Legend of the 8 Samurai; Satomi 8 ken den<br/>
<br/>
Premise: In Japan's mythical past, Princess Shizu, whose clan is <br/>
cursed by evil, is hunted by demons and the samurai armies they <br/>
command, leaving a trail of death behind them. With two warriors <br/>
destined to aid her, she begins a search for six more so that <br/>
together they may destroy the curse and free the land of evil. <br/>
<br/>
Review: Legend of the Eight Samurai had previously been reviewed <br/>
based on the original American version that had been heavily edited <br/>
and stuck with dreadful English dubbing, both of which turned the <br/>
film into a muddled, live-action cartoon. Left unedited and with the <br/>
original Japanese soundtrack, this fantasy jidai geki from yakuza <br/>
film master Kinji Fukasaku becomes an epic fantasy adventure with <br/>
Sonny Chiba and his action team delivering dazzling battles <br/>
sequences, both conventional and otherworldly. Making it even better <br/>
are vampy villains, an early '80s soft rock soundtrack, outrageous <br/>
costumes, and elaborate special effects, culminating in a rollicking <br/>
mix of period samurai action by way of Flash Gordon and Zu: Warriors <br/>
from the Magic Mountain. <br/>
<br/>
Eight Samurai came out at a time when period, costumed dramas in <br/>
Japan were in decline. Director and co-writer Kinji Fukasaku, best <br/>
known for revitalizing the yakuza film in the early '70s with <br/>
stylized depictions of self-destructive anti-heroes, dove into the <br/>
jidai geki arena while envisioning a new breed of samurai film that <br/>
wasn't locked into the well-established conventions of the genre. <br/>
Samurai Reincarnation was his first attempt, yet by his own <br/>
admission, Legend of the Eight Samurai came far closer to matching <br/>
his ambitions. According to author Patrick Macias, it was to have <br/>
been the starting point for a series of films that never emerged, <br/>
despite the relative success of Fukasaku's previous swordplay films. <br/>
<br/>
Eight Samurai is based in part on a series of mythic, 19th century <br/>
tales that were originally adapted into plays, radio programs and <br/>
early films. Co-screenwriter Toshio Kamata stripped down the series' <br/>
innumerable cast of characters and authored a novel that became the <br/>
basis for this film. <br/>
<br/>
One-time pop idols Hiroko Yakushimaru and Hiroyuki Sanada (The <br/>
Twilight Samurai) are paired up respectively as the brave Princess <br/>
Shizu and the brash footman and samurai-wannabe Shinbei, both of <br/>
whom become unlikely lovers caught up in a nightmarish world where <br/>
an eyeball-devouring old witch transforms into a giant centipede and <br/>
demons in human form command armies of murderous samurai and vixens <br/>
who breath and bleed deadly poison. With her clan cursed and wiped <br/>
out by a pair of vengeful souls reincarnated as immortal demons, <br/>
Shizu's only hope is to find eight warriors destined from birth to <br/>
aid her in destroying this evil. This includes the fighting monk <br/>
Dosetsu Inumura (Sonny Chiba) and his gun-totting companion, a <br/>
female assassin for hire (Etsuko Shihomi), a musician, a cave-<br/>
dwelling warrior, a young boy, a remorseful samurai in the demons' <br/>
employ, and Shinbei himself. <br/>
<br/>
Kinji Fukasaku creates a dark, yet vibrant fantasy world with <br/>
colorfully theatric costuming and sets and lots of magical special <br/>
effects from giant, flying serpents that carry their victims away to <br/>
dazzling light effects and pyrotechnics. The lead villains are made <br/>
memorable by scenes (mild by today's standards) of skinning the <br/>
flesh off young women or bathing nude in a bubbling pool of blood. <br/>
<br/>
Implanted among this imagery is the top-notch action choreography of <br/>
Sonny Chiba and his Japan Action Club. After owning the screen in <br/>
the '70s when it came to urban karate action, Chiba had turned his <br/>
sights to the period drama and increasingly, sci-fi or fantasy-<br/>
oriented films like the time-traveling G.I. Samurai (1979). Legend <br/>
of the Eight Samurai is an ambitious work with Chiba's proteges <br/>
Hiroyuki Sanada and Etsuko Shihomi both delivering excellent action <br/>
performances. As an assassin with a love-hate relationship with one <br/>
of the demons and an initial rivalry with one of her peers, Shihomi <br/>
shows off her swordplay skills on numerous occasions. With Chiba in <br/>
a supporting role, Sanada gets the lion's share of the heroic action <br/>
and it's well deserved. Throughout the film, he's seen carrying on <br/>
casual conversations while on a very spirited horse, swinging from <br/>
tree to tree like Tarzan, and deftly wallowing into a mob of <br/>
attackers with twin kama that look like straightened sickles. <br/>
<br/>
There are a number of enjoyable fights, but the heroes' storming of <br/>
the demon castle to save the captured princess is by far the film's <br/>
high point. There is a strong Conan the Barbarian feel to much of <br/>
the film, but particularly here where those giant snakes come into <br/>
play again and our explosives and sword-slinging heroes battle armed <br/>
grunts, traps and sorcery. <br/>
<br/>
The only thing missing from Legend of the Eight Samurai is a <br/>
suitable soundtrack. Rather than go strictly with traditional <br/>
Japanese music, the filmmakers opted for pop music, specifically <br/>
soft rock and a theme song by John O'Banion that could easily fit in <br/>
on a Time-Life compilation with the likes of Foreigner and Jefferson <br/>
Starship. Honestly, I despised it the first time through with the <br/>
American editing and English dubbing. But it works better with the <br/>
original Japanese version and should evoke a sort of nostalgic feel <br/>
for anyone who has fond memories of watching other fantasy movies of <br/>
the era like The Neverending Story and Ladyhawke. <br/>
