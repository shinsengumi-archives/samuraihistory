<div id="ygrps-yiv-1379623362">uesugi kenshin was one of the greatest warlords of sengoku japan.  <br/>
originally named nagao kagetora (i.e. he was from the clan of nagao, <br/>
hereditary retainers of uesugi, the kanto kanrei, based in the province of <br/>
echigo).  when uesugi suffered defeat from other daimyos, mostly hojo, he <br/>
fleed to echigo and asked kagetora to give him asylum.  kagetora agreed on <br/>
the condition he be adopted into uesugi's family and given the surname of <br/>
uesugi.<br/>
<br/>
uesugi pacified most of northern japan, fought a lot of wars with takeda <br/>
shingen, another great warlord, defeated nobunaga in struggle for either <br/>
kaga or echizen and died in unclear circumstances.  ninja attach as well as <br/>
health reasons are cited by different sources.  hope this is helpful.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-513711770">You are welcome, Ubaldo!<br/>
<br/>
I think that a very good source of information is www.samurai-archives.com.  <br/>
This will give you a good basis.  I could also recommend Tony Bryant's web <br/>
page, but do not remember the address.  It comes up often in discussions <br/>
here, watch for it.<br/>
<br/>
Of books, I can recommend Samurai History by Steven Turnbull, it is a good <br/>
start.  There are others, I may get you names later if you have problems <br/>
with this one.<br/>
<br/>
By the way, there was one more Uesugi, who was a sort of "friends" or rather <br/>
an ally of Western forces prior to Sekigahara.  I believe it was Uesugi <br/>
Kagekatsu who could not strike at Tokugawa's because he was tied up by Date <br/>
Masamune from the North and, I think, Maeda Toshie from the West while <br/>
Tokugawa's army made it South to meet the main Western (Mitsunari's) army.  <br/>
Hope this helps.<br/>
