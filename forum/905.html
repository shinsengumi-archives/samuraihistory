<h3>SAMURAI WARRIOR</h3>
by <i>mlp1897</i>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1052050990">I have been searching the web for a poster or a painting of a samurai <br/>
warrior on horseback and wearing a full armour. There are photographs <br/>
of these warriors in annual festivities in Japan but what I would <br/>
like to see and have(if i can afford it) is to have this poster or <br/>
painting. <br/>
Paging anyone.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1336680569">Hi there.<br/>
 Try Mitsuo Kure's book "The Samurai"...It contains a load of photos taken <br/>
during the reenactment battles/Festivals in Japan every year and would <br/>
certainly have a shot like the one you mention you are looking for.<br/>
 There is also www.koryu.com which although it does not have horseback <br/>
samurai photos does have a few photos taken during the Taikai events of <br/>
Martial arts schools like the Yagyu Shingan Ryu where practitioners are <br/>
required to wear full armour during the demonstrations they show.<br/>
 This is a start I guess....The book is available through Amazon.<br/>
 Good luck.<br/>

I have continued to look for pictures of samurai found another link <br/>

clear and there is english Language, it is part of the Yasaki Inari <br/>

Soon I want to create a website focusing on the samurai hats and <br/>

has pics of samurai hats, can be helmets but mostly civilian and <br/>
military head wear.  So if any one has any pictures I would <br/>

Thank You for referring me to the Roald Knutsen website.That's it. Those prints are what I am looking for. Just like the other goldenhearts,"Salamat" and more power to you. May all your tribe increase and populate our world.<br/>

P.S. I will continue browsing on all those websites referred to me particularly samurai archives. Since the 70's also I have read everything my hands can hold on to on Samurai Japan but with the websites and availability of information, it's just fantastic and unbelievable.

<h3>Re: SAMURAI WARRIOR and samurai hats !!!!</h3>
by <i>samurai182uk</i>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-499391822">Thankyou Tony<br/>
<br/>
Your site is excellent and I am a frequent visitor.  The site I was <br/>
interested in making would be more to do with the coolness of the <br/>
hats the style the function the history as well.  But I wanted <br/>
something that shows the coolness of the Japanese as well as the <br/>
history.  I like the basket hats and the peasant hats, the monsho <br/>
used on them, the purpose of hats disguise,anoniymaty, use in snow, <br/>
etc.  Ever since I spoke to someone here in England who kept telling <br/>
me all the historical facts, it was good at first but I admit part of <br/>
the reason I like Japanese society is because it is distinctive, <br/>
cool, strange, fascinating, (isn't that the same with us all anyway)  <br/>
not just because Oda Nobunaga was apparently assasinated by his own <br/>
retainer, although things like that are interesting.  Like you I <br/>
really wanted to get into the heart of the matter.  Like Hiroshiges <br/>
paintings and other things of people in hats.  So soon when my site <br/>
is up people can judge for themselves what the Bushi were like and <br/>
how the society was through it's hats. A bit odd but I like the hats <br/>
very much.  A historian should not be a man who just looks at history <br/>
do you agree? <br/>
<br/>

beaten me to the punch to correct you. Keep the<br/>
questions coming...and 99 times out of 100, Tony's one<br/>
of the best to answer them...<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Pshaw, Nate. You are one of the greensuited few, which in my book<br/>
makes you considerably more than mere mortal. <br/>
<br/>
As we approach the Ever Glorious Fourth, allow me to take a moment to<br/>
thank you for what you do and what you stand for. My expressed<br/>
gratitude is but the merest shadow of what I feel about our men and<br/>
women in green (and blue). <br/>
