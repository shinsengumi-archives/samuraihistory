<h3>could use some help</h3>

<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1975924530">I'm researching the burial practice for samurai. I need to write a <br/>
paper and can't find any info on the net. I've found plenty on <br/>
japanese funeral services but i need to find out if it was the sme <br/>
for the samurai. I've heard of some being buried standingin full <br/>
armour, but believe this was only for those of higher rank. All <br/>
others were cremated. If anyone has any info on this subject i would <br/>
greatly appreciate any help you could offer.<br/>

I cannot point you to a specific book but would look for books on <br/>
religious practice in the Meiji period. At that time there was a <br/>
resurgence of Shinto, a rejection of Buddhism and the influence of <br/>
Western practice. It follows that in a work on the subject, what had <br/>
gone before would be examined as well...-t<br/>
