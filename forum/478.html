<h3>Hattori Hanzo</h3>
by <i>Matthew Dean</i>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1182682652">Hi everyone,<br/>
I'm also trying to find out more about Hattori Hanzo (1541-1596).<br/>
I know that he was a Tokugawa retainer and was also a famous leader of <br/>
ninja. But were they just Iga ninja or a mixture of Iga and Koga ninja?<br/>
Also what was his duties as a retainer? Did he decide battle strategies or <br/>
did they know that he was a leader of ninja and used him because of that? <br/>
and how did he die, I have come across many different stories but I'm trying <br/>
to find the truth if possible.<br/>
<br/>
The Sanada family were also part of a ninja group around this period of time <br/>
with a mixture of ninja's from Iga, Koga and even other schools.<br/>
I was told that they were known as, "The 10 ninja brave" but does anyone <br/>
know of any tasks they completed and any of their names and did Takeda <br/>
Shingen know of them and their use.<br/>
<br/>
Thankyou for any information,<br/>

Here is a quote from stephen Turnbulls book "Ninja"pg80:<br/>
<br/>
"The Iga detachment, which was 200 strong, was under the command of the man who appears in popular works as the most famous ninja of all: Hattori Hanzo Masashige, who had acted as a guide through Iga.  Hanzo, as he is commonly known, had been born in 1541 as the son of Hattori Yasunaga, a hereditary retainer of the tokugawa (or Matsudaira as they were then named).  He fought his first battle at the age of  16 years in the form of a night attack on the castle of Udo in 1557, and went on to serve with distinction at the battles of Anegawa (1570) and Mikata ga hara (1572).  His nickname was Devil Hanzo, to distinguish him from another prominent Mikawa Samurai, Watanabe Hanzo.  As noted by Yamaguchi from Mikawa Monagatori: "Lord Tokugawa's best samurai were hattori Hanzo, (Devil Hanzo); Watanabe Hanzo, (Spear hanzo) and Atsumi Gengo (Headslicer Gengo).<br/>
<br/>
Hattori Hanzo died in 1596 aged 55, and was succeeded by his son Hattori Iwami-no-kami Masanari."<br/>
<br/>
The text goes on to talk about Tokugawa Ieyasu also emplying Koga men but does not discuss whether they were under the command of Hattori Hanzo.  Also of interest is the fact that Hanzo's men became the guards of Edo castle and the Hanzo Gate still bears his name.<br/>
<br/>
Hope this is helpful,<br/>

<h3>Re: Hattori Hanzo</h3>
by <i>umaryu</i>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-713158860">Hi<br/>
<br/>
The sanada connection seems to have been portrayed a lot by the Bogus <br/>
Ninja instructor Harunaka Hoshino from San Fransisco. He claims to be <br/>
a Koga Ninja even though he is of Chinese decent.<br/>
<br/>
i have this on Hanzo <br/>
<br/>
HATTORI RYU<br/>
<br/>
The Hattori Ryu, Momochi Ryu, and Fujibayashi Ryu, were all descended <br/>
from Otomo no Saijin, who himself was a leading member of one of <br/>
Japans highest ranked families. As the Hattori, and Momochi families <br/>
were all commoners they used the same Mon (coat of arms).<br/>
<br/>
Iga Heinaizaemon no jo Ienaga one time, the head of the Hattori <br/>
family, gave permission for his sons to start their own lineage. <br/>
These three were called Hattori Heitaro Koreyuki, Hattori Heijiro <br/>
Yasuyori, and Hattori Heijiro Yasunori. The eldest son Koreyuki, <br/>
called his family 'Kamihattori', the middle son Yasuyori named <br/>
his 'Nakahattori', and the youngest Yasunori, called his <br/>
family 'Shimohattori'. The descendants of the Hattori family <br/>
originated many centuries early from China, and were at that time the <br/>
warlords of many provinces. For this reason they were known by many <br/>
names, amongst which they were known as "Kan Kuni no Kami" (Hattori <br/>
lords of Kan). <br/>
<br/>
Heitaro Koreyuki was the oldest son of Iga no jo Ienaga, and as such <br/>
on his fathers death became the head of the Kamihattori. The <br/>
Kamihattori mon (crest) was known as Yahazu Nihon, or, "The two arrow <br/>
heads". <br/>
<br/>
Heijiro Yasuyori, of the Nakahattori, had ties with the Chinese Go <br/>
province, their Mon was called Ichitomoe, or, "an arc". <br/>
<br/>
Heijiro Yasunori, of the Shimohattori, was also called "Ae Kuni no <br/>
Hattori", (The Hattori of Ae). The Shimohattori Mon was called <br/>
Yaguruma, "The eight arrowheads in a circle". <br/>
<br/>
Hanzo Hattori came from the Kamihattori branch of the Hattori family. <br/>
It is not fully known if he came from the Heitaro or the Chigachi <br/>
line (another branch of the Kamihattori family).<br/>
<br/>
As well as the Hattori family, the Momochi, and Fujibayashi were also <br/>
very prominent within the Ninja schools of Iga.<br/>
<br/>
In 1567, Oda Nobunaga ordered his Samurai to attack the Iga province. <br/>
The three Hattori families Kami, Naka, and Shimo were almost <br/>
destroyed. Only 80 members of these three powerful families survived.<br/>
<br/>
As Iga was no longer safe for their survival, the three branches of <br/>
the Hattori family dispersed to different area's of Japan. The <br/>
Kamihattori fled to Nagaoka in Echigo. The Nakahattori split into two <br/>
groups. One group went to went to Mikawa, to the protection of, and <br/>
work in the service of the  Tokugawa family, the other half of the <br/>
group went to the Oichi family in Takatori, in Yamato. The <br/>
Shimohattori escaped to the safety of the mountains of Takano in <br/>
Kishu.<br/>
<br/>
Hattori Masanari, and his son  Hattori Hanzo (both from the <br/>
Kamihattori), swore allegiance to Tokugawa Ieyasu. Hanzo while <br/>
working for the Tokugawa held the rank of 'Shinobi Metsuke', and he <br/>
had served Ieyasu's grandfather Matsudaira Kiyoyasu. Hanzo later, <br/>
with a friend, Shiro Tarao who was a Koga Ninja, helped Tokugawa <br/>
Ieyasu flee across Japan. They helped get Ieyasu to Okazakijo safely, <br/>
utilising the five ways of fleeing, and by setting up special <br/>
defensive formations along the road, and by using Ninja methods of <br/>
running. This all helped the Tokugawa eventually succeed as Shoguns. <br/>
The Hattori were not "Watari Ninja" (Ninja who moved around from one <br/>
Daimyo to another), they were loyal to the Tokugawa, and remained in <br/>
their service for many generations.<br/>
<br/>
Masanari Hanzo, head of the Hattori family, received his training in <br/>
the martial arts, and Ninjutsu, from his father Hattori Hanzo <br/>
Yasunaga, when he was a child. He virtually grew up in the practice, <br/>
and tradition of the martial arts. <br/>
<br/>
When Tokugawa Ieyasu raided Uzichijo of Mikawa at night, Hanzo was <br/>
young man of 16 years. For the skills that he used during the battle, <br/>
he earned himself a commendation. He was given the name "Hanzo the <br/>
Ghost". Even Ieyasu recognised his skill. Today in the province of <br/>
Kawachi the name Hanzo is still widely in use. In his later years <br/>
Hanzo was also known as "Hanzo the great lancer" (Yari no Hanzo).<br/>
<br/>
Hanzo was placed in charge of the Hassenishi Samurai, and then came <br/>
to be known as "Hattori Hanzo Iwami no Kami".<br/>
<br/>
At one time Hanzo had over 200 Ninja working with him, each held the <br/>
rank of Doshin. He developed problems with these Ninja and he found <br/>
it difficult to control them, and he relieved them of their services. <br/>
He then employed many more Ninja from Iga. Sometime later in his <br/>
life, he became a Monk.<br/>
<br/>
Hanzo Hattori (above) was so famous that in the province of Mikawa <br/>
songs were written about him. One contained these lines:<br/>
<br/>
"Lord Tokugawa has the finest warriors<br/>
Hanzo Hattori is Demon<br/>
Hanzo is Hanzo the Yari"<br/>
<br/>
Some say that Hanzo Hattori met his death on 4th December 1596, while <br/>
trying to bring the Ninja of the Fuma Ryu to justice. The date must <br/>
be wrong as Hanzo helped Ieyasu in the early 1600"s. The story of his <br/>
death says that the Fuma Kainin (he had two protruding teeth), and <br/>
his Fuma Ryu originally came from Kanagawa. In small boats Hanzo and <br/>
his men chased the Fuma out to sea. This was a mistake on the behalf <br/>
of Hanzo as the Fuma were specialists in the use of water, and <br/>
several swam under water, and began dismantling the rudders of the <br/>
boats belonging to Hanzo. As their boats were now disabled Hanzo's <br/>
men decided to jump overboard, and swim to the near by shore. When <br/>
they entered the water, they discovered that the water was covered <br/>
with oil. To which the Fuma Ryu Ninja set fire, killing all of the <br/>
Tokugawa Samurai and Ninja including Hattori Hanzo.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Hope this helps</div>

	the name 'harunaka hoshino' sounds pretty 'Japanezy' to me...  It's<br/>
not a chinese name, unless this is an alias or he changed his name, or is<br/>
half chinese with a japanese father.  heck, i don't even know who this guy<br/>

<br/>
Hoshino claims to be a Koga Ninja grandmaster. He is<br/>
based in San Fransisco USA, anyone in the uSA who is<br/>
serious about Japanese sword should know his name by<br/>
now if not they need to to. He claims to polish baldes<br/>
and appraisee them. Many blades he has polished have<br/>
been destroyed or damaged beyond repair, also a lot of<br/>
blades have never been returned.<br/>
<br/>
there has been discussion about him on several sword<br/>
sites and journals. I think also he may have been<br/>
investigated by USA police departments.<br/>
<br/>
A warning to everyone dont send this many anything<br/>

The criterion version is excellent, the video is clean, the sound has <br/>
been improved, and the optional running comentary is the best I've <br/>
heard on a DVD with the single exception of Das Boot.<br/>
This is opposed to the DVD of RAN, which was a horrible waste of 35$ - <br/>
no features, bad video, and you can't even opt to turn off the <br/>
annoying subtitles....</div>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-387368296">Just about the best film on Samurai that you could buy.<br/>
 Others to watch for also by Akira Kurosawa are; Yojimbo, Throne of Blood, <br/>
Sanjuro, the Hidden fortress, Kagemusha, and Ran..All excellent films and it <br/>
is truly quite incredible that you have'nt heard of the Seven Samurai! Maybe <br/>
the remake of it by Hollywood will ring bells..."Magnificent Seven" (? Seven <br/>
Samurai is far, far, far better as a film but both are excellent to watch.)<br/>
 Yojimbo was also remade as "A fistful of Dollars" by Eastwood/Leone and more <br/>
recently as "Last Man Standing" with B. Willis...The original is of course <br/>
far better though!<br/>

that, but in this one i really wish to know how close<br/>

  I, as a researcher of the past often use all the<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-583532770">Total war is a great game. The mongol invasion is the<br/>
sequel. Its all historically accurate and the strategy<br/>
simulation is great.<br/>
<br/>
Only a few things let it down. You can't controll<br/>
individual man in the fist one, but the sequel has<br/>
better individual A.I <br/>
<br/>
The battles are huge, you can have thousands of<br/>
samurai on the screen, and that might just be your army<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-488136788">well i find the game play to be excellent and it truly<br/>
rewards the use of tactics. <br/>
that being said ....realistic, well depends on how you<br/>
mean it. the unit types  have been altered to fit <br/>
certain roles. i see this especially in the nodachi(<br/>
offense) and naginata troups(defense). the gunners of<br/>
both types are pitifully ineffective. the basic triad<br/>
concept of archer,spear, and calvary strengths and<br/>
weakness works fairly well, though with real ammo<br/>
restrictions the archers are to weaker and they<br/>
already start off a little on the weak side. also in<br/>
making agood army later in the game youll probably<br/>
find your army wont be anything near historical<br/>
proportions of troop types.<br/>
--and shouldnt the takeda capital be able to make<br/>
heavy cav??? come on!!!---<br/>
in all seriousness i think the  flavor and style is<br/>
there: the sounds, battle formations, voices etc., as<br/>
well as a fairly substantial amount of substance; but<br/>
it is first and foremost a game, not a historical<br/>
study.<br/>
<br/>
as a game the variabls used and the calculation of<br/>
each member of a units action are impressive as is the<br/>
ability to pass units through each other with a<br/>
resonable amount of disruption. the effectso f morale<br/>
fatigue and formationalong with unit type demands the<br/>
use of tactics to win. faults, well the computer will<br/>
cheat if you play a campaign.( hint it can borrow and<br/>
go to negative gold, you cannot) the fact that you<br/>
rapidly approach as large of an army as the computer<br/>
can handle means the rest stream in over time as<br/>
reinforcements.(this really hurts the mass # of<br/>
ashigaru strategy,ie it doesnt work) and routing units<br/>
that pass though opposing formed units get a charge<br/>
bonus( that one lone running ashigaru can cut a whole<br/>
right through a formed unit)<br/>
i hope this covers what you werelooking for<br/>
