<h3>Rally round the flag, boys!</h3>

<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-118208124">Would a samurai have ever said that?<br/>
<br/>
The recent mention of kosho brought to mind the question - did the<br/>
standard have the same emotional value as it does in the west?<br/>
<br/>
At Mikatagahara Ieyasu was 'obliged' to leave the field; his father<br/>
was once 'sent to the rear' when things got tough and a Honda took his<br/>
place and fell in battle.<br/>
<br/>
Would the standards be likewise sent back with the daimyo, or would<br/>
they stay and make their stand? When Ieyasu was given a banner of the<br/>
Pure Land sect, would that be a raalying point for his followers? <br/>
<br/>
Again in the west when facing the impossible, the colours were sent to<br/>
the rear (a great morale boost, I'm sure!) as there was dishonour in<br/>
allowing the colours to fall into enemy hands.<br/>
<br/>
Is it Kagemusha in which the defeat army throw their banners down and<br/>
retreat? (I can picture the image, but not the film).<br/>
<br/>
Just a curiosity. I've never come across this.<br/>
<br/>
Except, of course, the planting of the flag in Seven Samurai - this is<br/>
probably the kind of thing I'm wondering about.<br/>
<br/>
And if the standard did not have an equivalant emotive value, was<br/>
there anything, apart from the person of the commander, that did?<br/>
<br/>
And again, there is a famous tale of a clash between samurai and sohei<br/>
in which the samurai fired an arrow at the portable shrine carried by<br/>
the monks (so famous it completely escapes me) which might be read in<br/>
a similar vein.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>The story is about Taira Kiyomori and his men. (from the Samurai <br/>
Archives website)<br/>
<br/>
"In one celebrated (and possibly apocryphal) event in 1146, one of <br/>
his men insulted the head priest of Kyoto's Gion Shrine, prompting a <br/>
large group of warrior monks to march on the city and demand <br/>
Kiyomori's chastisement. Kiyomori rode out and to the shock of all <br/>
present, shot an arrow into their mikoshi, a decided act of <br/>
sacrilege that did have the effect of scattering the monks."<br/>
