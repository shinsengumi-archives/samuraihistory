    Tokugawa Hideyoshi gave the Himeji castle (it is also know as Shirasagi (White Egret)), to Ikeda Terumasa after defeating Toyotomi's armies.  It was then occupied by 48 succeeding Lords. Could anyone thro any light on their names please.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1754057735">After Ikeda,<br/>
Honda Tadamasa  1617-39<br/>
Matsudaira Tadaaki and his son Tadahiro 1639-49<br/>
Matsudaira Naomoto and his son Naohiro 1648-49<br/>
Sakakibara Tadatsugu and his son Masafusa 1649-82<br/>
Honda Tadakuni and his son Tadataka 1682-1704<br/>
Sakakibara Masakuni 1704-1749<br/>
Sakai Tadasumi 1749-succeeded by eight descendants until the Bakumatsu<br/>
period.<br/>
<br/>
These are the names I could find I think that there are more names but I<br/>
believe these are the families that ruled Himeji-Jo during the Edo period.<br/>
By the way it was Tokugawa Ieyasu that bestowed the castle onto Ikeda,<br/>
Toyotomi Hideyoshi was the hegemon that ruled before Tokugawa<br/>
