<div id="ygrps-yiv-2009585206"><blockquote><span title="ireply">>Hi everyone,<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Murakami Haruki was discussed here fairly recently so i won't say too <br/>
much about him except he is one of the most widely translated and <br/>
popular living Japanese writers. I love his early books like Dance, <br/>
Dance, Dance and The Hardboiled Wonderland and the End of the <br/>
World. <br/>
<br/>
I think it's really important in coming to understand a culture to read <br/>
widely in its literature - especially if you want to write about it. I was <br/>
reminded again last night, watching Aoyama's film Eureka, how <br/>
different Japanese narrative style is from Western - which is why some <br/>
people find Japanese novels hard going. It's worth thinking yourself <br/>
into the necessary different mindset. And just to try reading in kanji is <br/>
worth it too, to realise the vividness and graphic nature of this way of <br/>
writing.<br/>
<br/>
Lili and the other writers, I've had a sort of historical fantasy published <br/>
recently set in an alternative mediaeval world based on Japan. It's <br/>
under the pseudonym Lian Hearn and is called Tales of the Otori. Our <br/>
excellent moderator was kind enough to post the first chapter of the <br/>
first book some time ago. If there's anything I can help you with in <br/>
discussing some of the issues involved in writing this sort of novel <br/>
perhaps you would like to contact me off board. I'm going away in 10 <br/>
days but will try to reply before then.<br/>
<br/>
Cheers,<br/>

works in italian.<br/>
<br/>

 </span></blockquote>It is so. I think it's very interesting to compare the<br/>
cultures, and to understand the differences, the<br/>
common points, or the affinity.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
It's worth<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I've never try that, but I think that is very<br/>
difficult. <br/>

<br/>
Rami, I agree with all you say.<br/>
<br/>
Won't write more on this theme as it's not strictly samurai history!<br/>
