<h3>Greetings, Apologies, and Urgent Questions</h3>
by <i>natashacompagnon</i>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1454000984">Hello!<br/>
<br/>
I joined this list a few days ago, because I am interested in the <br/>
topic (really, Japanese history and culture in general) and because I <br/>
am writing an essay having to do with samurai. I want to apologize <br/>
for asking questions before reading the archives, but the searches I <br/>
ran didn't turn up anything on my subject.<br/>
<br/>
I'm writing about Heihachiro Oshio's manifesto and rebellion in the <br/>
1830s. I have a copy of the manifesto, some information on the <br/>
historical context, and a little on the revolt and its aftermath. I <br/>
was wondering if anyone knew about this matter and would be willing <br/>
to discuss it. The essay is just overdue now, and I must turn it in <br/>
in the next day or so, but I'd appreciate anything you'd be willing <br/>
to share.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Thank you,<br/>
<br/>
<br/>

Ivan Morris includes Oshio Heihachiro in The Nobility of Failure. I wonder if you have read this? In it he remarks on Oshio's influence on Saigo Takamori and his unique role in Japanese history in seeking justice for the common people.<br/>
<br/>
Cheers,<br/>

 </span></blockquote>I hadn't read it, actually ... I'd come across the review, and wanted <br/>
to read the book for Oshio and the chapter on Amakusa Shiro, but I'd <br/>
forgotten. Once you reminded me, I went to the library and checked <br/>
out the book. It was quite helpful, thank you - and thank you again, <br/>
since Amakusa Shiro is a personal interest of mine. I learned quite a <br/>
bit. <br/>
<br/>
