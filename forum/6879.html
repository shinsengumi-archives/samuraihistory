 </span></blockquote>Kaburaya (whistleing arrow) ia a sort of arrow whose tip has hollow<br/>
whistle made with hard stuffs like antler and a kind of magnolia.  It<br/>
was originally used to scare quarries by hunters and in Heian and<br/>
Kamakura era, when riding archers had tactical importance,  war was<br/>
begun with shout and exchange of kaburaya shooting.  Gradually<br/>
riding archers had given its importance to infantry,  kaburaya dissaperaed<br/>
in Muromachi era.<br/>
<br/>
Nowadays, kaburaya is used in Yabusame that is samurai mounted<br/>
archery rite dedicated to some shintou shrines.<br/>
