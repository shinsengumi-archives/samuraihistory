A time of peace, exquisitely rendered, at the Coolidge Center<br/>
<br/>
By LAURA POPE<br/>
Arts Writer<br/>
 <br/>
Gov. Benning Wentworth, as a leading member of early Portsmouth high <br/>
society, no doubt exulted in the luxurious 52-room splendor of his <br/>
sprawling mansion perched on Portsmouth's Little Harbor in the 18th <br/>
century. <br/>
<br/>
Meanwhile, a world away in Japan, the populace were in the midst of <br/>
a new, pleasure-driven Edo period (1598 ¿ 1854), sparked by the rule <br/>
of a new Shogun who closed the borders of the heretofore war-ravaged <br/>
nation that soon became prosperous and peaceful.<br/>
<br/>
Tying these two far-flung, 18th century societies together  the new <br/>
colony in New Hampshire and the ancient one in Asia, came swiftly to <br/>
Dody Kolb, the director of the Coolidge Center for the Arts, located <br/>
steps away from Benning's homestead, now called the Wentworth-<br/>
Coolidge mansion.<br/>
<br/>
"I thought about the Portsmouth Peace Treaty and then quickly linked <br/>
that to the peaceful era of Japan that unfolded during the time Gov. <br/>
Wentworth lived here," recalled the North Hampton art historian, <br/>
collector and curator. "I thought of peace evolving across the <br/>
waters; the 1905 peace treaty itself here in Portsmouth and the <br/>
peace that took hold of a warrior nation. As the prints were <br/>
evolving in Japan from the 1600 to 1800s, the Wentworth mansion went <br/>
up here. It seemed a good fit; the show is about peace and what <br/>
people do in a time of peace."<br/>
<br/>
The result of Kolb's brainstorm is an ambitious exhibit of 50 to 60 <br/>
prints rendered by as many as 20 artists called "Peace and the <br/>
Pursuit of Pleasure" which opens Sunday, August 21 through September <br/>
5. Additionally, Kolb has added several informational panels to <br/>
supplement the prints. These panels will inform viewers about <br/>
printmaking techniques of the period and specific artists <br/>
represented in the exhibit.<br/>
<br/>
Surviving artifacts of this age in the form of Japanese woodblock <br/>
prints ¿ called Ukiyo-e  depict figures such as sumo wrestlers, <br/>
kabuki actors and courtesans, surface as rare and distinct <br/>
expressions of art "showing the many pleasures enjoyed by this <br/>
society during the 18th and 19th centuries, a time of peace." <br/>
<br/>
Created through the "concerted effort of artist, woodblock carver, <br/>
printer and publisher," said Kolb, "these prints reflect a fleeting <br/>
world when the emerging middle class pursued harmonious and festive <br/>
activities." During this peaceful period of time, samurai were still <br/>
the prevailing class, though merchants suddenly came into view as <br/>
the leading edge in a new wave of middle class professions.<br/>
<br/>
How Kolb came to know about this particular era speaks to her long <br/>
association with Japanese art. The daughter of English parents, Kolb <br/>
studied art history and painting at three colleges, including King's <br/>
College in Cambridge. In the 1970s, she fell in love with Edo period <br/>
Japanese woodblock prints when her son, working at the antiques show <br/>
at Brimfield, spotted them in the adjacent booth.<br/>
<br/>
"I bought two prints at that time by famed artist, Ando Hiroshige <br/>
(1707 ¿ 1858). This immediately opened my eyes to this wondrous <br/>
world. I was enthralled with the colors, forms and images of <br/>
another, more exotic life. Eventually, I researched the UNH <br/>
collection of Japanese prints in the mid-1980s as they have a <br/>
fabulous collection with a strong theatre or kabuki component."<br/>
<br/>
A whopping 80 percent of the Coolidge show is taken from Kolb's own <br/>
collection of Edo prints; the remainder were loaned by collectors <br/>
she met over the decades. <br/>
<br/>
The avid collector has long been a presence in the Seacoast and <br/>
state, serving 10-year terms on the UNH Art Gallery Board of <br/>
Advisors and on the Advisory Council for the Currier Museum of Art <br/>
in Manchester.<br/>
<br/>
Sitting in her office at the Coolidge Center, Kolb enjoys a good <br/>
laugh remembering her one month of retirement before taking the role <br/>
as director of the art gallery.<br/>
<br/>
"I had worked for years as the art consultant to the Home Center and <br/>
Rye and had retired for 30 days," she reminisced. "Then four years <br/>
ago, Sumner Weinbaum came looking for me. This gallery had served as <br/>
the carriage house to the Wentworth mansion but when I arrived it <br/>
sported a dirty, cement garage floor." The spacious gallery where <br/>
Kolb presides is home to several exhibits each year, featuring most <br/>
prominently the works of noted painters.<br/>
<br/>
Extolling the beauty of Ukiyo-e prints made possible by Tokugawa <br/>
Shogun Iayasu, Kolb enthuses: "These prints represent art made for <br/>
masses, art that was sold on street corners." She added that when <br/>
Commodore Perry arrived in Japan in 1854, after the ports had re-<br/>
opened, the unified style of the Edo period came to an end. "Once he <br/>
arrived, the prints and many other Japanese art forms <br/>
were 'discovered' in the West and so began the great exporting of <br/>
goods, changed often to suit western tastes." <br/>
<br/>
Her particular fondness for the works of Hiroshige are evident. "I <br/>
like the quiet eye and the solace you find in his work. He reveals <br/>
an insightful, quiet nature in his prints while the others are much <br/>
more ebullient." <br/>
<br/>
This rare, 15-day showing of Edo prints at the Coolidge Center for <br/>
the Arts, taken together with the display of lithographs (War and <br/>
Peace: Images from the Russo-Japanese War, 1904-05) at the <br/>
Portsmouth Athenaeum and the Peace Show at the Levy Gallery, will <br/>
give art lovers a broad spectrum of displays to ogle during the <br/>
Peaceful Month of August, designated as such to honor the Treaty of <br/>
Portsmouth, which ended the war between Japan and Russia." <br/>
<br/>
Kolb is following up the Japanese print exhibit with one <br/>
entitled "The Power of the Print" which will display all formats in <br/>
printmaking from block and etching to mixed media.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
The Coolidge Center for the Arts opens daily from 10 a.m. to 5 p.m. <br/>
and welcomes the public to attend, free of charge. There are guided <br/>
tours of the displays on Wednesdays at 1 p.m. and by appointment for <br/>
large groups. The Coolidge Center for the Arts is located at 375 <br/>
Little Harbor Road in Portsmouth, 436-6607.</div>
