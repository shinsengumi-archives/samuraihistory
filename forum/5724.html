<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> > What in the hell possessed them to use some nobody like this guy? <br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>       That's PRECISELY why they used him!  Because there IS nothing on him.  <br/>
Let me ask for the sake of asking: Which is easier to make a hero: A nobody <br/>
on whom there is little to no information where there is freedom to draw a <br/>
character or a well-known personage whose history is well-known and whose every <br/>
little iota would be scrutinized indefinitely?  I think it was easier for them <br/>
to turn Nobunaga to a villain than it would have been to portray Mitsuhide as <br/>
the hero, despite his bit part toward the end of the third game.<br/>
       Making Nobunaga or Kinoshita Tokichiro (the then-future Toyotomi plays <br/>
a monkey-like henchman in the first two games and makes only a brief <br/>
appearance at the very, very end of the post-credit movies of the third as Toyotomi) <br/>
the hero would have defeated the game out of the blocks.  Producer Inafune <br/>
Keiji's stated goal in an interview with BradyGames after the second game was to <br/>
portray the lesser-known (or accepted) and -- shall we say -- not quite so <br/>
honourable side of Nobunaga.  I mean, is not Nobunaga looked upon as a great <br/>
figure in Japanese history?  Seriously, I'm asking.  How is Akechi Mitsuhide viewed <br/>
in relation to the man he brought down from the Japanese point of view?<br/>
       Another name -- Mori Ranmaru -- was brought in as Nobunaga's top <br/>
henchman for the third game.  But he is really the only other recognizable name in <br/>
either game.<br/>
       The middle game (Onimusha: Samurai's Destiny) had not one but FOUR <br/>
nobodies or lesser-lights in possible big roles including Yagyu Jubei -- pulled <br/>
from his time period (1605?-16??) -- as the hero.  I've found a TOTAL of ONE <br/>
decent article on him, though respected swordsman he may have been.  The heroine <br/>
in that game -- Oyu -- turned out to be O-ichi, Nobunaga's sister, the only <br/>
really recognizable name apart from Tokichiro and Nobunaga.  The other guys?  <br/>
Ankokuji Ekei, Saiga (Saigo) Magoichi and Fuma Kotaro?  There isn't much more <br/>
on them.  If ANY.  And besides, every one of the real-life characters in the <br/>
Onimusha game -- including Samanosuke and Mori Ranmaru -- were dead before Yagyu <br/>
Jubei was BORN!  Some for more than 30 years!  (Asai Nagamasa is referenced <br/>
only a couple of times in the game, and Shibata Katsuie not at all.)  A derth <br/>
of nobodies probably accounts for his use.  I think the second game is the best <br/>
in the series, and I do NOT think, despite Inafune Keiji's comments, that <br/>
Onimusha 3: Demon Seige will be the last chapter we'll see in the Onimusha <br/>
series.<br/>
       Some may remember my question to Tony sometime ago about a possible <br/>
alt-history romance starring O-ichi.  Onimusha 2: Samurai's Destiny was the <br/>
inspiration for that question.<br/>
       Anyway, enough mindless prating for now.  :-)  Take care, y'all.  :-)<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Granted. However, understand my frustration when every<br/>
Electronic Samurai who playes Onimusha 47 and thinks<br/>
Akechi Samanosuke is some major, important person,<br/>
comes here wants information on him when very little<br/>
exists. He's irrelevant. Not important. A Nobody.<br/>
"Third guy from left" in the credits of the Sengoku<br/>
era. <br/>
<br/>
   I mean, is not<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Depends on who you ask, of course. Most sane people<br/>
view Nobunaga as a man with tons of ambition, who<br/>
wanted to solidify control of Japan and didn't let<br/>
anything, including accepted moral standards or<br/>
expected behaviours, stand in his way. He's a classic<br/>
case of "Ends justifies the means", and MOST people<br/>
accept that.<br/>
<br/>
Mitsuhide is equally complex. Some view him as the<br/>
archetypal traitor, others view him as the only person<br/>
with the courage to stand up to a bullying tyrant. I<br/>
think he's a poor, pathetic man, a tactical genius,<br/>
but one who simply got pushed too far by his lord's<br/>
treatment of him, and who went over the edge,<br/>
mentally. He reacted emotionally, without thorough<br/>
planning and solidifying a base, and so was swallowed<br/>
up by history when Hideyoshi came and defeated him. <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
 The other guys?  <br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> > Ankokuji Ekei, Saiga (Saigo) Magoichi and Fuma<br/>
> Kotaro?  There isn't much more <br/>
> on them.  If ANY.  <br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Actually, there is plenty on Ankokuji Ekei, at least. <br/>
<br/>
And besides, every one of the<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> > real-life characters in the <br/>
> Onimusha game -- including Samanosuke and Mori<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>This is why I hate it when people play these games,<br/>
and then try to equate it to historical knowledge.<br/>
This is the same problem I have with Rurouni<br/>
Kenshin--IT'S NOT REAL. No matter how "realistic" any<br/>
of this may be, it's simply NOT. Put down your XBOX<br/>
controller and pick up a history book, PLEASE. Don't<br/>
get me wrong--nothing is inherently wrong with these<br/>
games, or anime. But dammit, they ain't history. If<br/>
you do a Google search on "Akechi Samanosuke" and<br/>
99.9% of the hits come up as references to a video<br/>
game, that ought to give you a clue that a. he's not<br/>
real, or b. if he is real, he wasn't that darn<br/>
important. <br/>

<h3>Akechi Mitsuhide</h3>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I disagree with a number of your assertions.  Mitsuhide might not <br/>
have been a master manipulator of men like Hashiba (later Toyotomi) <br/>
Hideyoshi, but his revolt against Nobunaga was reasonably well <br/>
planned and carried out.<br/>
<br/>
That he miscalculated in who might be willing to ally with him <br/>
subsequent to killing Nobunaga only became fully clear in the days <br/>
after the Akechi rose up against the Oda.  He did count on support <br/>
from the Hosokawa of Wakasa and the Tsutsui of Yamato.  In the end <br/>
neither clan committed to the cause of an isolated lord who was now <br/>
infamous for murdering his master.  Naturally, the fact that both <br/>
Hideyoshi as well as Shibata Katsuie (both commanding greater <br/>
resources and larger armies than the Akechi) were bound to attempt to <br/>
destroy Nobunaga's murderer as a first step to gaining a preeminent <br/>
position in the Oda domains would make lesser daimyo hesitant to ally <br/>
with Mitsuhide.  Mitsuhide was counting on both of these generals <br/>
being tied down in campaigns, and in the case of Katsuie (who was <br/>
delayed due to his campaign in Etchu) he was at least partially <br/>
right.  However, upon learning of Nobunaga's death, Hideyoshi quickly <br/>
concluded a peace treaty with the Mori and force marched on Kyoto.  <br/>
In essence, Mitsuhide was frustrated on two fronts, he was unable to <br/>
find allies and his time horizon narrowed much more rapidly than he <br/>
had expected.<br/>
<br/>
But Mitsuhide's lack of success was not for lack of planning or <br/>
effort.  He did, in fact, court both the Mori as well as the Tokugawa <br/>
clans.  And, to tell the truth, I do find it a little odd that the <br/>
Mori were content to abide by the treaty they signed with Hideyoshi <br/>
when it was clear that they would very likely have been able to at <br/>
the least reverse their losses over the previous four or five years.  <br/>
The Tokugawa would become embroiled in conflict with Hideyoshi <br/>
subsequent to Mitsuhide and Katsuie's fall.  Which again does not <br/>
entirely make sense from a strategic point of view.  Though of course <br/>
Ieyasu began hostilities against Hideyoshi only after he had formed <br/>
an alliance with Oda Nobuo (a son of Nobunaga) and thus no one could <br/>
question his motives or his honor.  Nevertheless, though he was never <br/>
actually defeated by Hideyoshi, Ieyasu was, in the end, forced to <br/>
make peace on the latter's terms due both to the ineptitude of Nobuo <br/>
as well as Hideyoshi's sizeable advantage in resources and men.  Had <br/>
Ieyasu allied with Katsuie or for that matter even with Mitsuhide he <br/>
would likely have been able to forestall the rise of Hideyoshi to <br/>
supremacy in Japan.</div>

 </span></blockquote>The attack on the Honno-ji was masterfully carried<br/>
out, I fully grant. Everything after that smacks of a<br/>
"okay....what do I do now?" feel. <br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> > That he miscalculated in who might be willing to<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Ah, but rather than make any attempt to garner their<br/>
support BEFORE he acted, he acted and then assumed<br/>
he'd get their support. You can argue that if he had<br/>
tried to get support first, he may have missed his<br/>
chance, or even risked being found out, but the fact<br/>
remains that he acted first, thought later. <br/>
<br/>
 Mitsuhide was counting on both of<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> > these generals <br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I'm not arguing that he could have anticipated<br/>
Hideyoshi's moves--Hideyoshi's peace with the Mori and<br/>
subsequent march was nothing short of amazing.<br/>
However, even if Hideyoshi had been held up longer by<br/>
the Mori, Mitsuhide needed to get the daimyo of<br/>
central Japan under his leadership, and quickly. He<br/>
didn't. Once Nobunaga and Nobutada were dead, it was<br/>
as if he didn't know what to do next. Sacking Azuchi<br/>
appears to me like he had nothing else in mind. Azuchi<br/>
wasn't important, except possibly as a symbol. Symbols<br/>
could be dealt with later--what was important was<br/>
finding and killing Ieyasu, solidifying Hosokawa,<br/>
Tsuitsui, Takayama, and Niwa's support, and preparing<br/>
for the eventual attack of either Shibata or<br/>
Hideyoshi, whichever came first. <br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> > But Mitsuhide's lack of success was not for lack of<br/>
> planning or <br/>
> effort.  He did, in fact, court both the Mori as<br/>
> well as the Tokugawa <br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>It was a masterful plan to eliminate his tormentor. It<br/>
was nowhere near sufficient to take his place. Had<br/>
that been his motive, he would have made moves long<br/>
before to secure support. He didn't. <br/>
<br/>
And, to tell the truth, I do find it a<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> > little odd that the <br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Perhaps. But I think the Mori were content to keep<br/>
what they had because they were exhausted by<br/>
Hideyoshi. <br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> > The Tokugawa would become embroiled in conflict with<br/>

> subsequent to Mitsuhide and Katsuie's fall.  Which<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Why not? Hideyoshi's position at Nagakute wasn't<br/>
overwhelmingly commanding. With a little luck and some<br/>
exceptional diplomacy, Ieyasu could have possibly<br/>
overcome Hideyoshi. His appeals to the Chosokabe and<br/>
Mori simply didn't work out. Ieyasu was as important<br/>
to Hideyoshi's success as he was to Nobunaga's--born<br/>
out by the fact that Hideyoshi had to offer up the<br/>
Kanto to him. <br/>
<br/>
 Nevertheless,<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> > though he was never <br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I won't argue Nobuo's ineptitude. <br/>
<br/>
 Had <br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> > Ieyasu allied with Katsuie or for that matter even<br/>
> with Mitsuhide he <br/>
> would likely have been able to forestall the rise of<br/>
> Hideyoshi to <br/>
> supremacy in Japan.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Now THIS is an interesting what if. <br/>
<br/>
Anyways, back to the main point: it boils down to 2<br/>
options. Either Mitsuhide revolted and attacked<br/>
Nobunaga for the express purpose of killing Nobunaga<br/>
out of accumulated torment, or he attacked the most<br/>
powerful man in Japan in order to supplant him. If<br/>
it's option 1, he was wildly successful. If it's<br/>
option 2, he's a pathetic failure. Mitsuhide wasn't<br/>
incompetent (if anything at times he was TOO competent<br/>
for Nobunaga's tastes), so my opinion is that his sole<br/>
focus was revenge on Nobunaga for the hell he had been<br/>
put through. Only afterward was there thought of what<br/>
to do afterwards, and the possibility of supplanting<br/>
him. <br/>
