<h3>KYOTOOOOOOOO!!!!</h3>
by <i>cepooooo</i>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-601661002">Hi there, gang.<br/>
I am definitely going to Kyoto during spring break (approx March 19th <br/>
to 26th), to get some books for my research. I was thinking: since a <br/>
few of this list are in Japan, wouldn't be nice to get together for <br/>
some serious historical sightseeing, to be completed with an historical <br/>
food+booze session at an izakaya in the old capital?? If there are a <br/>
few of us (and we're willing to invest a little) I can try to get a <br/>
couple of my maiko friends to come around for a reasonable price - no <br/>
kidding!!! :oO<br/>
I know some of you are in Kanto, but....c'mon... I am flying 7 hours <br/>
from Honolulu; can't you hop on a shinkansen??<br/>

March 19 to the 26 you say. I have some days off from my school on 20-21 and<br/>
25-31. However its a busy season with the new school year starting in April.<br/>
The best time for me might be Sunday the 21st. Getting to Kyoto is no<br/>
problem; its only a 30 minute train ride.<br/>
