<div id="ygrps-yiv-128914256">I bid you all greetings, I have just arrived but I will just into the <br/>
present question without delay.<br/>
<br/>
Of the research I have done in the fields of War, politcial, milatary <br/>
and cultural history of Japan there is very little dispute that it <br/>
was in fact Kenshin, some sources even have him named Kagetoura, but <br/>
indeed they did meet though, face to face only that once. <br/>
<br/>
I hope that was of some help, though it may not have been as <br/>
discriptive as it could have been<br/>

<h3>Re: 4th Kawanakajima</h3>

<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1478253626">I find it very doubtful.  I finally got myself a copy of the 'Koyo <br/>
Gunkan' - I have the book 'legends of the Samurai', and I found it in <br/>
the bibliography and ordered it off Amazon.co.jp (Koyo Gunkan, Edited <br/>
and translated into modern Japanese by Yukata Yoshida).  It has both <br/>
the original text and the modern japanese 'translation'.  I can't <br/>
hope to read the original text, but the 'modern' japanese version <br/>
says: "Ato de kikeba, kono Musha koso Terutora de atta to iu."  That <br/>
doesn't sound too convincing to me.  Here is a translation I did from <br/>
another book, "Sengoku Bushou Omoshiro Jiten", Naramoto Tatsuya, 1998:<br/>
<br/>
"This is the same famous scene from books and movies; The warrior in <br/>
the white cowl is Kenshin, and Shingen's warfan bore eight sword <br/>
cuts.  However, there are historical records that have been <br/>
discovered that dispute this personal combat.  It is the 'Kenshin <br/>
Nenpu' (Kenshin Chronological Record), which states Arakawa Izu no <br/>
Kami rides at Shingen, shingen cant draw his sword and instead blocks <br/>
with his fan, and Hara Oosumi no Kami steps forward with a spear and <br/>
strikes at the rider, missing him but hitting the horse, startling <br/>
it.  The rider fled"<br/>
<br/>
It goes on to say:<br/>
<br/>
"In short, it is thought that the man that Shingen fought at <br/>
Kawanakajima was Kenshin's kagemusha, Arakawa Izu no Kami.  Also, <br/>
according to the "Hokuetsu Gunki", Shingen recieved a visit from a <br/>
monk by the name of Tenkai who would later become and advisor to <br/>
Ieyasu, and he told him that "the man who crossed swords with Kenshin <br/>
was not me, but someone who looks like/resembles me."<br/>
<br/>
So Shingen said that it was his Kagemusha that fought with Kenshin, <br/>
not himself.  Therefore, there is also the possiblity that they were <br/>
BOTH kagemusha.  Kenshin and Shingen were both worthy opponents who <br/>
had never seen eachother's face.  That may have also added to the <br/>
confusion as well.  Although the personal combat between Kenshin and <br/>
Shingen is recorded in the Koyo Gunkan, however in truth, there isn't <br/>
any evidence to support this."<br/>
<br/>
Based on the above, you have to wonder if Kenshin and Shingen ever <br/>
really DID fight...<br/>
<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1360425506">Hey there, y'all.<br/>
  It's me again.  Just wondering something.  In some of the things I have <br/>
read, although where escapes me, I have seen it attributed to Uesugi Kenshin <br/>
and Takeda Shingen that they were great rivals with each other.  The evidence <br/>
y'all have presented paints a somewhat different picture.  Did they ever <br/>
battle each other than the Kawanakajima series of battles?  And another <br/>
question: what's a Kagemusha?  (Or an "onimusha" for that matter -- other <br/>
than the incredible video game series.)  And this Arakawa Izu no Kami -- am I <br/>
correct, from what I've learned from the Samurai Archives site, in <br/>
translating this to mean Arakawa, Lord of Izu?  Just wondering.  :-)  Thanks, <br/>
y'all.  Y'all are a wonderful help to me to understand this fascinating <br/>
period and place in history, especially since the story I'm writing's set in <br/>
it.  :-D  Thanks again.  :-D<br/>
<br/>
Later.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-397995656">Kagemusha: Basically, it's a body double. Saddam Hussein is currently famous for having<br/>
about ten kagemusha who make public appearances for him so he doesn't have to take the<br/>
risks.<br/>
<br/>
There's a scene in Henry IV, Part Two during a battle where Hotspur, wondering where the<br/>
king is, rages that he has killed four Henrys already yet hasn't found the king.<br/>
Apparently, it's an old trick. <G><br/>
