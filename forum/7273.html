<br/>
Delicate negotiations between British museum curators and a Japanese <br/>
shrine have unlocked a 400-year-old chest of sacred art, which goes <br/>
on show today under the supervision of Shinto priests. <br/>
Paintings on gold leaf and minute instructions about military <br/>
etiquette in a savage civil war will be on display for three months <br/>
at the Royal Armouries in Leeds, along with a spidery letter from <br/>
the English sea-pilot William Adams, whose story inspired the best-<br/>
selling novel Shogun. <br/>
<br/>
The exhibition tells the story of Lord Tokugawa Ieyasu, the 17th-<br/>
century unifier of Japan who took the title Shogun and was later <br/>
declared a god. The status of objects such as a vast gold fan which <br/>
he carried at his many battles led to years of negotiations over <br/>
their first loan for showing abroad. <br/>
"It has been a triumph for international cooperation," said Paul <br/>
Evans, chief executive of the Royal Armouries, which will return a <br/>
number of the most delicate artworks after only six weeks as their <br/>
fragile condition requires limited exposure to light. <br/>
<br/>
"It has called on all the expertise, diplomacy and determination of <br/>
the staff of the Royal Armouries and the Nikko Toshogu shrine <br/>
(dedicated to the Shogun) to bring to life the story of a great <br/>
man." <br/>
<br/>
Launched yesterday with a hair-raising display of Yabusame, the high-<br/>
speed mounted archery which won Tokugawa's battles, the exhibition <br/>
also shows the mismatch in understanding between Japan and the west <br/>
for centuries. In spite of the presence of men such as Adams, an <br/>
Armada war veteran who advised the Shogun on naval policy, ignorance <br/>
was sometimes spectacular. <br/>
<br/>
The exhibition includes a presentation suit of armour sent by the <br/>
Shogun to England's King James I which within 30 years was <br/>
catalogued at the Tower of London as "a gift from the Great Moghul" <br/>
(of India). Even greater indignities were inflicted on similar suits <br/>
sent to the court in Austria, where they were reclassified for <br/>
diplomatic purposes to do with the conquest of Mexico as "having <br/>
belonged to Montezuma and his son". <br/>
<br/>
Shogun is at the Royal Armouries until August 30</div>
