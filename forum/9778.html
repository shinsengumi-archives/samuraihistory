<div id="ygrps-yiv-117737235">Why Kawanakajima? Shingen and Kenshin's Five Battles<br/>
<br/>
Sengoku Daimyo Takeda Shingen and Uesugi Kenshin are two well known<br/>
figures from Japan's Sengoku period who fought five battles on the<br/>
Kawanakajima plain in Shinano province (Modern day Nagano prefecture)<br/>
between 1553 and 1564. (The fouth battle was depicted in the 1990<br/>
Kadokawa Haruki movie Heaven and Earth) Why did Kawanakajima become<br/>
the main battleground for these two warriors? What made Kawanakajima<br/>
such a contested area? I thought I'd tackle this question for my blog<br/>
post this week. After a combination of poking around and deductive<br/>
reasoning, I can come up with a few reasons. Although, there is no way<br/>
to really know which reasons might be correct, a little theoretical<br/>
guesswork never hurt anyone.<br/>

where did the theory that Shingen was looking for sea access come<br/>
from?  I found that in a Japanese history book, but the actual source<br/>
was not listed.  Since Shinano was Shingen's only option for movement<br/>
because he was allied with the Imagawa and couldn't move soldiers<br/>
through Suruga, was he even trying to get to Echigo at all (he could<br/>
have been making moves to the West), or did his foray into Echigo<br/>
simply bring Kenshin down on him even though he hadn't intended to<br/>
even bother with Echigo?</div>

 </span></blockquote>Is it possibly related to the 'salt' episode? Perhaps simply an<br/>
extrapolation of an identified need by later historians that goes<br/>
"Takeda needed + Takeda was intelligent = Takeda must have wanted...",<br/>
regardless of the truth of the matter.<br/>
