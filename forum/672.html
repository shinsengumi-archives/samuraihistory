<div id="ygrps-yiv-1691694559">Hi there.  I am 17 and have always been fascinated by the samurai. I <br/>
am hoping that by joining this group I will learn alot. My  school <br/>
doesn't do anything with Japan at all. So know I am having to do <br/>
everything by myself. I hope you all can be a great source of <br/>
information and can answer my questions.<br/>
Peace</div>

<h3>Re: [Shogun total war</h3>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1952152952">I know that this game has been thoroughly talked about in this group, but I just wanted to know if anyone else has tried playing it whilst using The Art of War as a guide. You absolutely kick ass!<br/>
<br/>
I wonder what Sun Tzu would think if he knew that, 2500 years on HIS writings would help kids play video games? if he knew what a video game was.<br/>
<br/>
Also, on a completely different note, have any of you ever wondered that if Sun Tzu was japanese, and a Daimyo during the sengoku period, would he have become Shogun? could he beat Nobunaga? or Iyasu (tokugawa)? <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-2026024635">Hi!!<br/>
<br/>
 First, i have understood that the game follows the<br/>
precepts of Tzun Tzu�s "Art of War", since is supposed<br/>
that many of the daimyos of The Sengoku Period have<br/>
read it, i am not really sure, but the game follows<br/>
this way.<br/>
<br/>
 "The Art of War" is a great book, used today not just<br/>
for video game playing (It can be used as a guide in<br/>
other strategy games too), but also in commercial<br/>
bussines, in the day to day descisions (Try this one<br/>
sometime), and finally, as the best militar strategy<br/>
manual ever wroted.<br/>
<br/>
 If Tzun Tzu were japanese and a daimyo of the<br/>
Sengoku, period, Its quite possible that he could<br/>
become Shogun, but we will never know, don�t forget<br/>
that Tokugawa Ieyasu become Shogun as a result of many<br/>
different factors.<br/>
  <br/>

<h3>Re: [samuraihistory] Re: Shogun Total War</h3>
by <i>Olii Irsan</i>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-901079301">First of all, I'd like to say that Shogun isn't<br/>
just a game at all! I think of it as a 'time machine'<br/>
with which I can go to my favourite era in Japanese<br/>
history: The Sengoku Jiddai (The Era of Warring<br/>
States).<br/>
   I fell in love with it the first time I saw the<br/>
screen shots in a magazine and many tales of glorious<br/>
battles from a few of my fellow Daimyo at school. Too<br/>
bad you just can't simulate a battle as EPIC as the<br/>
Battle of Sekigahara or the Battle of Dan no Ura.<br/>
Although that would be cool...<br/>
   In reply to the comment on using Sun Tzu's Art of<br/>
War during the game, I agree that using the "Holy<br/>
Tome" is very useful. Note that in the modern day,<br/>
Chinese and Japanese businessmen has used the Art of<br/>
War for business strategy. Too bad you can't use it<br/>
for "conquering" your friends... ("Bow to me, slave!")<br/>
   Try using other books based on East Asian warfare,<br/>
espescially ones written by Dr. Stephen Turnbull.<br/>
   Oh, one final thing. If Sun Tzu was a Japanese<br/>
daimyo during the Sengoku Jiddai, the war would've<br/>
ended much sooner than we know it now. He'd probably<br/>
exploit the uses of Ninjas, Shinobi and Arquebuses<br/>
more than the other daimyo would!!<br/>
