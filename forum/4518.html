well before Nobunaga came on the scene.<br/>

And more than this, who is this "Yamato Emperor" ?<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Exactly. The world and Japan are two different entities, and thus the <br/>
contexts are indeed different.<br/>
Not to mention (again) that there were some 400 years of between <br/>
Nobunaga and Hitler, and that to start a war and to continue it is not <br/>
the same, like it is not the same to raze a few villages and to build <br/>
concentration camps for systematic extermination.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Sorry, I have NO IDEA of what are you trying to prove with these <br/>
citations above and the discourse on Tacitus etc. Actually, -again, I <br/>
apologize- I have no idea of what you are talking about. I thought the <br/>
discussion was about the utility or the futility to compare Nobunaga <br/>
and Hitler. Have I miss something?<br/>
