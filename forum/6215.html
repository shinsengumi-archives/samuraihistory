<h3>Japan purchases</h3>
by <i>thomas_tessera</i>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1029048171">I am just about to purchase 'Mibugishiden' from CD-Japan (probably) and am also trying to <br/>
get a copy of "Lives of the Master Swordsmen" from The East Publications.<br/>
<br/>
I've bought CDs from CD-Japan before, and get charged an additional tax by the Post  <br/>
Office here in the UK, which is somewhat annoying.<br/>
<br/>
Does anyone know of an alternative source for the DVD, or any source for the book? (The <br/>
East doesn't look like it's at home with online ordering.)<br/>
<br/>
If anyone in Japan wants to purchase and mail them to me, we can arrange money up <br/>
front. Not sure if this is a viable use of the forum, but I just thought I'd ask.<br/>

December 17th, and no doubt the DVD later.<br/>
<br/>
Did they read my post, d'you think?<br/>
