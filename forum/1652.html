<div id="ygrps-yiv-891802390">This can be a tricky question.  My initial thought was that it must be in <br/>
1868, during the Mejii restoration.<br/>
<br/>
But upon further reflection, it might have been during the 1877 Satsuma <br/>
Rebellion.  That was the last samurai rebellion.  Basically, you had samurai <br/>
on one side and Imperial troops on the other.  However, the Tokyo policemen <br/>
were brought in to fight with the Imperials and they were all samurai (or <br/>
former samurai).<br/>
<br/>
So it gets tricky depending on your definition of samurai.<br/>
<br/>
Perhaps someone else can shed more light on the subject for you.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>The "last" one depends on how you work the numbers.<br/>
<br/>
The samurai battle is usually considered to have been Shimabara in 1638. <br/>
Over 30,000 rônin and Christian samurai and peasants locked themselves <br/>
in Shimabara Castle, revolting against the brutality of the local lord. <br/>
The shogunate sent over 100,000  samurai in two waves to deal with them, <br/>
and it took months to break down the defenses. In the end, 37,000 <br/>
defenders were killed.<br/>
<br/>
Some people don't count Shimabara, as it involved peasants fighting as <br/>
well, and the structure of the defenders was a bit nebulous.<br/>
<br/>
If one doesn't count Shimabara, the last samurai warfare is usually <br/>
considered the Osaka Winter and Summer campaigns of 1614-1615, when the <br/>
forces of Tokugawa Ieyasu (now the retired shôgun), laid two sieges to <br/>
Ôsaka Castle to bring down the remnants of the Toyotomi family.<br/>
<br/>
The really last battles, though, were in the brief Bôshin War of 1868, <br/>
which was the war of Imperial Restoration. It wasn't much of a war, but <br/>
it was fought between samurai houses supporting either the shogunate or <br/>
the Imperial government.<br/>

quickly. They made short work of the defenses.<br/>

<br/>
By the way, Takasugi Shinsaku was quite a high ranking Choushuu samurai and seems to have been very conscious of his own rank. It doesn't seem accurate to see him as a democratic figure. Like most of the Choushuu Meiji heroes, many of whom rose from being commanders of the shotai (samurai-farmer militia) he was a brilliant opportunist. Ito and Inoue were quite low-rank: Inoue's upbringing as described in Choushuu no Tenka was that of a farming-samurai family. Many samurai did not want to join the militia as the new methods of rifle drill and so on were considered too boring. Farmers on the other hand found this less boring than the hardship of their lives and possibly also saw it as a way to enter the samurai class. <br/>
<br/>
I'd be interested to know if any of the Meiji leaders were interested in western-style democratic ideas.</div>

 </span></blockquote>Great fights and great stories both, certainly bushi versus bushi but <br/>
how "Western" was the fighting? Tabaruzaka was lost once the rain <br/>
stopped and cannon fire was effectively directed upon the defenders. <br/>
I don't mean to be obtuse, simply my own teacher always argued the <br/>
true bushi died at Sekigahara.<br/>

that it was his use of men of all social status, employing western <br/>

 </span></blockquote>No, I didn't think you did, I was just following the idea that the Restoration battles, despite mixed forces and modern weapons, were essentially samurai on samurai and therefore could be called the "last samurai battle."<br/>
<br/>
Despite all that, your teacher is probably right and we should go back to Sekigahara!(if whoever asked the question is still reading)<br/>

 </span></blockquote>	I was afraid you would ask this. I am convinced I read or was <br/>
told that Rousseau was an influence on Ryoma. However in checking my <br/>
references I can only find that Nakae Chomin was a student of French <br/>
in Nagasaki at the same time Ryoma was there. At the time Nakae was <br/>
studying under Tosa sponsorship. He is famous for his liberal <br/>
politics in the Meiji period and his translations of French Code of <br/>
Law and "The Social Contract". Clearly the democratic ideal inspired <br/>
him, but how early?  Thus there was likely no Japanese translation <br/>
available to Ryoma and he certainly didn't read it in the original <br/>
language. I will keep looking but may have shot down my own theory...<br/>
	I believe he would have been a positive influence on the new <br/>
age. I imagine him growing fat and corrupt at the head of a <br/>
Mitsubishi type shipping concern and his own political party or <br/>
perhaps leading elements of the new navy against the forces of Okubo <br/>
in concert with Saigo and the forces of Satsuma or maybe staking a <br/>
claim as a world famous rogue after circumnavigating the globe with <br/>
frequent stops in the capitols and parlors of the worlds great <br/>
Nations.<br/>
