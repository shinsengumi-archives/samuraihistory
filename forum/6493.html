Boston's MFA<br/>
By Chris Bergeron / News Staff Writer<br/>
Thursday, January 6, 2005<br/>
<br/>
With their fierce eyes and cruel talons, falcons seemed perfect <br/>
symbols for Japanese samurai. <br/>
 <br/>
     As wild birds of prey or trained hunters, their lethal beauty <br/>
touched a deep chord in warriors whose bushido code valued courage <br/>
and loyalty as the supreme virtues. <br/>
 <br/>
     The ancient sport of falconry provides a gorgeous window into <br/>
the art of the Edo period of Japan (1615-1868) in an informative <br/>
exhibit at the Museum of Fine Arts in Boston. <br/>
 <br/>
     Through majestic folding screens, lovely scrolls and delicate <br/>
ink paintings, "Pursuits of Power: Falconry and the Samurai, 1600-<br/>
1900) uses a seemingly obscure subject to bring three centuries of <br/>
Japanese history into vivid life. <br/>
 <br/>
     It also includes four armor suits, decorative stirrups, <br/>
woodblock prints and rare manuscripts. <br/>
 <br/>
     Anne Nishimura Morse, MFA curator of Japanese Art, said the <br/>
exhibit should equally satisfy aficionados of Asian art and anyone <br/>
who appreciates rare works of beauty. <br/>
 <br/>
     Visitors who cannot tell a goshawk from a falcon or Tom <br/>
Cruise's "Last Samurai" from Toshiro Mifune's "Yojimbo" will find <br/>
art that strikes the eye and stirs the soul. <br/>
 <br/>
     "I think there's so much interest in America today about the <br/>
culture of the samurai," she said. "This exhibit offers insights <br/>
into a segment of Japanese society that used falconry in a very <br/>
controlled way to assert its role to the public." <br/>
 <br/>
     As organized by Rachel Saunders of the MFA's Department of <br/>
Asian, Oceanic and Asian Art, the exhibit complements an ongoing <br/>
exhibit, "Lethal Elegance: The Art of Samurai Sword Fittings" <br/>
curated by Joe Earle. <br/>
 <br/>
     Taking swords and falconry as starting points, the companion <br/>
shows explore intriguing connections between Japanese martial <br/>
culture and aesthetic traditions. <br/>
 <br/>
     While Western films romanticize samurai as fatalistic <br/>
swordsmen, the Japanese equivalent of Wild West gunslingers, the two <br/>
shows use lovely art to chronicle their changing role in society. <br/>
 <br/>
     The exhibit raises interesting questions about how men of power <br/>
in all countries manipulate symbols of authority. <br/>
 <br/>
     A woodblock print of a famous warrior receiving a gift painting <br/>
of an eagle conveys the prosaic realities of court life. In an <br/>
amusing scroll, a 17th century samurai impresses passing women by <br/>
showing off the hawk perched on his sleeve while Mount Fuji towers <br/>
in the background. <br/>
 <br/>
     Three centuries later, presidential candidates posture as <br/>
regular guys by duck hunting or attending NASCAR. <br/>
 <br/>
     The exhibit's several large folding screens on the subject of <br/>
falconry combine revelatory beauty with subtle social observation. <br/>
 <br/>
     The samurai's powerful identification with the solitary hunters <br/>
becomes obvious. <br/>
 <br/>
     In a 17th century six-panel folding screen, "Hawk Eagle in a <br/>
Pine Tree," the winged subject's glinting eye and curved beak, <br/>
captured in remarkable detail with ink on paper, stare down on <br/>
viewers, conveying an impression of unquestionable authority. <br/>
 <br/>
     "Samurai used falconry as a way to reinforce their position as <br/>
the dominant political force," Morse said. <br/>
 <br/>
     One can only wonder whether ordinary citizens regarded samurai, <br/>
like the winged hunters they admired, as merciless exemplars of <br/>
natural law. Rather than focus exclusively on falcons, the exhibit <br/>
includes art featuring eagles, goshawks and other hunting birds to <br/>
examine the changing roles samurai played in Japanese society. <br/>
 <br/>
     The word "samurai" means "those who serve" and originally <br/>
referred to a military caste that adhered to a strict code of <br/>
loyalty, courage and cultivation of traditional arts. <br/>
 <br/>
     Starting around the 12th century, samurai served large <br/>
landowners called daimyos. After the feudal system was abolished in <br/>
1869 and Japan was united under a military leader or shogun, samurai <br/>
were reduced to ceremonial roles as reminders of a heroic past. <br/>
 <br/>
     The samurai's changing role from fighters to highly regarded <br/>
civil servants can be seen through the evolution of their body armor <br/>
from purely functional equipment to largely ceremonial suits. <br/>
 <br/>
     Once samurai had no more wars to fight, Morse said, they used <br/>
rituals and art associated with falconry to cultivate an image of <br/>
refined strength. <br/>
 <br/>
     As war became a thing of the past, Morse said extended falcon <br/>
hunts became both "outlets" for martial energy and ceremonies that <br/>
confirmed loyalty and status. <br/>
 <br/>
     A finely wrought fan is decorated with a scene of a royal hunt <br/>
from the classic novel "The Tale of the Genji" by Lady Murasaki. A <br/>
fabulously detailed horizontal painting, "Horse Racing at Kato <br/>
Shrine," depicts several levels of Japanese life with the subdued <br/>
complexity reminiscent of Flemish master Pieter Bruegel. <br/>
 <br/>
     The exhibit reveals Japan's ability to absorb and refine <br/>
activities and art borrowed from Asian neighbors. <br/>
 <br/>
     According to the informative wall , falconry came to Japan from <br/>
Korea in the sixth century. Chinese scroll painting was adapted by <br/>
Japanese artists who changed the proportions to suit homes where <br/>
people sat on floor mats rather than chairs. <br/>
 <br/>
     Morse observed both exhibits record the samurai's changing <br/>
world in times of relative peace when they used valued objects like <br/>
swords and hunting birds to assert the status their forebears earned <br/>
during the brutal civil wars of the past. <br/>
 <br/>
     After social reforms restricted falconry to the imperial family <br/>
in the late 19th century, great hunting birds remained potent <br/>
symbols in new art forms. <br/>
 <br/>
     The exhibit includes a striking sculpted bronze eagle with a <br/>
silver patina given to the emperor in 1917. <br/>
 <br/>
     Over time, images of hunting birds that once adorned samurai <br/>
armor were used to decorate gowns worn by merchants and courtesans. <br/>
 <br/>
     At its best, "Pursuits of Power" provides aesthetic thrills and <br/>
historical insights. <br/>
 <br/>
     The gold-dappled, six-panel folding screen "Goshawk Mews" <br/>
reveals the splendor of imperial Japan. At the height of the Edo <br/>
period, a yellow-eyed hawk soars down upon a raccoon. In a charming <br/>
19th century woodblock print, a child cries when his hawk-shaped <br/>
kite becomes entangled in a tree. <br/>
 <br/>
     One of Japan's greatest warriors, Tokugawa Ieyasu, said "a true <br/>
samurai must do more than act courageously in the heat of the <br/>
moment. The Way of the Warrior is fully achieved in times of peace <br/>
as well as times of conflict." <br/>
 <br/>
     This exhibit offers informed glimpses into both worlds. <br/>
 <br/>
     The Essentials: <br/>
 <br/>
     The exhibit "Pursuits of Power" is on view through June <br/>
