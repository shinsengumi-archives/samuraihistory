================================<br/>
The knowing is not the thoughts<br/>
The knowing is not the feelings<br/>
The knowing is not the body<br/>
The knowing is not the mind<br/>
<br/>
The knowing is found beyond the thoughts<br/>
The knowing is found without the feelings<br/>
The knowing continues when the body does not<br/>
The knowing trancends the mind<br/>
<br/>
The knowing is found within<br/>
The knowing is sometimes forgotten<br/>
The knowing is never gone<br/>
The knowing is for you to find<br/>
<br/>
The knowing is who you are<br/>
The knowing is where you have been<br/>
The knowing is where you are going<br/>
The knowing is knowing you know<br/>
