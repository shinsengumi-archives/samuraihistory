this topic drove me out of the shadows :)<br/>
<br/>
Japan was an extremely rich country. Its many feudal<br/>
lords could field armies greater in size than most<br/>
great European powers of the time could. Also, the<br/>
various religious sects had great influence and<br/>
strength, which could rival those all-too powerful<br/>
daimyos. It was importing advanced, and therefore<br/>
expensive, weaponry (matchlocks, cannons, breast-plate<br/>
armour) all the way from Europe. Its lords were<br/>
financing the construction of massive strongholds and<br/>
fortifications.<br/>
<br/>
My opinion is that Togukawa Ieyashu chose to counter<br/>
this by making everyone poor. He confiscated and took<br/>
under direct (appointing daikan) or indirect (through<br/>
the hatamoto families) bakufu control the most<br/>
strategically and economically important lands, he<br/>
overtaxed the rest of the daimyo, and he came up with<br/>
an ingenious hostage system, which also strained<br/>
greatly the finances of the daimyo. They had to<br/>
maintain two residences (double expenses), travel to<br/>
and from Edo according to a very strict and luxurious<br/>
protocol, etc. Plus they had two counselors (Edo- and<br/>
Kano-Karo), which were usually the actual rulers of<br/>
their particular domain (Edo estate or Han), and often<br/>
conspired against each other.<br/>
<br/>
In order to cope with the above, the daimyo had in<br/>
turn to overtax their serfs. So the economically<br/>
strangled daimyo were in turn doing the same to their<br/>
populations, thus doing the job of the bakufu<br/>
themselves.<br/>
<br/>
Also, another important factor might have been the way<br/>
the bakufu was able to benefit financially from the<br/>
pricing of rice. It was paying its retainers in rice,<br/>
the rice merchants bought that cheap, and later on<br/>
sold it expensive, paying adequate taxes to the<br/>
bakufu, while at the same time samurai, peasants, and<br/>
even jikisan retainers were strugling with poverty.<br/>
<br/>
As it's been pointed out before "It's the economy,<br/>
stupid!"<br/>
