<h3>The &quot;I am a Samurai !!&quot; chaps</h3>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1048699607">No, I am not, don't worry!<br/>
But looks like there are a lot of them around... If you look at the <br/>
board about 'the Last Samurai' in www.imdb.com, there is a big <br/>
discussion going on, with at least 5 people calling themselves <br/>
"samurai" (for various reasons), and a lot more mocking them.<br/>
Now, I have lived in Kyoto for 6 years (and I will be back in a few <br/>
years), and I am personally quite annoyed by the "I-am-a-samurai" guys <br/>
(or "I-am-a-Zen-monk," etc.), especially gaijins. And believe me, there <br/>
are a lot of them in Japan. And after Tom Cruise's movie, expect <br/>
more...<br/>
However, my opinion is that everybody is entitled to his/her own <br/>
fantasies. As far as these "samurai" do not go around cutting people <br/>
for real, I believe we should tolerate them. We all have our own <br/>
dreams, and we hate others shattering them, don't we?<br/>
The only alternative would be to be "NORMAL." Now, there we would <br/>
really have a problem...<br/>
Bye!<br/>
