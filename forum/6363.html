"Ryu Hayabusa <br/>
<br/>
Background: Ryu's past is shrouded in secrecy. It is<br/>
known that he attended the last surviving school of<br/>
ninjitsu near Mt. Fuji in Japan but was expelled for<br/>
"inappropriate behavior." It is assumed that this<br/>
dishonor may have caused him to lose connection with<br/>
humanity, but this is mostly an inference drawn from<br/>
the 20-30 ninja corpses he left littered throughout<br/>
Japan. He joined BlackMarketBabies.com in order to pay<br/>
off his credit card debt. <br/>
Favorite Requisition Tactic: Ninja swiftness. <br/>
Goal in Life: Death. "<br/>

(If you can't tell this is a satirical website, you<br/>
probably need to be sterilized. But then, you'd just<br/>
be trying to get babies through the website, wouldn't<br/>
you? So I'll spell it out: IT'S A JOKE!)<br/>
