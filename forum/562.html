<h3>Question about secondary sources</h3>
by <i>todd666ca</i>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-785439109">Hi, Folks.<br/>
<br/>
I'm looking for some scholarly opinion on the secondary source, "Secrets of <br/>
the Samurai" by Ratti and Westbrook.  A google search brought to my <br/>
attention lots of positive reviews and mentions from bookstores and people <br/>
who seem to be students of various martial arts, but not from any source I <br/>
would consider authoritative on the subject of Japanese cultural history; I <br/>
could find no academic reviews.  While the book has a fairly large <br/>
bibliography as I recall, and does mention, I think, something called the <br/>
Historia Nipponica in the credits, I don't remember seeing any footnotes, <br/>
page references to other sources, or endnotes; this lack set off a warning <br/>
bell.<br/>
<br/>
So, does anyone here know anything about how well received this work is by <br/>
historians and scholars?<br/>
<br/>
Thanks for any advice.<br/>
<br/>
Todd<br/>
<br/>

   I've read a lot of Turnbull, and he's a good popular author, but <br/>
he's writing for a popular audience, and not for scholars. I picked up <br/>
his books when I was a medeival recreationist (For a decade I made <br/>
Japanese armor for sale to other recreationists). I think it depends <br/>
on who you're teaching-- when I was working on my Bachelor's degree <br/>
in Asian Studies, the professor cited some of Turnbull's writings, to <br/>
give us a feel for particular aspects of Japanese culture. When I did <br/>
my Masters in Japanese history, my advisor, Dr Paul Varley, knew of <br/>
Turnbull but never had reason to cite him (nor did the other Japanese <br/>
history faculty at my school). <br/>
   By all means read Turnbull for background, then move on to deeper <br/>
scholarship in particular topics. I respect him as a very influential <br/>
popularizer of Japanese history, but don't normally think of him as a <br/>
historian, since the books I have from him aren't written in <br/>
historian style (lacking footnotes...). Of course, I haven't written <br/>
anything that got published either, and he has done plenty. Like I <br/>
said, he's well worth reading to get started, or to fill in on topics <br/>
you don't know well.<br/>
