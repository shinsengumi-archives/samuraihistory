<div id="ygrps-yiv-1235990306">If the assassin in your son's story is using shuriken to assassinate <br/>
his victims, he most likely wouldn't use poison. The rust of the blades <br/>
in that time period would be enough to kill a victim. If he's using a <br/>
blow gun or something along those lines, my guess is that the poison <br/>
would be made from some sort of plants. Blowfish poison might be a good <br/>
guess, but I'm not so sure. Hope this helps.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1265745118">I am sure your paper has been written by now,<br/>
but I wouldn't forget lead which was common and a good slow death,<br/>
arsenic which was made into little balls and left in the corners of<br/>
your rooms for mice and rats to nibble on and Japan had a variety of<br/>
poison mushrooms available as well.<br/>
as far as the honor thing goes the Japanese were not above poisoning<br/>
people even in the highest positions, I might say especially in the<br/>
highest positions. A number of emperors were suspected of being<br/>
poisoned. So much so that his diet became highly ritualized with<br/>
careful checks by others before he could partake. The was true for the<br/>
Tokugawa shoguns whose diet was very restricted, avoiding extremes of<br/>
temperature, and indgredient. Mostly bland soups with only the<br/>
occasional treat at times of ritual celebration. (Sometimes it is not<br/>
so good to be at the top...)<br/>
Oiwa-san of the Yotsuya Kaidan was given some really nasty poison that<br/>
not only took her life but twisted and disfugured her before doing so.<br/>
You might look that up.<br/>
My favorite is the story from the Date Sôdô, wherein the faithful<br/>
page-boy steals and eats the poison mochi meant for his young lord.<br/>
His mother who was wet nurse to the child Daimyo must sit motionless<br/>
as her son is executed for his rude action even as he writhes about in<br/>
pain from the poison.<br/>
