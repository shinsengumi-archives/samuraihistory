<h3>Thoughts on Musashi</h3>
by <i>thomas_tessera</i>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1520415744">As one initially interested in the swordsman, and from them the <br/>
samurai, I have to say I treat Musashi as something of a 'bubble' <br/>
character. He could belong to any era, and in his person and conduct <br/>
could hardly be considered an exemplar of samurai virtue. <br/>
<br/>
His legacy as a samurai is zero, and as a swordsman rests almost <br/>
entirely on The Book of Five Rings - he had no remarkable 'heritage' <br/>
in swordsmanship, and his Niten Ichi Ryu techniques were absorbed <br/>
into other, more prominent ryu, without making any significant impact <br/>
upon them. He was an oddball, one might say 'a natural born killer.'<br/>
<br/>
Historically, there are (in my book) far more interesting characters, <br/>
who made an equally, if not greater, impact on the art of <br/>
swordsmanship, and also took their place on the stage of history, a <br/>
few of them major players in the events of their day.<br/>
<br/>
Bokuden, for example, out-stripped Mushashi in martial <br/>
accomplishment, and most of his individual victories were on the <br/>
battlefield, which I reckon are harder fought and harder earned (and <br/>
Mushashi used every trick in the book to unsettle his opponents.)<br/>
<br/>
Nobutsuna learned from Bokuden and fought Takeda Shingen, from whom <br/>
he received his name Kamizumi, and was the 'real deal' upon which <br/>
Kurosawa modelled the scene in which Kanbei, leader of the 7 Samurai, <br/>
rescued a child from a bandit, and who was praised as living <br/>
the 'essence of Zen' in surrendering to attain victory.<br/>
<br/>
Yagyu Munenori (hope I'm getting all these names right) studied under <br/>
Nobutsuna and was an instructor to and possibly an 'agent of <br/>
influence' (real shinobi stuff here) of Tokugawa Ieyasu. At the Siege <br/>
of Osaka when Ieyasu and his son were ambushed, Munenori attacked <br/>
single-handed and took out seven men in full armour before Ieyasu's <br/>
escort had even recovered. This stands as one of the most outstanding <br/>
acts of swordsmanship authentically witnessed and recorded for <br/>
posterity.<br/>
<br/>
The Tosa Swordsmen of what is now the Muso Shinden and Eishinkan Ryu <br/>
were some of the most active during the Meiji Restoration, Ryoma <br/>
Sakamoto among them. Another notable, Master Swordsman Tesshu, <br/>
founded the Muto Ryu on Bokuden's lineage, plus also the Itto Ryu. <br/>
His Edo Dojo was always packed with hardcore swordsmen, little <br/>
knowing that Tesshu's intention was to tire them out in training so <br/>
that they wouldn't go out and make trouble. He also acted as <br/>
intermediary between the Emperor and the Shogunate, with quite <br/>
remarkable effect. He was also a Zen aesthete and a notable <br/>
calligrapher and artist.<br/>
<br/>
These are just a few of the men who proved and perfected the art of <br/>
swordsmanship, and who took their stand in the affairs of the day and <br/>
made their mark on history. Some, in some small way, might have <br/>
actually altered its course.<br/>
<br/>
Mushashi's contribution should be measured against their <br/>
achievements, and in so doing I view him as a big man, standing among <br/>
giants.<br/>
