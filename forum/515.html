<h3>Scott?s books</h3>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-614254118">Personally I cannot recommend Hagakure as a good<br/>
historical peace for early Japan, it?s an Edo book<br/>
expressing values that where not really embraced until<br/>
still later. My suggestion to Scott would be to attack<br/>
the subject one topic at a time, for example if you<br/>
want to start with military history then you can pick<br/>
up one of Osprey?s men at arms books. Good primers,<br/>
which is what it sounds like you are interested in.<br/>
The book that got me into the military history of<br/>
Japan is ?Arms and Armor of the Samurai?. <br/>
If, however you just want a general overview of the<br/>
entire history of Japan then ?Japan, its history and<br/>
culture,? by W. Scott Morton is reasonable.    <br/>
