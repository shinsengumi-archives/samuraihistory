<h3>More on Hojo Soun and Izu province</h3>
by <i>kitsuno</i>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-838304476">I have been noticing that the dates for Hojo Soun's invasion of Izu <br/>
province is placed at either 1491 or 1493.  1491 makes sense because <br/>
that was the year of Chachamaru's violent grab for power and the <br/>
start of a civil war.  But 1493 makes sense too because it was the <br/>
year that Jundouji's (the younger brother killed by Chachamaru) older <br/>
brother Ashikaga Yoshizumi took control as Shogun, and that would <br/>
have given Soun the 'justification' for invasion - to avenge the <br/>
mother and brother of the Shogun.  Not to mention 2 years of civil <br/>
war in Izu would take a toll on everyone involved, given Soun an <br/>
easier time of it all.<br/>
<br/>
So which is it, 1491 or 1493?</div>
