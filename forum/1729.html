<h3>What Happened?</h3>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-943445461">I just wanted to post this - for some reason Yahoo Groups had me <br/>
turned off from receiving e-mails for a few days. They sent me an <br/>
e-mail which I replied to and it is supposed to be fixed. So, I did <br/>
not receive by e-mail any of the postings from May 7 thru May 9. I <br/>
will go thru those postings now and respond if it is appropriate and <br/>
I apologize if anyone was waiting for a response.<br/>
