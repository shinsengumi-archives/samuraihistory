<h3>Help with samurai armor</h3>
by <i>flytrapsa</i>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1471847069">I was wondering if anybody can help me. I am a researcher in South Africa working in a museum. I have a samurai suite that I will be putting on exhibition soon. I was wondering if one is able to date the armor just by looking at it and is one able to say who it might have belonged to? It also has a katana with an inscription on the hilt, could someone translate it for me, if possible?<br/>

Thank you kindly<br/>

 <br/>
I can certainly date the armour for you, and I can get plenty of help from japanese weapons experts on translating the inscription on the tang of the katana or tachi. Please send some digital photgraphs to start the ball rolling.<br/>
 <br/>
Best regards<br/>

  If you post pics I'll do what I can. If it was made with mon on the kanamono I can give a reasonable guess on which clan. As for the katana, I can't help much. There are others here who could probably help if you posted pics.<br/>

	If you are a Yahoo member you can post photos to the photo albums  <br/>
associated with this group. Why not let all of us have a crack at  <br/>
that Katana mei and a good look at the armour. We are all sure to  <br/>
learn something from the discussion.<br/>
