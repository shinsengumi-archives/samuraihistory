<div id="ygrps-yiv-1907291151">I heard of the name and I read the biography of<br/>
Sakamoto Ryoma, I would suggest you check the book out<br/>
because it will answer both your questions. Besides,<br/>
I'm still learning about the Shinsen-gumi, I somehow I<br/>
knew Okita Soji was the captain of the First squad.<br/>

HI!<br/>
<br/>
Shinsengumi were a sort of police setted during bakumatsu jidai to protect Kyoto from the actions of shishis. They were also called WOLVES OF MIBU, because of their belongings to that place.<br/>
<br/>
They were organised in SQUAD (I'm not sure if this is the rel translation from japanese...i'm italian sorry!), and Souji Okita was the captain of the first one.<br/>
