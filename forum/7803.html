<h3>Warrior Monks?</h3>
by <i>zeninmansfield</i>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1830144670">I have a question about the existence of so called "Warrior Monks". <br/>
Did they really exist? Were they just ordained lay Buddhists? I have <br/>
seen several pictures of samurai wearing rakusu (a bib like garment <br/>
worn around the neck and across the chest with a small ring on one <br/>
side) denoting being an ordained lay Buddhist. How did they get past <br/>
the Buddhist precept of not killing? Are there any stories or books on <br/>
this subject? <br/>

<br/>
Perhaps those monks you see, are retired samurai.  <br/>
Usually, when a samurai retired himself from active<br/>
service previusly autorized by his daymio, he usually<br/>
decide to ordaine himself as a monk.  This was done in<br/>
order to clean his mind and spirit from all the deaths<br/>
and suffer he provide in his service life.<br/>
And some other samurai follow this road in order to<br/>
explore a religios path.<br/>
<br/>
Best regards. <br/>
