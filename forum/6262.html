<div id="ygrps-yiv-1424060776">Amusingly, I didn't think Cruise did too badly in that bomb, although I have<br/>
never come close to liking him before.  It's not that it was great drama,<br/>
but when he told his recruiter that he'd gladly kill him for free, I<br/>
believed him - and I'd never believed Cruise delivering a single line before<br/>
that.  But I hope I don't start a dialogue with that, as it's a throwaway<br/>
note.   I flatly refuse to be put in the position of defending Tom Cruise.<br/>
Historically... aside from the colours of the grasses and skies that someone<br/>
else mentioned, I think the first street scene in Japan was beautiful, and<br/>
as far as I could tell it was pretty accurate.  Somebody seemed to have gone<br/>
to considerable trouble to establish that nicely juxtaposed set of images.<br/>
I remain vastly amused, however, at the prospect of a foreign national who<br/>
has fought in a losing rebellion being permitted to carry a sword into the<br/>
Emperor's presence.  Sure, no problem, gaijin-san, go right  in.<br/>

   I just got done finally watching the movie the "Last Samurai." I<br/>
found it so tediously dull it isn't funny; Tom Cruz cannot act and I<br/>
don't care who tries to convince me otherwise. The battle scenes were<br/>
great, the scenery was fairly good, but the movie was bad. My<br/>
question is a simple one, what, if any of it, was historically<br/>
accurate?<br/>
