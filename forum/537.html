<h3>Samurai warfare</h3>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1017800775">Hello all,<br/>
<br/>
I'm wargamer, new to this group and to Samurai history in general. My <br/>
interest in Samurai armies is quite recent and I've managed to obtain <br/>
some books from Osprey Publishing (haven't arrived yet). From what <br/>
I've seen the bibliography is very extensive and it's driving me nuts <br/>
just to know were to start. Please, I want your suggestions on just <br/>
the top 5 books on Samurai warfare, arms and armour, it would realy <br/>
help.<br/>
<br/>
By the way, does enyone know if the Portuguese ever employed <br/>
christian Samurai mercenaries in the Far East?<br/>
<br/>
Thanx,<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
Saludos a Portugal!<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
The most accessible books on the introduction to Samurai culture are <br/>
as follows:<br/>
<br/>
"SAMURAI WARFARE" by Turnbull<br/>
"THE SAMURAI SOURCEBOOK" by Turnbull<br/>
"SAMURAI 1550-1600" by Bryant   (Osprey Warrior series)<br/>
"SEKIGAHARA 1600" by Bryant (Osprey Campaign series)<br/>
"NAGASHINO 1575" by Turnbull  (Osprey Campaign series)<br/>
<br/>
Unfortunately, I have yet to find a book which deals with correct <br/>
orders of battle, precise use of Sashimono by units and so on. This <br/>
is very frustrating for the wargamer, much more than painting the <br/>
lacing on armour! Hey Nuno, have you seen the Perry's new figures?<br/>
<br/>
Regards,<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Joe<br/>
<br/>
PS I have not heard of the use of Christian Samurai by the <br/>
Portuguese, Mendes Pinto's initial influence on Samurai warfare is <br/>
the only Samurai-Portuguese military connection I know of, which of <br/>
course does not mean there were not others!<br/>

<br/>
Thanks for the list. The Osprey books were my first choice and am <br/>
lookink forward to read Turnbull's "Samurai Warfare". I haven't seen <br/>
the Perry's Samurai but asked them to send me a couple of samples. <br/>
I'll let you know as soon as they arrive.<br/>
<br/>
Até à próxima,<br/>
