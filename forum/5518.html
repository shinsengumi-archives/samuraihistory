They were mostly tall and rectangular in shape big enough for a man to hide behind<br/>
i am not sure if foot soldiers ever carried a smaller one<br/>

<h3>Re: [samuraihistory] Samurai armor</h3>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-80295230">In addition to the previous post on this topic, samurai weapons were primarily two-<br/>
handed - the bow and the spear (the sword was not a principle battlefield weapon).<br/>
<br/>
The development of armour is tied in with the development of weapons which is tied <br/>
in with the development of technique, which has to cope with the developments in <br/>
armour (so there's a kind of evolutionary cycle going on) so as the samurai invariably <br/>
needed both hands to handle his weapons, shields did not figure, although I have <br/>
always thought the 'sode' - shoulderguards - served in this capacity somewhat <br/>
(armourers on the board might correct me here).<br/>
<br/>
The swordsmanship of the Katori Shinto Ryu traces its roots from the battlefield, and <br/>
requires two hands to deliver accurate and effective strikes against a person in <br/>
armour, targetting the 'soft spots' or necessary 'gaps' to allow mobility, eg. neck and <br/>
the inner side of the limbs.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1360331726">One of the "Strategic Weapons" TV series featured the Japanese sword.  I<br/>
think I recall an observation in the program that said the sword could also<br/>
be thought of as a shield because of its defensive capability to deflect<br/>
blows.  Of course, is this making a virtue of a necessity as the sword<br/>
requires two hands to be used effectively, as Thomas notes?  The program is<br/>
worth seeking out if you haven't seen it.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1603503348">Hi Barry - <br/>
<br/>
I missed that program!<br/>
<br/>
Just a quick note - there are defensive techniques (parries) learned as well as <br/>
offensive cuts. One of the things I've only recently learnt is that whilst the sword is <br/>
lethally (and almost mythically) strong in the cut, it is prey to lateral pressures and can <br/>
often bend in the clash of blade on blade.<br/>
<br/>
So when you see Hollywood swordplay with blades hitting each other almost at right <br/>
angles, it's unlikely the owner would ever be able to get the sword back in the saya.<br/>
<br/>
If you ever get a chance to see 'Gohatto' there are three fencing session with bokken <br/>
at the very start. If you listen to the sound of bokken on bokken, the main character's <br/>
swordplay is a lot more subtle, the angle of deflection is a lot less (more acute) and <br/>
the 'clash' sound is noticably softer - his sword would survive the encounter whereas <br/>
the others might bend their blades.<br/>
<br/>
In kenjutsu the technique is to 'catch and deflect' - to slide the incoming blade along <br/>
your own, rather than clash and stop it.<br/>
<br/>
Lastly, if you look at the poster for the film 'Blade' the hero is employing a classic <br/>
deflection for an overhead blow, however as his left shoulder is visible beyond his <br/>
blade, the deflected blow would have taken his arm off!<br/>
<br/>
Hopefully the blade experts online will add or correct my assumptions.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-2140490071">Practice with mediaeval longswords based on  fencing manuals gives similiar output- hard blocking is a bane of ANY sword- no matter how well done and how thick so first thing fencing practicioners learn  is how to block propertly. Apart from all other factors huge price of the sword (I presume there is some kind of similiarity between Europe and Japan in this matter) did not allowed freedom of sacrificing one sword per each combat and that's most likely output of hard blocking.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-187540502">I have read some interesting articles about turtle shells being used <br/>
as a shield in Japanese antiquity.  But from what I gathered from the <br/>
literature the practice was a inherited from Korea and or China and <br/>
was all but forgotten by the rise samurai class.   Other then that <br/>
the only shield I have seen was an over sized round disk in place of <br/>
the  kekko on the left  kote that was about the size of a small <br/>
buckler that could be used as a shield.   But my guess is it was a <br/>
one of a kind piece and not at all common.   <br/>
