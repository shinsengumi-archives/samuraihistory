<h3>Ishida Mitsunari</h3>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1496188766">Greetings:<br/>
<br/>
This is my first post to this forum, so let me begin this with a <br/>
hello.<br/>
I've been looking for some good infromation about the life of Ishida <br/>
Mitsunari. I didn't found much in the Samurai Archives, nor in other <br/>
pages in google.<br/>
Could someone share with me information, or sources of that (pages), <br/>
about this man? I mean, not only that was the one that lead the <br/>
western army at Sekigahara. I mean, about his family, about his <br/>
career, love, battles, intrigue, etc.<br/>
Thanks in advance.<br/>
<br/>
