<h3>Poor NobuNaga on Samurai Deeper Kyo</h3>
by <i>keiman0</i>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-177394334">I have just finished reading all about the great Oda Nobunaga of the <br/>
Toshogowa Clan (hope I spelt that correctly) and then I was watching <br/>
Samurai Deeper Kyo the other evening and wowie- The noble Nobunaga has <br/>
been cast as the main villain of the piece (Spoilers)<br/>
<br/>
He is supposedly a demon king who came to earth four years ago at the <br/>
Battle of Sekigahara (which I now know was in 1600) and is seeking his <br/>
body as is Kyo or Demon Eyes Kyo as they call him. Why? So he can be <br/>
resurrected as a terrible monster and take over Earth. <br/>
<br/>
I was saddened to see such a noble hero thus portrayed. More later <br/>
perhaps. Have a glorious day. Toodles-K&K</div>

Nagashino was a tactical brilliance that revolutionized warfare, but a<br/>
*lot* of folks didnt think it was to honorable.  Plus he was a little<br/>
taken with being eccentric and anything foreign.  Many saw him as the<br/>
downfall of society if he had ruled Japan.  <br/>

<h3>Re: Poor NobuNaga and Shinsengumi on Samurai Deeper Kyo</h3>

<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1323102485">--Bad enough that poor Nobunaga is cast as the villain. Now they are <br/>
using the Mibu Clan (the Shinsengumi) as the baddies too. They come <br/>
off after last night's eppy as being a cross twixt alchemists and <br/>
the 'True Knights' (the Knights Templar aka the Rosicrucians or <br/>
Knights of the Rosy Cross) of the Crusades. There are striking <br/>
similarities too. Both had a working knowledge of nature, both were <br/>
concerned with history, both used alchemy (what else is Kyo's body <br/>
but an alchemical wonder?), both were rumoured to possess secrets of <br/>
time travel, both were wealthy and both were persecuted by the higher-<br/>
ups. After all that is why Friday the 13th is unlucky. It's the day <br/>
the Pope hanged Sir Gilles de Mourignay the Templar Leader for <br/>
refusing to disclose the location of the Templar fortune. By the way, <br/>
the Templars founded the banking industry and created credit cards <br/>
too. One more thing- Mageria has the secret of seeing the future. Is <br/>
he also a Mibu Clansman? This explains how Yui (think I got it spelt <br/>
OK this time) or rather her brother came to possess a weapon not to <br/>
be invented for a few more centuries. Time travel? If I knew all this <br/>
stuff about SDK I would have added some of 'em to my ff. Well more <br/>
soon since tonight is the demonic castle at Sekigahara. A last note <br/>
here- Is it a coincidence that Kyoto (old capitol) and Tokyo (new <br/>
capitol) are anagrams of each other? See you soon. Kami bless. <br/>
