<br/>
Dear All-<br/>
	I am writing to you to tell you about a unique event. Esaka Seigen  <br/>
Sensei (Hanshi Ju-dan ) from Matsudo, Japan, will be<br/>
visiting the San Francisco bay area from 24 Aug 2009 to 1 Sep 2009.<br/>
In conjunction with the San Francisco Asian Art Museum <br/>
(www.asianart.org),  he will<br/>
lecture on and demonstrate Iaido, the traditional Japanese martial art<br/>
of drawing and cutting with the sword. He will also be teaching Iaido<br/>
classes as part of his visit. Participants of any experience level  <br/>
and from any style will be<br/>
welcome at the seminar, though space may be limited. If you or any of  <br/>
your students are<br/>
interested please let us know right away (<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="mailto:outreach@...">outreach@...</a>).  <br/>
Details of cost, location<br/>
and registration to follow.<br/>
<br/>
Thank you.<br/>
<br/>
Sensei Andrej Hendryk Diamantstein (Renshi 6th Dan Z.N.I.R.)<br/>
<br/>
Frankly this is a really exciting event,<br/>
	it will run in conjunction with the museum exhibit, "Lords of the  <br/>
Samurai", (<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.asianart.org/Samurai.htm)">http://www.asianart.org/Samurai.htm)</a>, a great excuse to  <br/>
come to San Francisco, study swords and study swordsmanship with one  <br/>
of the preeminent teachers now active in Japan. I am not sure members  <br/>
of your dojo will be interested but they are all welcome and I hope  <br/>
that you will share this with any teacher, student or group that you  <br/>
think will be interested. This looks to be a terrific exhibition and  <br/>
Esaka Sensei's instruction is always worthwhile. Hope we can see you  <br/>
there.<br/>
You friend in the way,<br/>
-t<br/>
