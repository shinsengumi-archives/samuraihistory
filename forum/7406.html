<h3>Help with weapon info</h3>
by <i>meta_ridley</i>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1035868666">I was woundering if anyone would be able to point me into the <br/>
direction of a website that has pictures and info on most fuedal era <br/>
weapons, I am big on martial arts weapons and I want a site that <br/>
carries as much info on them as I can find. I have been looking up <br/>
specific weapons but there are more about weapons I havent see yet <br/>
that I want to learn about. So any help would be greatly appreciated.</div>
