<div id="ygrps-yiv-1173892800">Takeda Katsuyori ascended to be daimyo of the powerful Takeda Clan  on the <br/>
death in battle of his father Takeda Shingen.  During his long feud with Uesugi <br/>
Kenshin,  Shingen had developed his clan's cavalry,  which benefited from <br/>
living adjacent to fine horse-breeding grounds,  into perhaps the best Asiatic <br/>
cavalry force seen since the Mongols of Genghiz Khan.  Also,  Shingen realized <br/>
the military revolution that was wrought by the introduction of firearms by the <br/>
Portuguese in 1543 at Tanegashima.  However,  this was a lesson fatally <br/>
ignored by Takeda Katsuyori at Nagashino in 1575.  There, he attacked the firearms <br/>
corps,  the Teppu Shu,  of Oda Nobunaga and his ally  Tokugawa Ieyasu, who were <br/>
waiting behind prepared positions.  The Takeda cavalry was smashed forever.  <br/>
In 1582,  Katsuyori committed  seppuku rather than be captured by Nobunaga and <br/>
 Ieyasu.   Professor Murphy<br/>
