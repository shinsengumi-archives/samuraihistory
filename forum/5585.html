<h3>Trip to Sengoku Japan?</h3>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-2003458933">I'm about to start planning (again) a 3-week trip to Japan.<br/>

I'm interested primarily in Tokugawa Ieyasu (pre-Edo), and Mikawa (as was) <br/>

'look n feel' than anything else, although I'm quite aware that Japan has <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1000872333">If you're interested in Tokugawa Ieyasu, a trip to Nikko would be well worth your time (I only hope the weather is better than I was there- torrential rainstorms are not uncommon there).  Only two hours by train from Tokyo, it houses Ieyasu's mausoleum, located in the forest above the very impressive Toshogu Shrine(which also houses a Kendo dojo where you can view training).  <br/>
If in Tokyo, a trip to Kamakura is a must.  Despite the electricity and telephone cables that dog any modern Japanese townscape, Kamakura can be a treat with its temples and shrines, at one which (the Engakuji) you can often see practitioners of Kyudo at work. <br/>
Then if you're going to Kyoto you could stop at Hamamatsu and see the site of Ieyasu's Shussejyo (although it is again a post-War reproduction. Hamamatsu is more of interest if you like Japanese motorbikes though I found.  <br/>
Have a good time. <br/>

original Toshogu, you'll see the place and manner that Ieyasu desired <br/>
to be buried. Go to Nikko as well but keep in mind that is where his <br/>
sons moved him so that he could be more easily venerated just a short <br/>
ride from Edo. The Sunpu Toshogu has a must see museum that houses many <br/>
of the treasures of the Tokugawa house. It is expensive but I recommend <br/>
the catalog of the Toshogu's Armour collection.<br/>
	You can visit the remains of Sunpu castle where I believe you can now <br/>
see a scale mock up of the castle and town in Ieyasu's time in an <br/>
outdoor park within the old castle walls. Also you'll find the <br/>
retirement mansion of Tokugawa Keiki, The last Shogun, who chose to <br/>
spend his last year's communing with the spirit of his great <br/>
ancestor...<br/>

A lifetime experience packed in one trip is visiting all the castles in Japan and other historical sites from the Sengoku period.Plus,nothing will be complete without a one day trip in a forest.To be alone with Mother Nature.<br/>

 <br/>
P.S.:That's my kind of a trip to another country.In my country,visiting all the monasteries and churches is wonderful(in the north of Romania,where our ancestors built wonderful monasteries.If someone from this group would like to visit ROmania,we've got lots of stuff here.Monasteries,tens of castles,beautiful paintings..........Go to the north especially.)<br/>
