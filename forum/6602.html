	Sometimes I wonder if my posts are getting thru. As Clive has said you <br/>
can't really learn to recognize quality by reading on the internet, and <br/>
you can learn some from books but really need to see quality to learn <br/>
to recognize it. I don't recommend studying junks or fakes either, <br/>
however one thing we can learn from the internet is how to recognize <br/>
some of the fakes and junk that is out there. Please see this link;<br/>

The source is of course the Japanese Sword index, which I am forever <br/>
referring to, see this link:<br/>
