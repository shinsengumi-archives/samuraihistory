<h3>Shinsen Gumi Uniform</h3>

<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-2102463169">I was wondering if anyone knows if a uniform for the Shinsen Gumi <br/>
existed, and what it looked like.  I have seen movies that conflict <br/>
with eachother, besides.. they are movies, not to be taken as <br/>
fact :D.  So I would like actual historical information as opposed to <br/>
observations from movies.</div>

	As I remember it they copied the coats of the Ako roshi as <br/>
they were considered the epitome of loyalty, they used white <br/>
"diamonds" on a blue background while the squad leaders used black <br/>
"diamonds" on natural hemp. I always thought it ironic because their <br/>
mission was to support the Tokugawa, while at the heart of the Ako <br/>
roshi's action was a decided Anti-Tokugawa bent.<br/>
	Someone asked about superlative samurai from the Tokugawa <br/>
period, you need look no further than the Ako roshi or "the 47 loyal <br/>
retainers".<br/>
