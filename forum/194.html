<h3>Introduction and question</h3>
by <i>R Kibatti</i>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-229761668">Hi, everybody,<br/>
<br/>
I have been a silent member of your group reading discussions with great <br/>
interest for several months now.  My name is Tim and I have been studying <br/>
Japanese history for about six years now and take the strongest interest in <br/>
the history of feudal Japan.<br/>
<br/>
Now the question: I watched a Kurosawa movie "Kagemusha" and then read that <br/>
the among the scenes, where various warlords discuss whether Takeda died or <br/>
not (and of course then, when they learn that he indeed died) there are Oda <br/>
and Tokugawa.  I heard or read somewhere that in the version of this movie <br/>
shown on the national Japanese TV broadcast, there was also Uesugi.  There <br/>
also of course a legend about weeping Uesugi regretting the loss of the <br/>
greatest enemy.  Why was this scene cut out of the version which went on <br/>
international sale/rent?<br/>
<br/>
Thanks<br/>
<br/>
Tim<br/>

<br/>
The scenes were cut for one reason: Nobunaga and Ieyasu had scenes together,<br/>
so they had a sense of subplot. Uesugi didn't have scenes with the others, and<br/>
the people who brought it over for us (Fox) felt that *three* enemies would be<br/>
too difficult to remember or keep track of.<br/>
<br/>
That plus the fact that Uesugi was well known in Japan as Shingen's great<br/>
historic rival, but for this story he was a side character and totally<br/>
unnecessary. The Japanese audience would know who he was when they saw him and<br/>
would know back story. We wouldn't, so why confuse the issue? It's like a<br/>
movie in the US throwing in a reference to "Babe the Blue Ox" -- we'd know<br/>
that means that Paul Bunyon was involved somehow, but people in Japan wouldn't<br/>
know about that because that's not part of their national<br/>
culture/history/identity. Rather than try to figure out how to explain it, if<br/>
it didn't matter, they'd just cut it.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1505136932">In a TV Drama I saw called "Takeda Shingen" from the eighties, Kenshin <br/>
actually performed a Waka accompanied by a dance. Kenshin is a devoter of <br/>
the Hindu God Vishnu, whom he titled "War God of the North".<br/>
