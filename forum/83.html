<h3>NHK Taiga Drama</h3>
by <i>Christopher West</i>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1450478455">Since quite a few people on the list have apparently seen a few Taiga <br/>
drama, let's throw out a poll:  What is your favorite Taiga drama, <br/>
and more importantly, why?<br/>
<br/>
I'll start of by saying that i've seen (and i'm estimating the years) <br/>
1996's Hideyoshi, the Nobunaga drama sometime prior to that, 1997's <br/>
Mori Motonari, 1999's Tokugawa Yoshinobu, and the first 5 episodes of <br/>
Aoi ~ Tokugawa Sandai.  I'd have to say that out of those, Mori <br/>
Motonari was my favorite - most of it was pretty new to me, and for <br/>
the most part it had some excellent acting, but above all else, the <br/>
makeup surpasses all the previous drama.  I think they must have <br/>
added a little grey or a few wrinkles each episode, making the aging <br/>
look so natural.  After it was over, and i went back and watched the <br/>
first few episodes again, i was surprised at how young everyone <br/>
looked.  Apparently it was more or less a bomb in Japan, but one of <br/>
my favorites.  Hideyoshi would come up #2 for the entertainment value <br/>
alone - Takenaka Naoto is one of my favorite Japanese actors.  I was <br/>
also impressed by Sekigahara at the begining of Tokugawa Sandai, <br/>
although apparently others weren't as impressed as I was...<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1243027315">Mori Motonari was one of the better ones recently. My all time favorite<br/>
would have to be SANADA TAIHEIKI about Sanada Yukimura. DOKU GANRYU<br/>
MASAMUNE, about Date Masamune was also a good production.<br/>
    Overall I would have to say the "Soap-opera" factor, including as many<br/>
women characters as possible along with romances and comedy has detracted<br/>
from the historical atmosphere. Also the faces of the actors and the make<br/>
up on the actresses defies ones suspension of disbelief. They all look like<br/>
salarymen and office ladies, seems a good Edo or Muromachi period "kao" is<br/>
impossible to find these days.<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I'd have to agree with that, especially Mii in Motonari, although it <br/>
wasnt quite so bad in Hideyoshi, and was fairly believable in <br/>
Yoshinobu.  although, as far as 'comedy' I did like Hideyoshi - which <br/>
was apparently the first stab at making it more available to general <br/>
audiences.  although i believe the better the actors the less money <br/>
they have left over for battle scenes.  That's why I liked Nobunaga - <br/>
King of Zipangu.  <br/>
<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I was thinking the same thing re-watching 'Motonari' - the army <br/>
seemed to be made up of 35 year old salaryment, huffing and puffing <br/>
thier way to battle.<br/>
