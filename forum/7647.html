<br/>
An organization specializing in the "Chushingura," one of the most <br/>
famous kabuki tales in Japan telling the true story of more than 40 <br/>
masterless samurai who committed suicide after taking vengeance on <br/>
behalf of their master, is now offering a proficiency exam on the <br/>
historical events.<br/>
<br/>
The Tokyo-based organization, Chuo Gishikai, established <br/>
the "Chushingura-tsu Kentei Shiken" (Chushingura expert <br/>
certification test) to help ordinary people learn more about the <br/>
Chushingura, which is based on events that occurred over 300 years <br/>
ago.<br/>
<br/>
The first test will be held on Dec. 18, in 10 locations across <br/>
Japan, including Tokyo and Ako, Hyogo Prefecture, the area where the <br/>
incident involving 47 masterless samurai took place.<br/>
<br/>
The Chuo Gishikai was established in 1912, and in 1919 it was <br/>
approved as an incorporated foundation. It conducts research and <br/>
holds lectures relating to the loyal retainers of Ako, and has <br/>
produced several publications. About 300 people belong to the <br/>
organization.<br/>
<br/>
In the past, the group held a "Chushingura doctoral test" for its <br/>
members, but the latest test marks the first time the doors have <br/>
been opened to the public. The exam consists of 50 multiple choice <br/>
and written questions, testing people on their general knowledge of <br/>
the 47 masterless samurai and the historical events surrounding the <br/>
incident. Applicants need to correctly answer 40 of the questions <br/>
correctly during the 90-minute test period to pass.<br/>
<br/>
Results will be posted to applicants within a month of the test. <br/>
Those who pass will receive a certificate from the organization and <br/>
the qualification of "Chushingura instructor." The organization will <br/>
reportedly introduce those who pass to teaching jobs if they are <br/>
interested. The cost of sitting the test is 10,000 yen.<br/>
<br/>
"We want as many people as possible to take the test and deepen <br/>
their knowledge," a Chuo Gishikai official said.<br/>
<br/>
The Chushingura is based on an incident in the early 1700s, in which <br/>
a group of masterless samurai who had served under Asano Naganori <br/>
banded together to kill Kira Yoshinaka, a retainer of the Tokugawa <br/>
Shogunate, in retaliation for actions that resulted in Asano being <br/>
ordered to commit suicide. The incident has been repeated in <br/>
numerous plays and stories, and the Chuo Gishikai has described the <br/>
Chushingura as "an asset of Japan's spiritual culture." (Mainichi)<br/>
