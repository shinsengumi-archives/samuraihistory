-------------------------<br/>
 <br/>
Here's a chance to step back into the past and revel in the mysteries <br/>
of old Japan. <br/>
<br/>
Four centuries after his death, the spirit of warlord Tokugawa Ieyasu <br/>
still draws visitors to the fabulously ornate Nikko Toshogu shrine in <br/>
Nikko, Tochigi Prefecture. In fact, the sense of history can be <br/>
almost overwhelming-with enactments of the samurai period associated <br/>
with Ieyasu (1542-1616) and the shogunate set up in his family name. <br/>
<br/>
The remains of the founder of Edo, modern Tokyo, are enshrined at <br/>
Toshogu, which every year organizes spectacular parades re-enacting <br/>
rites of old Japan. <br/>
<br/>
This tops the list of must-see events. The climax comes when more <br/>
than 1,000 local people in period costume parade down avenues graced <br/>
with huge pine trees. As many as 53 groups are represented, including <br/>
fully armored warriors from the days of old, as well as shrine <br/>
maidens and others dressed as lions to guard against evil. <br/>
<br/>
It is called Sennin Musha Gyoretsu, literally procession of 1,000 <br/>
warriors. It is said to re-enact a procession in 1617 when Ieyasu's <br/>
followers transported his remains to the newly built Nikko shrine <br/>
from the Kunozan mountain in Shizuoka Prefecture, where they had been <br/>
temporarily enshrined. <br/>
<br/>
At the head of the procession is a portable shrine that is said to <br/>
honor Ieyasu's spirit. The procession makes its way from the shrine <br/>
down a narrow street for about 1 kilometer and then heads back. <br/>
<br/>
Another day trip out of Tokyo that features warriors is the <br/>
Tsurugaoka Hachimangu shrine's Reitaisai festival in the old capital <br/>
of Kamakura in Kanagawa Prefecture. <br/>
<br/>
This is really something. It features yabusame, where mounted archers <br/>
fire arrows at three stationary targets while riding at full gallop <br/>
along a fenced-off 254-meter narrow strip of dirt. <br/>
<br/>
Be warned, the crowds will be huge. <br/>
<br/>
It is said this ritual was initiated by Minamoto no Yoritomo (1147-<br/>
1199), founder of the Kamakura Shogunate (1192-1333), in hopes to <br/>
bringing lasting peace to the warring states. <br/>
<br/>
Historical figures such as the warlord Minamoto no Yoshitsune (1159-<br/>
1189) are also featured in the summer and autumn festivals of Sawara, <br/>
Chiba Prefecture. <br/>
<br/>
They feature elaborately decorated floats with 4-meter dolls of <br/>
figures from Japan's ancient past. The dolls, each representing one <br/>
of 14 local communities, are paraded around the city, which is noted <br/>
for its buildings dating from the Edo Period (1603-1867). <br/>
