 </span></blockquote>I would be extremely hesistant to quote any measurements made before the <br/>
1850's to this level of accuracy. In period I suspect they varied by <br/>
10-20% easily unless they had a national standards department with <br/>
enforcement. I seem to remember that surveying was was introduced in the <br/>
Meiji period and there was controversy about uniform measurements. This <br/>
may of been over Western measurements however.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>	In the study of Japanese Art swords all descriptions are <br/>
given in Sun Shaku and in CM.s a good grasp of the equivalents goes a <br/>
long way to help visualize blades being discussed.<br/>
	In Iaido and I suspect other martial arts it is not uncommon <br/>
for sun shaku measures to be used in teaching forms and stances. <br/>
Swords for Iai are measured and sold in sun shaku, as are sageo, obi <br/>
and tabi...<br/>
