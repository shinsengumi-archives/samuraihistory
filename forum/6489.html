Sorry not to have responded earlier but have only just returned home from Australia. The Connoiseur's Book of Japanese Swords was essentially written as an aid to kantei or sword appraisal. I would say that it is for the rather more advanced collector rather than the beginner or less keen collector but is an essential reference for the dedicated. (I was somewhat involved in the translation and wroter the Intro so am somewhat bias maybe!)<br/>
