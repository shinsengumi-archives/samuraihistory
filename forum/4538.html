Are you aware of the fact that the Mein Kampf was written in the early <br/>
twenties and the systematic killing of Jewish (=the final solution) <br/>
began 20 years later? A few things had changed in the meantime, just <br/>
check out two maps of Europe from 1924 and 1941, for example... Do you <br/>
think hitler was the same person with the same agenda?? And do you <br/>
think he had the same amount of power and the same number of neurons??<br/>

Perhaps vegetarian, but Christian I don't think so...<br/>
Ahem: "Thou shalt not kill" ???<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Ok, but two very different kind of absolutisms, pointing different <br/>
goals, in different centuries, in different centuries, blah... blah... <br/>
blah... you can't say two individuals are the same just because they're <br/>
both absolutists.<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Once again, I really believe he killed most people for economic reasons <br/>
and because he was a madman. Nobunaga was no madman. He was a ruthless <br/>
warrior, who killed a lot of people, but with a clearly defined goal in <br/>
his mind, a goal that MANY in Japan today still consider the greater <br/>
good: unification of the country, before Japan was unified as a colony <br/>
under China or a Western power...<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>So, your theory is: both Hitler and Nobunaga killed non-christisns, so <br/>
they're the same?<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Sorry, but the stories and you've heard and the manga you've read do <br/>
not make very impressive historical sources. My wife is Japanese, and <br/>
she does not tell Nobunaga stories to our kid (actually she likes him a <br/>
lot-so eventually would be positive stories.) So, we're 1-1, at least.<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I do believe you're sincere, but we're talking history here, non <br/>
opinions based (it seems) upon fragmentary sources.<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Well, I am a graduate student in Japanese history, and I teach World <br/>
History. The professor I study with is one of the best in the world in <br/>
traditional Japan history.<br/>
I believe by now I know a bit about how to manage sources.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> > For an example... Who cares if you didn´t believe in what I stated <br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Pali is an old Indian language, the vulgar version of Sanskrit. What <br/>
has this to do with what we were talking about???!?!?!??!??!?! Do I <br/>
need more Asahi Dry????<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> > In fact, is what even Buddha recomended to<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Wow. I'd wish you can stick to the point, and make things clearer.<br/>
Do you have a greater theory?<br/>
I am still not clear on Nobunaga & Hitler, let alone the sacrifices....<br/>
