<div id="ygrps-yiv-958526084">Hi all,<br/>
 Regarding the question of sword length and which Samurai used the longest it <br/>
would be near impossible to know for certain the answer.<br/>
 What I can tell you is that there were several Ryu that taught techniques <br/>
specifically designed for use with extremely long Katana...The most famous of <br/>
these was the Kage ryu (which the above mentioned Sasaki Kojiro was <br/>
reportedly a member of..)<br/>
 There is an excellent site on the schools techniques and swords with <br/>
excellent photographs showing some truly incredible swords. (one the same <br/>
size as the man holding it!) <br/>
 Check out; www.bunbun.ne.jp/~sword/Nkage1.html<br/>
 The site is run by Colin Hyakutake, a practitioner of both the Kage ryu and <br/>
the Hyoho Niten Ichi Ryu (The school that Miyamoto Musashi was Ryuso or <br/>
founder of). And is an excellent place for information on these and other <br/>
'Ken' related questions.<br/>
 Hope this helps.<br/>
 Abayo.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-845971267">Hi all,<br/>
 I mentioned this earlier in a reply..But here it is again. Try www.koryu.com and when you get there visit the Ryu list they have (under 'schools' heading)..Take a look at the 'Kage Ryu' write up and in particular the photos and sited they have. There are excellent photos of the previous head of the school with his Tachi that is easily as tall as he is.. The Tsuka is about the length of my arm!<br/>
