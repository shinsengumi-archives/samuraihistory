<br/>
The Korea-Japan dispute over Dokdo, recently sparked again by <br/>
Japanese territorial claim to the islands, is a long-pending issue <br/>
between the two nations, but often ignored by Western countries. <br/>
An English novel "Dokdo Is Our Land - A War on Dokdo," was written <br/>
to refute the Japanese claim. Henry H. Hong, who spent 15 years <br/>
working on the book, hopes his book will call Westerners' attention <br/>
to Korea and challenge them to rethink their views on the matter. <br/>
<br/>
The author, both a Christian minister and a professor, has a <br/>
reputation for promoting cross-cultural understanding and friendship <br/>
between Korean-Americans and African-Americans while he lived in the <br/>
United States. <br/>
<br/>
The novel is based on a true story of Ahn Yong-bok, a Korean <br/>
fisherman in the 17th century, who controlled Ulleung Island in the <br/>
East Sea and drove out all Japanese fishermen and pirates from the <br/>
area. The author depicts vividly the loyalty and love of characters <br/>
such as Ahn and Okio who later becomes the wife of the seventh <br/>
shogun of Japan. One day, Yong-bok's love, Yooyoo, is kidnapped by <br/>
Japanese pirates. To save her, Yongbok sails to Japan and sneaks <br/>
into Edo. However, due to a trivial incident, he is accused of two <br/>
crimes and thrown in jail. However, Okio, whom he had previously <br/>
rescued from her hardships, helps Yongbok and falls in love with <br/>
him. Through her, he manages to see Tsunayoshi, the fifth shogun of <br/>
Japan's Tokugawa feudal government. In front of the shogun, Yong-bok <br/>
asserts that the Ulleung Island and the nearby Dokdo have belonged <br/>
to Joseon since the Shilla Kingdom period and finally succeeds in <br/>
persuading the shogun to admit that the two islands are part of <br/>
Joseon. <br/>
<br/>
Hong plans to have his novel translated into several other <br/>
languages. The Korean edition is scheduled to be released in <br/>
September, followed by Japanese and Chinese versions. <br/>
