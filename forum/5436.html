How did a 'divine wind' save Japan from Mongolian invaders 700 years <br/>
ago?<br/>
By Hideko Takayama<br/>
Newsweek<br/>
<br/>
Aug. 16 issue - Kublai Khan was a conqueror of boundless appetite. <br/>
When Japan refused to obey and pay tribute to the Mongolian ruler, he <br/>
was outraged. Twice during the 13th century he sent massive fleets to <br/>
invade Japan, possibly trying to seize its storied gold. Each time, <br/>
though, the khan's aggression was repelled not by the Japanese <br/>
military but by sudden storms that killed most of the invaders and <br/>
destroyed their ships. The Japanese dubbed these storms kamikaze, or <br/>
divine wind.<br/>
<br/>
That's the myth, but what exactly happened in the high seas more than <br/>
700 years ago? Archeologists have been trying for decades to nail <br/>
down the specifics. From which direction did the kamikaze blow? How <br/>
strong was it? For that matter, how big were the Mongolian ships? And <br/>
how did they manage to sink? Now, more than seven centuries after the <br/>
fact, Japanese archeologists are finally getting some answers. <br/>
Artifacts uncovered in an expedition that ended last week tell more <br/>
about the battles that took place off the coast of the tiny island of <br/>
Takashima at the mouth of Imari Bay, 1,000 kilometers southwest of <br/>
Tokyo.<br/>
<br/>
Digging up the sea bottom to salvage the pieces from the Mongols' <br/>
invasions is a difficult task, to say the least. Excavations that <br/>
started in the 1980s, now led by Kenzo Hayashida, archeologist and <br/>
president of the Kyushu and Okinawa Society for Underwater <br/>
Archaeology, managed to uncover many ceramic jars used for <br/>
containers. In recent years his team found Mongolian pottery-shelled <br/>
bombs, swords, large anchors and a bowl with Chinese characters that <br/>
belonged to a 100-man unit under a commander named Wang. In July his <br/>
team of scientists and divers worked on a site about 70 meters from <br/>
the shore and 13 meters below the surface of the sea. By pumping <br/>
water through a hose and suctioning up the sand, they found human-<br/>
skull parts, animal bones, timbers from the ships and an anchor rope.<br/>
<br/>
Hayashida and his crew fell short of finding an intact ship. The <br/>
reason: shipworms most likely have reduced these once mighty vessels <br/>
to shards. "It is like having 4,000 different sets of puzzles," says <br/>
Randall Sasaki, a graduate student in the nautical-archeology program <br/>
at Texas A&M University who was a member of Hayashida's team. "Those <br/>
pieces were put in a blender of sea and were mixed together. It is <br/>
difficult to figure out which piece goes to which ship." Judging by <br/>
the hundreds of wooden pieces the team turned up, as well as those <br/>
from earlier expeditions, Hayashida thinks that some of the ships of <br/>
the Mongolian fleet could have been 40 meters, and made in Chinese or <br/>
Korean ports.<br/>
<br/>
Today the island (population: 2,800) is covered with lush green pine <br/>
and sweet-acorn trees, and the fishermen pride themselves on their <br/>
tasty blowfish. It's hard to imagine that this bucolic island was the <br/>
site of two of the biggest and most devastating sea battles in <br/>
history. Experts say that some 40,000 soldiers aboard 900 wooden <br/>
ships attacked northern Kyushu in 1274 and killed virtually <br/>
Takashima's entire population. For some unknown reason, the fleet <br/>
left after two weeks and was destroyed by the divine wind on its way <br/>
back home. In the second invasion, in 1281, 140,000 soldiers arrived <br/>
in 4,400 ships. When the typhoon hit Imari Bay that summer, about <br/>
3,000 ships and 100,000 soldiers are believed to have vanished under <br/>
the sea.<br/>
<br/>
Shinji Takano, archeologist with the Nagasaki Prefectural Board of <br/>
Education, thinks that the fleet gathered in the bay to let the <br/>
typhoon pass. A study of a Southern Sung dynasty military ship <br/>
excavated in China, which may have been similar in design to the <br/>
Mongolian ships, shows that a wind of nearly 200kmh would have been <br/>
enough to destroy the ships. Takano thinks that a mega typhoon wind <br/>
blew from the south to the shore. "The bay was packed with their <br/>
ships. They must have tied their ships to one another to stay <br/>
together," he says. The strong wind and high waves probably crushed <br/>
them, and they sank.<br/>
<br/>
Hayashida's expedition is hardly the last word. So far his team has <br/>
not covered even 1 percent of the battleground. If he can find the <br/>
money and manpower to continue his work, we can expect a lot more <br/>
details to unfold about the Mongolian invasion attempts.<br/>
