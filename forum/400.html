<br/>
The sword was in the dominant hand. I've fenced with many a lefty.<br/>
<br/>
For the record, sword-and-shield  combat is the opposite of fencing. In the<br/>
former, the shield side is in FRONT (because the shield is BETWEEN you and<br/>
the opponent) and if you're left handed that puts your "heart" closer to the<br/>
opponent, and the sword farther back. In fencing, your sword is out in front<br/>
because you want the maximum distance between you and the opponent. If you're<br/>
a lefty, your left side faces; if a righty, your right side faces.<br/>
<br/>
There have been left-handed rapiers and so on, so it's pretty clear that<br/>
there were lefties fighting in Europe.<br/>

<h3>Slightly off topic - consider the Sou&#39;paws</h3>

<br/>
In my father's time, in Catholic Ireland, children is school were<br/>
still being 'trained out' of being left handed for entirely <br/>
superstitious reasons.<br/>
<br/>
I wonder if this practice was common in Medieval Christian Europe?<br/>
(left being sinister - bar sinister in heraldry, etc), which would <br/>
account for relatively few left-handers.<br/>
<br/>
Thinking about musical instruments, although with modern guitars,<br/>
etc. I've seen left handers (Paul McCartney) - I don't recollect <br/>
seeing left handers in orchestras. Is allowing for left-handedness <br/>
a modern practice?<br/>
<br/>
I am a designer, and being right-handed is a disadvantage! Left<br/>
handedness is supposedly a sign of creativity (left brain/right brain <br/>
thing). Whilst I am partially ambidextrous the only 'benefit' I know <br/>
is an absolutely crap sense of direction!<br/>

In my strategy, the training for killing enemies is by way of many contests, fighting for survival, discovering the meaning of life and death, learning the Way of the sword, judging the strength of attacks and understanding the Way of the "edge and ridge" of the sword. <br/>
