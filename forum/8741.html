<h3>NEW Samurai Archives online forum community</h3>
by <i>kitsuno</i>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-587927276">I have developed a new all encompasing forum with the assistance of<br/>
Kryo, who you'll see there. It is the Samurai Archives Citadel- 3<br/>
"locations" spanning 13 different Japanese history and culture related<br/>
forums rolled into one giant community:<br/>
<br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://samurai.threespursdesign.com/index.php">http://samurai.threespursdesign.com/index.php</a><br/>
<br/>
Here are a few of the locations within the Citadel:<br/>
<br/>
The Genkan: The first stop for new people joining the group, with info<br/>
on how the forum works, and where you can ask technical forum<br/>
questions, "how to..." etc.<br/>
<br/>
Samurai History: Basically, what we have here.<br/>
<br/>
Ancient Japan: A forum for discussion of Japanese history through the<br/>
Heian period - Hosted by Nagaeyari.<br/>
<br/>
Arms and Armor: A forum for the discussion of arms and armor of the<br/>
Samurai - Hosted by Tony.<br/>
<br/>
Japanese Language: A forum for all questions and things related to the<br/>
Japanese language - Also hosted by Tony.<br/>
<br/>
The Bakumatsu: The latest part of the Tokugawa era, the Bakumatsu<br/>
period is one of the most agitated and romanticized part of Japanese<br/>
history. It is the age of the last samurai, of intense fighting<br/>
between the pro-emperor ishin shishi from Satsuma and Choshu and the<br/>
pro-shogunate Shinsengumi troops.<br/>
<br/>
Japanese Entertainment: A forum for all Japanese entertainment, music,<br/>
drama, movies, and anime.<br/>
<br/>
There are also various goodies like Avatars and ranks based the number<br/>
of posts a person makes, and as forum Shogun, I can also bestow titles<br/>
upon members at will.  The forum is brand new, so there are still many<br/>
things that will be added and changed, but I invite everyone here to<br/>
go join up and see what is there.<br/>
<br/>
This yahoo group will continue to exist, as I know some people like to<br/>
be able to get and send emails, because it is easier than checking<br/>
websites, particularly at work. But definately go ahead and sign up at<br/>
the Samurai Archives Citadel - it will eventually become the main<br/>
point of contact for all people interested in various aspects of Japan.</div>
