<h3>Samurai and Secret Communication?</h3>
by <i>Chris Spackman</i>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-454354553">Hi all, I'm new around here and have a question maybe someone can help<br/>
me with.<br/>
<br/>
David Kahn's book "The Codebreakers" deals with the history of codes,<br/>
ciphers and cryptanalysis. Most of the book deals with Europe---from<br/>
Caesar ciphers to the European black chambers. Japan only gets<br/>
mentioned toward the end---WWII of course.<br/>
<br/>
Now most people with an interest in Japan know about the Allied<br/>
efforts to decipher and read Japanese codes in WWII.<br/>
<br/>
But what about earlier? Did the samurai (daimyo mostly i would assume)<br/>
use any sort of secret writing? Did their messangers just carry<br/>
plaintext documents? If so, were there any cases of intercepted<br/>
messages affecting strategy or even individual battles?<br/>
<br/>
I know the Church was using codes / ciphers in the 1500's, so I would<br/>
image that the missionaries in Japan would have at least known the<br/>
basics of cryptography. (Especially the Jesuits). Maybe they taught<br/>
some to a few daimyo?<br/>
<br/>
I've done a little bit of research but haven't been able to find much.<br/>
Any one know of any good sources for this topic?<br/>

 </span></blockquote>I know of no good sources, there are stories about Date Masamune, whose<br/>
secret letters were captured and used by Hideyoshi to accuse him of<br/>
wrongdoing and he avoided punishment by pointing out that his "secret"<br/>
signature was not on the letter. This scene is retold and replayed in novels<br/>
and movies by various characters. The message itself was plaintext if I<br/>
recall.<br/>
    The Takeda used smoke signals to move info across large distances in a<br/>
hurry, surely they had codes for this. The info you seek may not be in ONE<br/>
book but in books on specific han Lords and or battles.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-431660747">Hello all...<br/>
 I train with the Genbukan Ninpo Bugei and have seen a book by my Grandmaster <br/>
Tanemura Shoto Sensei in which he describes various methods of 'Aizu' and <br/>
'Ango' Jutsu...signalling techniques that have been handed down from around <br/>
the 15th century<br/>
 "Aizu are ways of making secret signals, such as using smoke, a mirror or <br/>
other shiny metal object, flags, coloured rice, or noise such as from a shell <br/>
horn (Conch, presumably), hand held drum, large drum or bell."<br/>
Ninpo secrets-Tanemura Shoto<br/>
 It is also in the book that the Shinobi agents from the 'Iga' region (in Mie <br/>
prefecture) used written codes 'Ango' that they called the 'shinobi iroha' <br/>
commonly using basic Kanji (chinese characters) as left radicals and colours <br/>
as right radicals and combining them in such a way as to form the Japanese <br/>
'Kana' (type of sound alphabet) to form words with.<br/>
 There are also various other methods using Kana and Kanji but the essentials <br/>
are there...The Kenshin ryu used a method known as 'Shichiji no Kana' with <br/>
seven (Hira) kana along the top row to form a sentance that was predetermined <br/>
and a further seven kana running down the page in another sentance...If the <br/>
agent knew the beginning phrases the Hiragana characters were placed in to <br/>
the field and looking at the combinations he could decipher the code.<br/>
 These are only basic methods and very similar to modern code structures but <br/>
a little experimentation could allow practically any code to be set up using <br/>
these methods. <br/>
 As mentioned the Takeda clan used large signalling fires that were placed <br/>
upon long (pivoted) sticks that were raised by a few men to signal groups <br/>
further down the battle lines. The Takeda network of fires was <br/>
immense...apparently covering southern Shinano, Kai and the surrounding <br/>
province borders. Ithink their methods and strategys are contained in 'Heiho <br/>
Okugisho' by Yamamoto Kansuke..a legendary retainer of Shingen ko.<br/>
 Hope this waffle helps you out....</div>

 </span></blockquote>Thanks, I'll look into Date Masamune. I was beginning to fear that<br/>
samurai / daimyo never used code.<br/>
<br/>
Maybe Japanese use of codes may be more appropriate to the<br/>
Meiji Restoration or the Sino-Japanese war, possible even the<br/>
Russo-Japanese war.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>YES! Much more likely then as they would definitely be under the influence<br/>
of European military practice. I am sure the info on earlier periods is out<br/>
there, good hunting.<br/>
