<div id="ygrps-yiv-875347796">(snip) Hey, as an<br/>
aside, my husband's been practicing kendo for about thirty years. We<br/>
recently watched 'Ghost Dog' and hubby went into a fit of spleen. It<br/>
seems the main character puts a katana back into its sheath UPSIDE-<br/>
DOWN- he's slice his thumb open if he tried to do that in real life.<br/>
(Giggle. Snort. Chuckle.)<br/>
<br/>
God, will it ever end?<br/>

<br/>
	To be sure, the sword work in "Ghost Dog" was the weakest part... Whittaker<br/>
also does a wrist-twist that's more Filipino stick than Japanese sword (the<br/>
same move we see Cruise execute in solo practise in "Last Samurai," for that<br/>
matter).  But "Ghost Dog" wasn't really about the Way of the Sword, so much<br/>
as the Way of the Warrior.<br/>
	And it worked quite brilliantly as that, a modern man's search for a way to<br/>
live out his vision of Bushido in the context of urban America.  His loyalty<br/>
is pure, and what gives him strength is that he's the only one who<br/>
understands the story he's written of his life.  His own 'lord' doesn't get<br/>
it, although he works with it.  One of the bosses is old-world enough to<br/>
understand the kind of man who's after him, and most of the mob soldiers are<br/>
living essentially as samurai - that is, they're household warriors serving<br/>
a specific family, with their loyalty and their skills determining their<br/>
status in the household structure - but they don't realise themselves what<br/>
an old-world power structure they live in, and the Whittaker character does.<br/>
	What I saw in Whittaker's sword work was a man who had decided he ought to<br/>
practise this, but had no instruction.  As I recall, his combat handgun work<br/>
was rather well done.  So the weak sword style seemed a flaw that was<br/>
consistently in character.<br/>
	Besides, recall that before katana, swords were sheathed in a style that<br/>
would look "upside-down" to a modern kendo practitioner.  Look at the way a<br/>
tachi is rigged for wear.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Just keep in mind the character he plays is INSANE, probably <br/>
schizophrenic, and is not a "modern Samurai" except in his insanity.</div>
