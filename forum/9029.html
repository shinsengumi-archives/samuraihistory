<h3>SAMURAI SWORD EXHIBITION IN VICTORIA, AUSTRALIA</h3>
by <i>Barry Thomas</i>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-2082677319">Dear Blokes 'n' Sheilas,<br/>
<br/>
Recently my collecting friends and I exhibited some of our swords at the Benalla<br/>
Art Gallery in country Victoria for two months.  When that ended we installed a<br/>
larger exhibition at the Hamilton Art Gallery also in country Victoria.  To look<br/>
at pictures of the Hamilton exhibition please go to:<br/>
<br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.nihontokanjipages.com/personal/hamilton/hamilton_2006.html">http://www.nihontokanjipages.com/personal/hamilton/hamilton_2006.html</a><br/>
<br/>
The swords on exhibition range from ca1260 to ca1860, all found in Victoria and<br/>
professionally restored in Japan by a top artisan.  Each sword has been examined<br/>
by eminent scholars of the Nihonto at the NBTHK sword museum in Tokyo and<br/>
awarded a "paper" certifying its authenticity and art-level (there are 4 ranks<br/>
of "paper").  This is the largest ever exhibition of properly restored and<br/>
authenticated Japanese art swords ever held in the Southern Hemisphere.  There<br/>
is also a link to the Hamilton Art Gallery itself, and a link to a downloadable<br/>
pdf catalogue - the Gallery are currently charging $5 for the catalogues they<br/>
have...<br/>
<br/>
I would like to publicly thank and acknowledge the expertise of our mate in<br/>
collecting, Richard Turner in Perth, for his fantastic help in setting these<br/>
images up for sharing with others.<br/>
<br/>
Best regards,<br/>
<br/>
Barry Thomas.</div>

<h3>Japan history reading group: reading the bio of Hideyoshi</h3>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-909730623">Dear all.<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
The Japan history reading group, Nihonshi, has just completed reading the<br/>
Tale of Genji. Now this month, we are reading Mary Elizabeth Berry's bio of<br/>
Hideyoshi. I've finished reading Berry's book, and it is excellent. I've<br/>
posted a summary of Hideyoshi's life at the group website. If any of you<br/>
notice any inaccuracies or have any suggested amendments to my description<br/>
of Hideyoshi's life on the Nihonshi website, please email me. <br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
The group's website is here.<br/>

<br/>
Also, anyone who wishes can certainly subscribe to the Nihonshi group and<br/>
join us in our reading of Japan's history. We take our history seriously,<br/>
but we do it in a casual and sometimes irreverent way. Politically incorrect<br/>

     How much coverage does the book give to the Imjin War (the Japanese <br/>
invasion of Korea)?<br/>

<h3>[samuraihistory] Japan history reading group: reading the bio of Hideyoshi</h3>
by <i>sinegalm</i>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-31802227">Dear Bob.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks for the email question on the Hideyoshi biography. Berry's book does discuss somewhat the Korean invasions, but the author does not go into intricate detail of the Korean invasions. She does not focus on blow by blow of the battles in Korea. She focuses far more on the battles within Japan to consolidate Hideyoshi's power over Japan itself, and his forming alliances within Japan. She also focuses more on when Hideyoshi was willing to show clemency even with defeated foes, like Chosokabe Motochika in Shikoku and Sassa Narimasa in Hokuriku. (Of course, the clemency toward Sassa didn’t last long, as he was forced to commit suicide some time later.) She also of course describes the more brutal, ruthless side of Hideyoshi, where he defeats and destroys Shibata Katsuie, and others. She also spends time discussing the social transformation of the disarming of the peasants and monks, as well as the stripping the samurai of their land. She describes how all of these moves were designed to stabilize the country by making rebellion by peasants and monks less likely. Also, by stripping samurai of land, the samurai themselves became more dependent on their lords and daimyo, also making samurai less likely to make trouble independent of their daimyo. So the daimyo gave up some independence to Hideyoshi as the supreme central power, but the daimyo also acquired a certain new power vis-à-vis those peasants and samurai below them on the social hierarchy.<br/>
<br/>
Do you have a particular interest in Korea, or in those particular Japanese invasions of Korea?<br/>

     Thanks for the description of the book.   I've been interested in the <br/>
Japanese Invasion of Korea for a while now.   In fact, I've posted a very <br/>
detailed bibliography about the Imjin War to the group's files.<br/>
<br/>
     The Korean TV miniseries about Admiral Yi is being released on DVD next <br/>
week.   It's a two box set.   Originally, it was only going to be released on <br/>
Region 3 format (Southeast Asia) which meant we wouldn't be able to watch it <br/>
on US DVD players.<br/>
<br/>
     I don't know if my inquiry had anything to do with it, but after I <br/>
inquired about the series I was told that it was going to be released on an All <br/>
Region format, so we will be able to watch it here in the US.<br/>
<br/>
     Here's the website if you want to read about it <<br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.dvdfromkorea.com/">http://www.dvdfromkorea.com/</a>>.   Just do a search for "Admiral Yi".<br/>
