<h3>Saito Dousan, Oil Merchant...?</h3>
by <i>kitsuno</i>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-160016709">It has always seemed 'common knowledge' that Saito Dousan was an oil <br/>
merchant who became Daimyo (or at least that is how it has always <br/>
seemed) but I'm reading a general history of the sengoku period that <br/>
claims that all of the 'oil merchant' stories attributed to Dousan <br/>
are actually from his father, and Dousan was already a Samurai upon <br/>
birth:<br/>
<br/>
(A quick and easy translation from Japanese - &#25126;&#22269;&#26178;&#20195; by &#37329;&#35895;&#20426;&#19968;&#37070; <br/>
2003 p.50-51)<br/>
<br/>
"Saito Dousan's father Shinzaemonjou was a monk at the myoukakuji <br/>
temple in Kyoto, however he gave up the priesthood and married, <br/>
becoming the son in law of an oil merchant.  During his travels as an <br/>
oil merchant himself, he ran into a friend from his days as a monk at <br/>
myoukakuji, who was now an abbot at the Jouzaiji temple in Mino <br/>
province.  The abbot was a relative of the Nagai clan, which was <br/>
serving the Shugo of Mino, the Toki clan.  Through the abbot, <br/>
Shinzaemonjou gained employment with Nagai Nagahiro, and quickly rose <br/>
through the Nagai ranks, eventually taking the surname of Nagai.  In <br/>
1525, he assisted Nagahiro in subduing both the Toki clan (the Shugo) <br/>
and the Saito clan (the Shugo-dai) in a coup.  In 1533, Dousan, who <br/>
at this time was known as Nagai Shinkurou Norihide, succeeded his <br/>
father, and killed his father's benefactor, Nagai Nagahiro, and took <br/>
possesion of Inabayama castle from him."<br/>
<br/>
Is it too much to ask for an english source or two??  :P<br/>
<br/>
One website says: "The castle was once called Inabayama Castle. The <br/>
area has been a strategic point for centuries given its close <br/>
proximity to Sekigahara, a mountain pass through which trade and <br/>
communication routes link eastern and western Japan. Saito Dosan, a <br/>
onetime resident of Mt. Kinka, once said "If you control Sekigahara, <br/>
you control Japan." Taken by Nagai Sinzaemon in 1525 his retainer <br/>
Saito Dosan usurped him in 1542 and ruled the area until Yoshiatsu, <br/>
Saito's son, killed his father in a battle on the banks of the Nagara <br/>
River." (<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.asahi-u.ac.jp/kagai/kokusai/gifuchina/gifu-">http://www.asahi-u.ac.jp/kagai/kokusai/gifuchina/gifu-</a><br/>
eng/history.htm)<br/>
<br/>
However the history book I'm reading seems to be saying that his <br/>
father was Nagai Shinzaemon, and I cant find any other sources to <br/>
confirm or deny this, or the fact that it was dousan's father, and <br/>
not dousan himself who was the oil merchant.</div>

 </span></blockquote>(Your Japanese didnt come out in the post for me, but anyway) that <br/>
occured to me, but the furigana was included, and left out the 'no' <br/>
for: &#26032;&#24038;&#34907;&#38272;&#23561;<br/>
<br/>
<br/>

し, although I have seen it rendered as "Kichihoushi" &#12365;&#12385;&#12411;&#12358;&#12375;. The <br/>
first character of the name is 吉 which is "kichi" all by itself.<br/>

I think that in a lot of cases we just can't be sure how the names <br/>
were actually pronounced. This may indeed be one of them.<br/>
<br/>
I personally go with Kippoushi for Nobunaga. But this isn't really <br/>
based on anything other than my sense that the more serious works on <br/>
Nobunaga seem to go with Kippoushi. For instancy my copy of the <br/>
ShinChou KouKi &#20449;&#38263;&#20844;&#35352; uses Kippoushi.<br/>

though before I got too far into it real life got in the way. I've <br/>
never seen a full translation into English. I still have plans to <br/>
continue my private translation - "someday". :)<br/>
<br/>
In Japanese, there are a few versions on the web. The one I like the <br/>
most is the one at <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.page.sannet.ne.jp/gutoku2/kouki.html">http://www.page.sannet.ne.jp/gutoku2/kouki.html</a><br/>
Interestingly, in translating the work into modern Japanese, that site <br/>
uses both &#12365;&#12385;&#12411;&#12358;&#12375;&#12288;and &#12365;&#12387;&#12413;&#12358;&#12375; in different places.<br/>
<br/>
As for harcopy, I have ISBN 4-404-02493-2. The ISBN may be more <br/>
convenient than the title when you're looking on Amazon or bookstores. <br/>
The title is just "&#20449;&#38263;&#20844;&#35352;". It is annotated by Kuwata Tadachika 桑田<br/>

were found in portugese diaries and other paperwork from the 16th <br/>
century, because the names were written phoenetically.  I seem to <br/>
remember that one of the names they dont know how it was 'spelled' <br/>
(for lack of a better term) was Nobunaga's son Nobuo/Nobukatsu.</div>

<h3>Help with kanji and kana on my computer</h3>

Okay I have what is hopefully a simple problem. Every time some one<br/>

<br/>
You should be able to left click on the text of the<br/>
email, and a menu will pop up--go to "Encoding" and<br/>
click on it. It will show various encoding...probably<br/>
set to "Western European". If Japanese isn't shown<br/>
there, go to "more", then click on "Japanese-Auto<br/>
Select"...that should change the encoding you read the<br/>
email through, to allow kanji to be read. It will<br/>
still show the English, though sometimes I forget to<br/>
change things back, and I'll see random kanji through<br/>
other pages. <br/>
<br/>
If you can't find the "Japanese-Auto Select", you may<br/>
have to activate it through your control panel. <br/>

<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1317724101">All--<br/>
<br/>
I've uploaded three folders of photos to the Group<br/>
website. You can take a look at <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://groups.yahoo.com/group/samuraihistory/">http://groups.yahoo.com/group/samuraihistory/</a><br/>

and click on "photos". <br/>
<br/>
New photos are in folders:<br/>
<br/>
Kusunoki and Nikko pics<br/>
Kyoto Pics<br/>
Miyajima Pics<br/>
<br/>
Kusunoki Masashige was the "loyal retainer" of Emperor<br/>
Go-Daigo, and the pics of him are from the statue<br/>
outside the Imperial Palace. Nikko is the final<br/>
resting place of Tokugawa Ieyasu and his grandson,<br/>
Iemitsu, the first and third Tokugawa Shoguns.<br/>
Kyoto...well, you know. Miyajima is the site of the<br/>
Itsukushima Shrine, and the site of the battle between<br/>

Dean, the "meaningless junk" you refer to is called "moji bake". <br/>
That's not bake like "bake a cake", it's bah-kay. It's happening <br/>
because either your encoding, or the encoding of the person who <br/>
sent the message (or both) are somehow not correct.<br/>
<br/>
If you can answer a few questions it would help get you closer to <br/>
your goal, I think:<br/>
1. What operating system are you using? That is, Windows 2000, Windows <br/>
98, Windows XP, etc.<br/>
2. Can you see Japanese at all on your computer? For instance Japanese <br/>
web pages? Japanese documents?<br/>
3. Are you able to see any Japanese at all on this mailing list? If <br/>
you could point to an email that you did see properly it will help.<br/>
4. Here is a test string of Japanese. Does it work? &#12356;&#12429;&#12399;&#12395;&#12411;&#12408;&#12392;&#12385;&#12426;<br/>

change his encoding. The next step is to enable the<br/>
Japanese fonts, but that's not necessary unless he<br/>
wants to write. <br/>

it's already in there, you just have to turn it on<br/>
throught the control panel. <br/>

 </span></blockquote>Okay, if you've got Windows XP, try this: <br/>
<br/>
When viewing the email with Japanese in it, left click<br/>
<br/>
and go to "Encoding" on the menu that pops up. Click<br/>
on it, and see if anything that says Japanese is on<br/>
there..."Japanese(AutoSelect)", "Japanese(ShiftJIS)",<br/>
or "Japanese(EUC)". These are all encoding systems<br/>
that read the characters on your screen. Switching to<br/>
them generally does not affect most English text. Half<br/>
the time I forget which encoding I'm in. <br/>
<br/>
If they aren't there, click "more". See if they are<br/>
there. If they are, click one--preferably Japanese<br/>
(AutoSelect). <br/>
<br/>
If they aren't on the "more" window, then you'll have<br/>
to go to your control panel. <br/>
<br/>
As I'm currently on a Win 2000 machine at work, I<br/>
can't help further for now--when I get home to my XP<br/>
machine, I'll hunt down what exactly you are supposed<br/>
to do there. But if you're running XP, it's already on<br/>
your machine to READ Japanese--you may or may not have<br/>
to load something to get to write Japanese, but you<br/>
should be able to download that--alternately, it's on<br/>
your windows startup disk. <br/>

with a menu. I then tried pasting Jay's email with its sample text in to<br/>
Outlook Express just in case it was an issue with Turnpike, again no<br/>
joy, however...<br/>
<br/>
I noticed that when Turnpike displayed Jay's message, it offered me the<br/>
option of selecting a different mode of "Viewer". The default option was<br/>
Internet Exploder, so off I went, and hey presto, a little line of<br/>
hiragana. I assume Jay that's what you actually sent me?<br/>
<br/>
Nate continued:<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> >    If they aren't on the "more" window, then you'll have<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>As the above solution is not totally ideal, I decided to go wandering<br/>
through the Control Panel, where I found Regional and Language options.<br/>
I attempted to set it up for Japanese. The files were already on my hard<br/>
drive (requested when I bought the machine), so I went into Advanced and<br/>
did the deed. I then had to undo it as some very strange things happened<br/>
to all my other programs. For example on the address bar of "My<br/>
Documents", the back slashes were replaced with the symbol for yen! Of<br/>
course this could be perfectly normal, but being a bit twitchy where<br/>
computing is concerned, I went in to reverse gear.<br/>
<br/>
Anyway, everything is now back to what passes for normal around here,<br/>
and with a stroke of a key I can read kana. Jay or Nate, could you send<br/>
me some kanji so I can confirm that the system can in fact cope.<br/>
<br/>
H'mm, now what about writing in Japanese..? Arghhh....:-)<br/>
<br/>
Cheers for all the help.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Okay, sounds like it worked. I don't remember what Jay<br/>
sent, though.<br/>
<br/>
I then had to undo it as some very<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>No, this is what you want. When that happens, just<br/>
change the encoding back to "western european" and it<br/>
will switch back. As to why no little sidebar menu<br/>
popped up, it may depend on "where" you are clicking.<br/>
Don't click on text you are typing--and make sure it's<br/>
a RIGHT click--I may have said left click, not<br/>
thinking. Now that I actually look at the mouse, it's<br/>
a right click. <br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I'll try when I get home--much to my chagrin, I can<br/>
read but can't type fonts yet on my work computer<br/>
here, and last night my home connection went down, so<br/>
we'll see. I should get the disk for the fonts (I'm on<br/>
a Win 2000 comp--cheap govt--and can't download it)<br/>
next week. <br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> > H'mm, now what about writing in Japanese..?<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Go back to the control panel; go to regional options,<br/>
and then Input Locales. Click "Change", then it will<br/>
take you to Text Services. Click "Add" and highlight<br/>
Japanese, then it should come up with a language bar<br/>
you can switch back and forth. <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-753069782">Hi Nate,<br/>
<br/>
I can get my machine to toggle between "English" and "Japanese" input on<br/>
the keyboard, but apart from doing that, nothing, even the menus that<br/>
hang off the language bar don't work! They flash up and disappear, I<br/>
suspect its a conflict of some sort, probably with the special text<br/>
enlarging and speech out package, that's what normally mucks everything<br/>
up on this machine.<br/>
<br/>
As I think I've taken up enough band width with this one for the time<br/>
being, I'm going to try to get some one in to look at my config, to see<br/>
if it can be sorted out. Meanwhile, back to things Japanese and<br/>

that you had replied to earlier, that you could<br/>
see--hence my confusion. So we've established one<br/>
fact--you can see the Japanese in the original email,<br/>
but not when it's rerouted as a reply. Hmm.<br/>
