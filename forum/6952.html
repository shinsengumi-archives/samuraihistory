<br/>
The site where the new capital was located was first settled in the <br/>
6th century by the Hata family, immigrants from Korea, whose members <br/>
were skilled in silkworm culture and silk weaving. <br/>
<br/>
Geographically the area consisted of a fault basin, framed on the <br/>
north, east and west by the Tamba Mountains. Two rivers, now known <br/>
as the Kamogawa and the Katsuragawa, flowed down from the mountains, <br/>
bisecting the basin before joining the Yodogawa (Yodo River), which <br/>
emptied into Osaka Bay.<br/>
<br/>
With the rivers providing easy access to the merchants and markets <br/>
of Osaka, The Hatas gradually amassed great wealth through commerce <br/>
in silk goods. Their success attracted the powerful Kamo, Izumo and <br/>
Ono families who built imposing residences in the northern districts <br/>
of the basin.<br/>
<br/>
The population of the basin and the wealth of the families living <br/>
there continued to grow. In the late 700s the reigning emperor and <br/>
his ministers decided to move the Imperial capital from nearby Nara <br/>
to the Kyoto basin. They chose to pattern the layout of the new <br/>
capital after the Tang dynasty Chinese capital of Chang'an (modern <br/>
Xi'an or Sian), which at that time was one of the largest and <br/>
grandest cities in the world. <br/>
<br/>
The new capital, christened Heiankyo (literally, Peace Capital), was <br/>
laid out in the shape of a rectangle, measuring 4.5 kilometers (2.8 <br/>
miles) from east to west, and 5.2 kilometers (3.2 miles) from north <br/>
to south. The emperor and his entourage moved to the new city in <br/>
794, beginning a golden age in Japan that later came to be known as <br/>
the Heian Jidai (Hay-ee-on Jee-die) or the Age of Peace.<br/>
<br/>
Leaders of the powerful Fujiwara and Taira clans, which vied for <br/>
control of the Imperial Court by providing Imperial consorts and <br/>
ministers, built their residences in the Shirakawa and Rokuhara <br/>
districts of central Kyoto. <br/>
<br/>
Other palatial residences and landscaped gardens proliferated. The <br/>
arts and crafts achieved new heights of sophistication. For the next <br/>
four centuries, Kyoto flourished as one of the brightest stars in <br/>
the civilized world. <br/>
<br/>
In 1185 clan leader Yoritomo Minamoto defeated his rivals in battle, <br/>
had himself named Shogun by the emperor, took complete control of <br/>
the country, and moved the administrative functions of the <br/>
government from Kyoto to Kamakura, a tiny seaside village 45 km (28 <br/>
mi.) southwest of present-day Tokyo. Although no longer the seat of <br/>
administrative power, Kyoto continued to play a major role in the <br/>
cultural life of the country.<br/>
<br/>
When the Kamakura government was replaced by the Muromachi Shogunate <br/>
in 1333, the administration of the country was returned to Kyoto. <br/>
One of the first things the new government did was to break the hold <br/>
that Buddhist organizations in Nara had on the building of new <br/>
temples, and sponsor the building of dozens of temples, many of them <br/>
huge complexes, within the new city and on the surrounding <br/>
mountains. <br/>
     <br/>
The Muromachi period ended in 1568 after a long civil war that <br/>
devastated much of the splendid capital. In 1590, Hideyoshi <br/>
Toyotomi, the winner in this new clan struggle, began a major <br/>
rebuilding program in Kyoto that included the beautiful Fushimi <br/>
Castle and the lavishly decorated Jurakudai Mansion.<br/>
<br/>
Ieyasu Tokugawa, Toyotomi's successor, who founded the Tokugawa <br/>
Shogunate in Edo (now Tokyo) in 1603, continued to support Kyoto as <br/>
the Imperial as well as the cultural capital of Japan. To <br/>
accommodate himself on his regular trips to the city, Ieyasu <br/>
commissioned the building of the famous Nijo Castle, which remains <br/>
today as one of Kyoto's great treasures.<br/>
     <br/>
The arts, crafts and commerce in general flourished in Kyoto during <br/>
the Tokugawa period, but after the Shogunate fell and the Emperor <br/>
was restored to power in 1868, the new central government moved the <br/>
Imperial Court to Tokyo, once again leaving Kyoto on the sidelines <br/>
of history.<br/>
     <br/>
But being shunted aside was to turn out to be a major advantage for <br/>
Kyoto as the new government in Tokyo led the rest of the country in <br/>
a rapid industrial revolution between 1870 and 1890. During these <br/>
two frenetic and subsequent decades, Kyoto remained very much like <br/>
it had been for generationsÂ—its castles, palaces, shrines, temples <br/>
and traditional homes and shops intact.<br/>
<br/>
At the beginning of the U.S.-Japan war in 1941, Kyoto's reputation <br/>
for its cultural and historical significance was such that American <br/>
scholars and others who were intimately familiar with the city <br/>
persuaded the U.S. government to put it off-limits to Allied bombers <br/>
during the conflict.<br/>
<br/>
Still today, despite its postwar industrialization, Kyoto has 202 of <br/>
the country's National Treasures (20 percent of the total) and 1,596 <br/>
of its Important Cultural Assets (15 percent of the total). <br/>
<br/>
Among these treasures from the past: Kyoto Imperial Palace, Nijo <br/>
Castle, Katsura Detached Palace, Shugakuin Detached Palace, Nishi <br/>
Honganji Temple, Higashi Honganji Temple, Kiyomizu Temple, Yasaka <br/>
Shrine, Heian Shrine, and the beautiful Kinkakuji (Temple of the <br/>
Golden Pavilion). <br/>
<br/>
In addition to these historical treasures, Kyoto has three of the <br/>
country's largest annual festivals (Gion, Heian and Aoi), along with <br/>
a number of other major annual and monthly events that, combined, <br/>
attract millions of visitors each year.<br/>
<br/>
Kyoto is also the birthplace of No, Kyogen and Kabuki, and is the <br/>
national center for Chado (the Tea Ceremony) and Ikebana (Flower <br/>
Arranging), two of Japan's most important cultural practices.<br/>
<br/>
While examples of Japan's traditional culture can be found in <br/>
abundance throughout the islands, Kyoto has retained its role as the <br/>
primary repository of the glories of old Japan, and no one can say <br/>
they have "done Japan" without a visit to the ancient capital. <br/>
