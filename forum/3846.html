the period in which the Emperor Meiji was restored as the head of state and <br/>
the caste system subsequently abolished (meaning there was no Shogun or <br/>
samurai caste)?<br/>

the bakufu-regime of the shogun was canceled by the<br/>
Emperor. The samurai instead still exist 1867 the<br/>
samurai lost there rights of wearing the daisho<br/>
(katana and wakizashi) and the rebellion of satsuma<br/>
where the last great resistence. After that the<br/>
samurai where nearly shadows of what they where before<br/>
