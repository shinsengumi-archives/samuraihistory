<h3>Akechi Hidemitsu and Onimusha</h3>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-635451337">Hey.<br/>
       Hidemitsu Samanosuke Akechi, hero from Onimusha: Warlords (the series <br/>
opener) came back in Onimusha: Demon Seige (a.k.a. Onimusha 3, and supposedly <br/>
the series closer).  Mitsuhide makes a brief appearance or two in this third <br/>
game and is mentioned in the first.  The BradyGames guide gives some actual <br/>
historical background in the character bios section, but not enough to recommend <br/>
it as a source.  In the games, though, Mitsuhide is referred to as Hidemitsu's <br/>
uncle, instead of his brother (and hey, weren't they *cousins*?).  As I've <br/>
said before, though, don't knock it: it's what got me interested in this age in <br/>
Japan's history.  Just my two senseless worth.  :-)  Take care.<br/>
