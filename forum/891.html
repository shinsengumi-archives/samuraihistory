<div id="ygrps-yiv-1368642894">Hi, my name is Angel.<br/>
I'm new to the group.<br/>
I need information about Yoshida Chuzeemon, a Samurai under Oishi Kuranosuke, from the famous 47 Retainers (1701).<br/>
Need to know where to look, for information in his person, what type of fencing style he was a master, since he was a very skilful swordsman.<br/>
Also any information in his sword made by Fujihara Yoshitake.<br/>
<br/>
Thank you!<br/>
<br/>
