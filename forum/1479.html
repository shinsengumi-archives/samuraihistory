<div id="ygrps-yiv-776830397">YO! Out there in SAMURAI WORLD? In Korea another dumb war, our unit <br/>
or at least some of us in a B.J.U.were trained and worked with two <br/>
Samurai in mind control and mental img. as we got to know each other <br/>
we learned these men for the last few 100years came from people who <br/>
were brought up from birth to do a job like most of us, they loved  <br/>
each other and ladys also could control there minds to sit in winter <br/>
cold water in nothing on but undergarments for an hour or more. They <br/>
were probably good fighting men in the close arts of killing. but <br/>
they were men like all of us no more no less do not make somthing out <br/>
of them they were not? Kind of tunnel vis. like a monk with out being <br/>
limited to a monk's life style.<br/>
 2003 WOW! the guy that lives with out a car prob. lives inner city i <br/>
have lot's on N.Y. friend's who have not had a car for 30 years do <br/>
you think a Samurai would not ride a horse because it poops on the <br/>
road? Or not get in a Jeep to go some were, or use some of our winter <br/>
gear when cold? You sound like the people that went back to mother <br/>
earth in the late 50 & 60 to live with out elec, grow, and kill there <br/>
own food i was there what a joke that was.Most lasted about 2to3 <br/>
weeks and a few 4to6months and back to MOM & DAD and $$$$.I work out <br/>
with some people that you might call 2003 Samurai they make a liveing <br/>
as body guards and teaching murk's. but when the go home they have a <br/>
comp, car, lights, and mybe a Big Mack WOW! You should do what my son <br/>
did when he was young, GO to CHINA and live at a monestery for a year <br/>
to learn healing with herbal healing and understaning life. OR for <br/>
the real SAMURAI out there go around the world as a pit fighter as <br/>
some of my friends have. [Live the good life with honor and careing  <br/>
and be true to your self we are not and can never be Samurai!  <br/>
Remember reading is not doing it's the problem in the U.S. to much <br/>
reading and liveing in ones mind, life is short go out and enjoy it.I <br/>
lived in Hong K.for 2 years in the 50's never saw any of the <br/>
Hollywood stuff that's out there.and very few have.In 50 Hong K. was <br/>
china today it's a shopping mall how sad.      Cheers Joseph</div>

Hi Andrea<br/>
<br/>
There are several excellent books and sources regarding legends. For a start try "The Nobility of Failure" - Ivan Morris: this work chronicles several personalities from the 4th - 20th centuries. Maybe even "Musashi" - Eiji Yoshikawa: An epic novel of the samurai era {so its blurb states..} Or even look at some of the Japanese Woodcuts, such as those of Kuniyoshi to find legend topics.<br/>
Good luck with the writing....<br/>
<br/>
