<h3>Bushido, Zen, Karate and Funakoshi etc</h3>
by <i>luke berryman</i>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1207020803">To all,<br/>
     Because of recent e-mails about the relationship between Bushido and Karate, I have decided to write an essay on this subject, using evidence from JKA masters as well as extracts from respected books. This is my final attempt to prove to you all there is such a strong link between the 2. I hope you all will then decide to do your own research to compliment this essay. Thank you very much.<br/>

<h3>another new topic</h3>
by <i>kentguy212002</i>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1579234694">Ok people another new topic. I was wondering if anyone has any ideas why there is a lack of defencive shield in japanese military history. Ive read that it maybe due to the samurai origins as a horseback archer and that they were not devloped because ,obviously thay would be in the way of drawing a bow. I also find it strange that in my kendo training there are no sword techniques like the lunge as seen in european fencing which is sometimes seen as a way past a shield, is this why the lunge techinque wasnt devloped in japan because there was no need for it due to a lack of shields. Anyone got any ideas ( i am aware there are lunging techniques in japanese swordplay but vastly different from european forms) thanks all hope your all good<br/>

<h3>Re: another new topic - the lunge</h3>
by <i>thomas_tessera</i>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-328180447">'Do' as opposed to 'jutsu' can be read to mean an emphasis on<br/>
aesthetic style than combat effectiveness, and a lunge is simply <br/>
not very aesthetically pleasing - it involves over-reaching and <br/>
thus grossly disturbs one's balance and equilibrium.<br/>
<br/>
Having said that, thrusts are employed in modern martial arts:<br/>
In kendo 'tsuki' is a thrust at the throat, and is, I believe, the<br/>
only thrust allowed within the rules of the sport.<br/>
<br/>
In armour, of course, it would be the most logical target, and kendo<br/>
assumes combat against someone in armour. The thrust in European <br/>
fencing is against an unarmoured oponent.<br/>
<br/>
In iaido/jutsu there are a number of thrusts - in fact Mae, the very<br/>
first technique in ZNKR iaido employs (albeit arguably), a thrust at<br/>
an opponent in the rear.<br/>
<br/>
Of the remaining 9, the following involve a thrust:<br/>
No4: Tsuka ate;<br/>
No6: Morote tsuki (one of my 'favourite five');<br/>
No8: Ganmen ate;<br/>
No9: Soete tsuki.<br/>
<br/>
The swordsman does not 'lunge' because it's something of a 'do or<br/>
die' attack - if it doesn't do the job, you're wide open to counter <br/>
attack - far more so than if you'd have stayed upright and moved <br/>
forward.<br/>
<br/>
Having said all that there is a lunge in Muso Shinden Ryu kodachi<br/>
which works on the principle that you'll most probably die, but take <br/>
the other guy with you.<br/>
<br/>
In Muso Shinden Ryu kenjutsu, there are lunges - in fact there are<br/>
what might be considered 'wild slashes' - which are set-up moves to <br/>
invite your opponent into making an attack.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Shotokan isn't the origins of karate. You are<br/>
completely missing that. Karate didn't begin with<br/>
Gichin Funakoshi. <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1221802170">It's still a valid question, one I have myself. <br/>
<br/>
As I understand it, Japanese warfare originally stressed a lot of <br/>
horse archery. This of course influenced the development of armor, <br/>
and yes, most Japanese weaponry is two-handed. But plenty of other <br/>
horse-mobile warrior cultures did use shields of one sort or another, <br/>
in addition to bows. <br/>
<br/>
In the case of the Japanese, shields are conspicuous in their <br/>
absence. With shield-using Korean and Chinese neighbors, it almost <br/>
seems like a rejection of shields. <br/>
