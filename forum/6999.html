<div id="ygrps-yiv-2049756977">Hi there everybody:<br/>
<br/>
I read the novel 'Memoirs of a Geisha' its fantastic. I wanted to do a <br/>
little more learning on the subject. Do any of you know of a good <br/>
website where I can find legit info. on the subject? How about books <br/>
are there any good ones on the subject too?<br/>

 </span></blockquote>I can't say much about websites, but there definately are many good<br/>
books on the subject.  Most books provide little more than an overview<br/>
of the subject and vary only in the quality of details and<br/>
illustrations/photos.  Of these types, my favorite is: 'Geisha: A<br/>
Unique World of Tradition, Elegance, and Art' by John Gallagher. <br/>
Admitedly, Gallagher's book provides little information that you<br/>
couldn't find in a dozen other books, but the photos and art work his<br/>
book provides are of a somewhat higher quality.  His book is the only<br/>
one I have ever found that offers illustrations on every layer of<br/>
clothing the Geisha wore.  If you search your local bookstore or surf<br/>
around Amazon.com, you will easily find a number books on the subject.<br/>
<br/>
The book I think you should start with, though, is: Geisha: A Life' by<br/>
Mineko Iwasaki.  This book is an autobiography of Mineko Iwasaki, the<br/>
woman Arthur Golden's main character was built around.  Her book<br/>
provides a very intimate look into the world of the Geisha.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>The academic bible in English is Liza Dalby's "Geisha;" Downer's "Women <br/>
of the Pleasure Quarters", is the closest you can get to a history book <br/>
- but she barely uses Japanese sources.<br/>
My favorites, however, are still Mineko Iwasaki and Sayo Masuda's <br/>
autobiographies - mind you, the first will shatter a few of Golden's <br/>
orientalist glitter.<br/>
<br/>
The best book, anyway is in Japanese:<br/>
Kyoto Geiko to Maiko no Okuzashiki, by Aihara Kyouko<br/>
This is easily found in Japan, costs only 700 yen and it's written in <br/>
very plain language. It covers history very well, and has chapters on <br/>
the arts, the various hanamachi, etc.<br/>
<br/>
If you are interested in the present condition of geisha in Kyoto, I <br/>
might be the one to talk to, as I have done research about it less than <br/>
two years ago, and I have a couple of geiko I became "friend" with. I <br/>
wrote a paper about it as well, with interviews and appendixes giving <br/>
probably the most updated date you can get in English.<br/>
