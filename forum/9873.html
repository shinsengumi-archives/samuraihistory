<div id="ygrps-yiv-1957499304">Depends on what  you're looking for.  Most of the time it's governed more by<br/>
the miniatures available, and less by the rules.<br/>
<br/>
For a system that covers a wide time frame, I'd check out DBM, and DBA.<br/>
It's an older system, and it's 15mm but they've got lists for Japanese of<br/>
different time frames in their last rules set I saw.   Old Glory had a<br/>
samurai line which I picked up some of, both in 15mm and 25mm.    Twin<br/>
Dragons has some very detailed 15mm mini's  but last I checked they were<br/>
backordered.  (that may have changed, been a long time since then)<br/>
<br/>
As for computer games, Shogun, Total war is one of the best games for the<br/>
Japanese genre that I've ever seen.    All of the others tend to be fantasy<br/>
based.<br/>
<br/>
For a fantasy version of samurai,  Clan War isn't bad, but it suffers again<br/>
from the Old Game syndrome, meaning most of the miniatures are no-longer in<br/>
production and fewer people are playing it.   The mini's are gorgeous<br/>
however, and are in 28mm.   It's tied very strongly to the Legend of the<br/>
Five Rings RPG.<br/>
<br/>
For a historical RPG,  I'd go for Sengoku.  Though it's got a fantasy<br/>
element to it, it's easily stripped out and it allows you to play the<br/>
chambara(sp) style genre fairly accurately.   Alot of actual historical<br/>
research went into that game, and I've found it to be a good down to earth<br/>
system to play in. If I remember correctly, Anthony Bryant? (I apologize if<br/>
I got his name wrong) one of the leading scholars on the time frame<br/>
contributed to it.  I believe his website to be sengokudaimyo.com<br/>
<br/>
All of that being said, if I'd have to recommend a wargame, and only one,<br/>
I'd go for Shogun: Total War.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1463862645">-This will be slightly off topic on your war-games question, but it is viable and related anyway I feel.<br/>
<br/>
So my game suggestion is Dynasty Tactics and Dynasty Tactics Two for the Playstation 2.  The sequel is better, and the setting is the Three Kingdoms period in China, but it is arguably a similar time period with the samurai in Japan.  The games is somewhat abstract, turn based, and involves armies lead by officers who convey special movements and tactics.  It is turn based and on tiles almost like a chessboard except with different terrains and fortresses and things. Armies are made up of units like archers, swordsmen, pike men, crossbows, catapults, cavalry, engineers, etc.  Also there are different goals like taking specific castles, capturing specific enemy officers, and more.<br/>
<br/>
These games are both very fun and easy to get into games, and both are probably very cheap on the web as they are older titles.<br/>
<br/>
Koei who publishes these games does make other samurai related video games, and I always wanted this type of game made with Samurai involved.<br/>
<br/>
I hope this helps.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1036471742">in regards to the reply about dynasty tactics. I believe there was a similar game by the same publisher entitled Kessen and Kessen 2 that are the period and country he is requesting.<br/>
<br/>
Also, Samurai Warriors Empires is a fun game, not quite as accurate, but still, entertaining.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-691099593">For boardgames (actually more like wargames or simulations), GMT's RAN and Samurai are the most accurate recreations of samurai warfare in English. There are more very accurate wargames produced in Japanese-more than I can write about here, but you can read about some of them on the Samurai Archives forum.<br/>
For computer games, the Takeda series by Magitech (with Takeda 3 having just been released) is far better than Shogun: Total War as far as accuracy of gameplay and simulating historical situations. Shogun: Total War (in my opinion) has far too many abstractions, ahistorical units, and unrealistic gameplay. Shogun, however, does tend to have a higher fun factor. The Takeda series is brutal and unforgiving in its depiction of warfare.</div>

Shogun: Total War and its follow on games [Shogun Total War: Warlord Edition] which include the Mongol Invasion and the era of the country at war. So you get to play the samurai generals who drove back the Mongols or up to the 16th century and play the warring daimyo to become Shogun!<br/>
<br/>
It is an awesome series available for the PC.<br/>
