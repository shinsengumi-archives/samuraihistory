There isnt an actual written code but it varys depending on the source as to what is in it, but its main points are loyalty to <br/>
ones lord above everything else even ones own family. And you must be ready to die on a moments notice. there are also<br/>
many sources that speak of keeping your armour and weapons in good repair and to practice your martial skills.<br/>

I would have to say that Hagakure is one of the best sources if you want to know the code and ethics of the Samurai. I have read it over at least 5 times and some of the stuff is very complicated, just because it is hard to understand. If anyone else has read Hagakure and has had this problem, please share what you find hard to understand because their is one such line that I cannot comprehend. "The master took a book from it's box. When he opened it there was the smell of drying clovebuds." I find that hard to understand, because that is the only thing in the passage.<br/>

It does a great job at showing the difference in today's society compared to how it was then, I think just about everything in Hagakure would be considered obscene in society today.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1760728323">Be aware that the first time that the ideas known to us as Bushido,<br/>
weren't written down formally until just after 1700, one hundred years<br/>
after the great civil wars had really ended, right in the middle of the<br/>
Edo era. The code was promoted by the Tokugawa shoguns, so as to turn<br/>
the now redundant samurai class in to administrators and warriors<br/>
(individual fighters) rather than soldiers (team players), to help<br/>
ensure continuing peace. This policy was so effective that after the<br/>
dreadful performance of the samurai in their attempts to put down the<br/>
Shinabara rebellion of mainly farmers in 1638, the planned invasion of<br/>
the Philippines was cancelled and the country completely sealed. So when<br/>
reading anything on Bushido, keep in mind its political purpose.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Indeed! An even at that time the written down codes were more of<br/>
certain persons oppinions than concensus of how all the members of the<br/>
bushi class thought. In Hakagure for example Tsunetomo critisizes the<br/>
47 rônin, who usually are considered the shining examples of bushidô.<br/>
Hagakure also didn't seem to be widely read during the time of it's<br/>
writing, but was mostly used during the earlier part of 1900s, several<br/>
decades after the "samurai" ceased to exist, to promote "yamato<br/>
damashii" and was very popular with the right wing politicians and the<br/>
military.<br/>
I like Hakagure very much. For me it gives an interesting window to<br/>
certain period in Japanese history through one persons eyes. The best<br/>
thing for me that it has to offer are the "news" (more like rumours)<br/>
that were circulating around and that Tsunetomo wrote down.<br/>
<br/>
Well enough of ranting from me... there are more knowledgeable people<br/>
who have written on the subject:<br/>

  The list of virtues that I have always been aware of are as follows:<br/>

Chuugi - Loyalty<br/>
Makoto - Honesty<br/>
Meiyo - Honor<br/>

Yuu - Valor<br/>

  I am rather certain that there are no more than 7 virtues, mostly because <br/>
the 7 pleats in the traditional hakama are meant to represent these virtues.<br/>
  I hope that this has helped in some way.<br/>

used prior to the 17th century or not, anyone here knows?<br/>

<h3>Re: Bushido</h3>
by <i>shogunmasami</i>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1591028011">BU -Military or combat <br/>
<br/>
SHI -Knight or warrior <br/>
<br/>
DO -Way or path <br/>
<br/>
Bushido then literally means Military - Knight - Way or more <br/>
commonly referred to as the "Way of the warrior". <br/>
<br/>
Bushido originated in its elementary from at the time of the Yamato <br/>
period (400-645) the oldest truly Japanese society- was an <br/>
unwritten, tact code of behaviour held in the minds and hearts of <br/>
the military class. In the closing years of the Heian period (794-<br/>
1185) it evolved into an expression of the morality and spirit of <br/>
the classical warrior. At this time Bushido was known by the term <br/>
Kyuba-No-Michi or way of the horse and bow. In the Kokon Chomonshu <br/>
(a study concerning the Heian period) there are mentioned "seven <br/>
Cardinal Virtues" of the very simple kind of moral consciousness <br/>
developed among those fighting men of ancient times. Briefly stated, <br/>
the seven virtues urged the warrior to shun violence, to keep his <br/>
sword sheathed, and to live in peace and amity with his fellow men. <br/>
Later during the Kamakura period (1185-1333) Yoritomo's Bakufu (the <br/>
first military government) demanded that Loyalty be the supreme <br/>
virtue especially to Yoritomo the shogun himself. During the <br/>
following century the country was constant turmoil from the civil <br/>
wars. The warrior's knights whose duty it was to fight, must have <br/>
felt keenly the uncertainty of life. For such an attitude is clearly <br/>
reflected in the way in which he regards the ethics of his <br/>
privileged class, which were now permeated by a Zen flavour. This <br/>
gave a trust in fate, a quite submission to the inevitable, that <br/>
nonchalant composure in sight of danger or calamity, that distain <br/>
for life and friendliness with death. <br/>
<br/>
In the 1603 the Tokugawa Bakufu appeared, it heralded a period of <br/>
prolonged peace spanning practically to the 20th century Bushido <br/>
needed to evolve at this time to fit in this new type of warrior <br/>
knight who was no longer constantly engaged in warfare. Bushido <br/>
acquired a complex, highly idealistic from and the major doctrines <br/>
of the code were committed to writing during this period in many <br/>
famous works. <br/>
 <br/>
The main tents were: <br/>
<br/>
LOYALTY- absolute, both to ones lord and master and in the <br/>
performance of duty. <br/>
<br/>
RECTITUDE- In the word of a well-known Samurai "rectitude is the <br/>
power of deciding upon a certain course of conduct in accordance <br/>
with reason, without wavering; - to die when it's right to die, to <br/>
strike when to strike is right". <br/>
<br/>
COURAGE- doing what is morally right with no thought of losing. <br/>
<br/>
BENEVOLENCE- mercy, respect, love understanding, tenderness, pity. <br/>
<br/>
POLITENESS- not simply to show good taste, but a sympathetic regard <br/>
for the feelings of others, and respect to social positions. <br/>
<br/>
FILIAL PIETY- not only that absolute devotion to the parents but to <br/>
the family line. Others tents that feature strongly in the code are <br/>
Veracity, Sincerity, Honesty, Propriety, Valour, Righteousness, <br/>
Honour and Self-control.<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
The code of Bushido is represented in the seven folds of the Hakama <br/>
(5 at the front and 2 at the rear) and their meanings are: <br/>
<br/>
1. YUKI Courage, Valour, Bravery. <br/>
<br/>
2. JIN Humanity, Charity, Benevolence.<br/>
<br/>
3. GI Justice, Righteousness, Integrity.<br/>
<br/>
4. REI Etiquette, Courtesy, Civility. <br/>
<br/>
5. MAKOTO Sincerity, Honesty, Reality. <br/>
<br/>
6. CHUDGI Loyalty, Fidelity, Devotion. <br/>
<br/>
7. MEIYO Honour, Credit, Glory, Reputation, Dignity. <br/>

<h3>RE: [samuraihistory] Bushido</h3>
by <i>keecurlee</i>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1490662155">I  would like to find out where I could find the old art of samurai painting<br/>
or the paintings of the samurai. I have started buying or trying to buy<br/>
Katana swords. I have looked up all I could find around here. (I have to<br/>
drive 25 miles to the library to find out that they don't carry that sort of<br/>
reading) I have started trying to buy books on the subject of the katana and<br/>
came up with The Book of Five Rings, By Miyamoto Musashi, This was a very<br/>
good book! Now Can anybody lead me to more about my swords? Like the 47<br/>
Ronin, These things I know nothing about... Thank You     Kee Curlee<br/>

<h3>[samuraihistory] Saito/Tokugawa alliance.</h3>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>First off: No problem if people want to reply to an<br/>
email and introduce a new thread--much easier than<br/>
going through the website. PLEASE change the subject<br/>
heading at the top though. This question is NOT abut<br/>
Bushido or kanji characters--help us help you, by<br/>
properly identifying it. <br/>
<br/>
Secondly: You'll get better response if you clarify<br/>
what, who, and when you are talking about. To Mr.<br/>
Rogers--There were about a dozen different Saito<br/>
families at various different times, not necessarily<br/>
related. When are you talking about? If you mean<br/>
around 1561 or so, I'd assume you meant the Saito of<br/>
Mino, and were asking if they had an alliance with the<br/>
Matsudaira (later Tokugawa) of Mikawa. If you mean<br/>
later than that (for you obviously can't mean before<br/>
that), then I'm not entirely sure which Saito clan you<br/>
may mean, or what type of alliance you'd be asking<br/>
about. Post 1600 it wouldn't be an alliance--it'd be<br/>
the Tokugawa telling the Saito to do something, if<br/>
they knew what was good for them. <br/>
<br/>
To Mr./Ms. Vahabi: I don't wish to be offensive, but<br/>
the utter vagueness of your response leads me to<br/>
believe it's a random thought with no back-up. A<br/>
rebellion in the north? When was this? Was it in the<br/>
Tohoku region? Who was this Saito clan which "allied"<br/>
with the Tokugawa (not the Tukugawa, mind you)?<br/>
Please, provide some hard facts---though admittedly,<br/>
your answer is only as vague as the question. <br/>
<br/>
To all: While digressions are acceptable to an extent,<br/>
and we've been known to pass our fair share of jokes<br/>
and inane banter, it's been brought up by several<br/>
people that we need to get back to some serious<br/>
HISTORY discussion. This question provides and<br/>
excellent opportunity to DO just that, as long as we<br/>
can define the question better. It's certainly better<br/>
than bushido kanji--does NO ONE know how to look up<br/>
online Japanese dictionaries?<br/>

I was wondering if anyone knew where I could find a website that would have<br/>
pictures of the kanji characters for the seven principles of Bushido. The<br/>
seven principles are:Gi, Rei, Yu, Meiyo, Jin, Makoto, and Chu. My goal is to<br/>
get all seven characters on the same sheet of paper. Any help would be<br/>
greatly appreciated. Thank You.<br/>

His adopted son was Yoshitatsu, who rebelled against him.<br/>
He also had three natural sons. They were Magoshirou (&#23403;&#22235;&#37070;), Nagatatsu (長龍),<br/>
and Kiheiji (&#21916;&#24179;&#27425;). Magoshirou and Kiheiji were younger than Yoshitatsu, and<br/>
he killed them. Nagatatsu died with Nobunaga's son at Nijo in Kyoto during<br/>
Mitsuhide's Honnoji attack.<br/>
He had at least one daughter; his daughter (name unclear) married Nobunaga.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>This time you beat ME to it. Please, people--change<br/>
the thread name if you change the subject. Here's why:<br/>
some people here are only interested in certain<br/>
subjects. If person A is an expert on Saito Dosan and<br/>
knows everything about him, but has no interest in<br/>
Kawanakajima, he may not even open the email asking<br/>
about Dosan's kids since he doesn't know what it's<br/>
about. Clarity is the key to getting the answers you<br/>
seek.<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Wasn't his daughter's name Kitsuno? That was<br/>
Nobunaga's wife's name. <br/>
