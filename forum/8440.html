   No. I see "ika" written in katakana much more often than in hiragana, <br/>
though both (and kanji, for that matter) are possible. Japanese has <br/>
tendencies and preferences (one of which is the use of katakana for <br/>
animals and plants) in terms of which script is most often used to write <br/>
certain words, but few strict rules; which script gets used often <br/>
depends partly on the context the word is used in, and partly on the <br/>
writer's preference.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>That's not true at all, judging by what I see in the<br/>
seafood section of my grocery store, and the sushiya I<br/>
go to regularly. Both write ika in katakana usually.<br/>
<br/>
What Hirai says is "generally" correct, katakana is<br/>
usually reserved for words originating outside of the<br/>
Japanese language in modern usage. However, this isn't<br/>
a hard and fast rule by any means, and frequently in<br/>
advertising, price tags, signs, etc. you will see<br/>
things written in kanji, hiragana, katakana, and<br/>
romaji with no rhyme or reason. There's nothing wrong<br/>
with writing Ika in katakana as opposed to hiragana. I<br/>
suppose you could use the kanji, too, though I think<br/>
even most Japanese would be surprised to see it. If<br/>
you were writing in a letter to your aunt that you ate<br/>
some fine yari-ika at the local sushiya, you'd likely<br/>
use hiragana; however, there's no requirement for you<br/>
to do so. <br/>
<br/>
Funnily enough, the sushiya I go to usually has the<br/>
specials up on the blackboard. Being katakana impaired<br/>
like I am (I simply DESPISE it), I spent 10 minutes<br/>
trying to figure out what "kashio" was...until it<br/>
dawned on me that one of the specials was hon-katsuo.<br/>

a particular poster, I suggest you either address that<br/>

Kitsuno). The post to which you replied doesn't seem<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Again, I'm not sure what you're taking issue with--the<br/>
post to which you replied simply contradicted what you<br/>
said, which others (myself included) have also done.<br/>
I'm not sure why you're getting defensive.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Personally, both are easy. However, I've determined<br/>
I've got some rare form of dyslexia which only<br/>
manifests itself when I'm forced to tell the diffence<br/>
between the "tsu", "shi", "so", and "n" in katakana.<br/>
For whatever reason, my brain goes into some sort of<br/>
"katakana brain freeze" when I'm confronted with a<br/>
word I'm not used to seeing in katakana/unfamiliar<br/>
with. For instance, if I see "ありがとう" (Arigatou)<br/>
in hiragana, I just read it, as easily as an English<br/>
word, since it's normally written in hiragana and I<br/>
recognize it. It's just like you don't have to sound<br/>
out "th-a-n-k...y-ou" when you read it. However if I<br/>
see it in katakana: AリガgE, my brain locks up, and<br/>
I have to sound it out. <br/>
<br/>
This is likely just a personal issue--my wife says I'm<br/>
katakana challenged. <br/>

foreign words in japanese. Memorize koohii and erebeta, it's easier." Then <br/>
you get to Japan. Japanese are honorable people but they don't play by the <br/>
rules. ;)<br/>

Does that make us somehow unworthy of comment<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Who are you referring to? If you've got a problem with<br/>
a particular poster, I suggest you either address that<br/>
person or bring it up with the moderators (myself or<br/>
Kitsuno). The post to which you replied doesn't seem<br/>
nasty or belittling to me at all--methinks you're<br/>
being a little too sensitive. <br/>
<br/>
To that end I would say this,<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> > "Serve the group and <br/>
> not one's self interest of greatness, for all will<br/>
> be the better for <br/>
> it."<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Again, I'm not sure what you're taking issue with--the<br/>
post to which you replied simply contradicted what you<br/>
said, which others (myself included) have also done.<br/>
I'm not sure why you're getting defensive.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>As the moderator and owner, let it be known right now that I don't<br/>
care about "feelings". Anyone who wants warm fuzzies and emotional<br/>
coddling can feel free to join this group:<br/>
<br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://tv.groups.yahoo.com/group/oprah/">http://tv.groups.yahoo.com/group/oprah/</a><br/>
<br/>
As far as I can tell, there are a few things at work here on this<br/>
list. First, the people who have been here the longest and still post<br/>
frequently all have known eachother for a few years now. Some of us<br/>
have even met in real life. Since we are the "in" crowd (being<br/>
moderators and/or people who are in with the moderator crowd) we tend<br/>
to not feel the need to "self-edit" our posts for the emotional<br/>
security of others. We play rough. Another thing at play here is that<br/>
most of the oldbies here are 1. guys, 2. guys who don't particularly<br/>
worry about offending others, and 3. Quite independent, fairly<br/>
cynical, and don't mince words.  Some people take this as being<br/>
insulting or being an outright attack on them. It isn't.  We are a<br/>
sarcastic bunch, but a pretty cool group once you get to know us,<br/>
unless you are the sensitive type that feels that sarcasm is always<br/>
mean and nasty. Don't expect us to put on velvet kid gloves when we<br/>
post. I can't type with gloves anyway. <br/>
<br/>
Remember rule #4, which should have been read when anyone joins the list:<br/>
<br/>
4. Have a thick skin and do not take things<br/>
personally. While we won't allow personal insults, you<br/>
must be able to handle being told you are wrong,<br/>
especially if you are wrong. No one on this email list<br/>
is infallible. Similarly, you must be able to handle<br/>
sarcasm. The moderators will not protect you if you<br/>
whine. The easiest thing to do is just not take things<br/>
personally. If you post a theory that does not fit with <br/>
what is commonly known and accepted as history, <br/>
then back up your ideas with sources OR face the wrath <br/>
of the more knowledgeable. Save your tears.<br/>
<br/>
Some people may be insulted by this post and leave. Oh well. Don't let<br/>
 the door hit you on the way out, or strain your finger clicking the<br/>
'leave this group' button, or whatever. For the rest of you who aren't<br/>
too sensitive to the written word, keep on posting, keep on asking<br/>
questions, and keep in mind that sarcasm is just because it is funny,<br/>
it isn't an attack, and a lot of the time, you may think you are being<br/>
attacked when all it is is just a straight answer. People here don't<br/>
tend to wrap the truth in a warm silk blanket, with perfume and roses.<br/>
Sometimes we hit bludgeon you with it. I understand that some people<br/>
are touchy feely, and I have to put up with that in the real world.<br/>
But this isn't the real world, this is MY world. That's what us<br/>
in-group people have the perrogative to do. Consider it some minor<br/>
hazing in order to get into the fraternity (although there are women<br/>
too). I am not PC, and I could give a rat's ass about being PC. Put up<br/>
with the hazing long enough, and you might find you accidentaly<br/>
learned something. And after a while, you too may end up in the in<br/>
crowd, and sit with us at the cool table in the cafeteria.<br/>
You have been warned, fortunately or unfortunately (depending on your<br/>
level of moral indignation) this is the way this place is run, so if<br/>
you can handle it, you are super kewl. If not, Ted Nugent is<br/>
dissapointed in you. And maybe I am too.<br/>
<br/>
And, for the record: I have only banned one person EVER for being<br/>
combatitive, and that was because they were emotionaly erratic.<br/>
<br/>
And maybe most importantly, don't forget who you are dealing with:<br/>

I recently saw a TV program that Ieyasu was able to take power because of <br/>

Adams had introduced the flintlock. Can someone set me straight please?<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Nope. The flintlock was introduced in Europe around<br/>
1630 <br/>
<br/>
From Wiki (though I hate to use them):<br/>
<br/>
""Flintlock" is the general term for any firearm based<br/>
on the flintlock mechanism. The type is now obsolete.<br/>
Introduced about 1630, it rapidly replaced earlier<br/>
types, such as the matchlock and wheellock, and<br/>
continued in common use for over two centuries,<br/>
replaced by cap and cartridge-based systems. The last<br/>
major use of flintlocks in the Americas occurred in<br/>
the first years of the American Civil War; however, a<br/>
few guns of this type are still manufactured for black<br/>
powder enthusiasts."<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
I've read that some of the cannon from the ship Adams<br/>
arrived on were used at Sekigahara, but I don't recall<br/>
if this is myth or fact. However, I've never heard of<br/>
them being a decisive factor in any way. No other guns<br/>
from the ship would have made a difference, as the<br/>
Japanese had plenty themselves already. <br/>
<br/>
Tony, any more info on the cannon, Mr. Sekigahara?<br/>

 </span></blockquote>First of all, that TV program sounds like it was getting its<br/>
history from James Clavell's Shogun. That is a bad thing. <G><br/>
<br/>
By 1600, there were thousands of matchlocks in use in Japan.<br/>
Adams ship probably didn't have more than a few dozen.<br/>
<br/>
Secondarily, the flintlock was not introduced until sometime<br/>
around 1625-30. That's basic research that looking at any<br/>
encyclopedia article will show.<br/>

<br/>
That brings up a point--I was watching something<br/>
(maybe an old episode of Hideyoshi, I can't remember)<br/>
and one character refers to his mother as what sounds<br/>
like "Haha-goze"....am I simply hearing a "Haha-ue"<br/>
wrong, or is there something else out there, like a "Haha-gozen"?<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1725209645">"Thanks, pretty much as I thought really. Can anyone expand on the cannon theory though? Sounds interesting."<br/>
<br/>
I had looked into this several months ago (the use or lack thereof of Tokugawa cannon at Sekigahara).<br/>
The Governor-general of Nagasaki (who was also in charge of Kioesjoe, where Adam's ship De Liefde landed) sent a Jesuit to inspect and inventory the ship. Among other things, they found 500 muskets and 19 (or 18, depending on the account) bronze guns (cannons). Ieyasu took the guns and cannon after his third interview with Adams. A later Jesuit account states that it was the 19 guns that provided the margin of victory at Sekigahara. However, none of Adam's letters mention the cannon being used and (aside from a short mention in one of Tony's Osprey samurai books) this was the only mention of the Tokugawa forces using cannon at Sekigahara I could find (although it's well documented that Ishida used several).

   <br/>
  "The firearms were called teppo and weapons under this general name were classified not by the calibre but by the weight of the shot fired, which ranged from about half an ounce to four ounces.  Cannon at the time were not efficient. The fired shot of not more than two or three pounds, their range was short and they were unreliable. After Sekigahara guns were obtained from the English and Dutch traders and used to good effect at Osaka castle. (Appendix III p 413)<br/>

like give us a title of the movie, or director, or<br/>
something. Telling us you've seen a movie about<br/>
samurai with Japanese people in it (which is what<br/>
"Nihonjin" means) and then asking us what we thought<br/>
is like a Japanese person saying "I saw a Hollywood<br/>
person with white people in it. What did you think of<br/>
the movie?"<br/>
<br/>
In other words, we need the title of the movie to<br/>
answer your question. <br/>

 </span></blockquote>Although this is what people are taught, it is not actually true. <br/>
Katakana is used for words and speech which feels alien. For example <br/>
Doraimon and Arale-chan speak in hiragana while more mechanical looking <br/>
robots speak in katakana. Similarly, tabako is gairaigo ultimately <br/>
coming from North America but is written in hiragana. While on-yomi <br/>
readings are given in katakana in kanwajiten, on-yomi compounds such as <br/>
denwa are much more likely to be written in hiragana when they are not <br/>
written in kanji.</div>

playing with hiragana blocks or more traditionally playing irohagaruta. <br/>
Katakana is more upright while hiragana is derived from sosho (grass <br/>

katakana. It is easier to read.</div>

 </span></blockquote>Barbara, hi--<br/>
<br/>
Wow, this is a bit of an old thread--it just dawned on<br/>
me that you were replying to me. Yes, I know I'm not<br/>
actually dyslexic--it was a bit tongue in cheek. My<br/>
wife actually does have mild dyslexia, so it certainly<br/>
wasn't meant to be insensitive (funnily enough, she<br/>
kicks my butt at reading/using katakana). <br/>
<br/>
After 12 years of studying Japanese and living off and<br/>
on in Japan, I'm well aware of the differences between<br/>
the characters that you point out above. It's not a<br/>
lack of knowledge--hence why I describe it as a<br/>
"dyslexia". Sometimes my brain simply doesn't compute<br/>
the katakana word I'm looking at, even though I'd see<br/>
the same thing in hiragana and not miss a beat. For<br/>
instance, even though I've seen the word ･｢･�･ﾐ･､･ﾈ<br/>
1000 times since my Japanese 121 class 12 years ago,<br/>
it's entirely possible that 10% of the time I'd simply<br/>
blank when looking at it. More common, however, is<br/>
frustration when seeing a word I use daily in hiragana<br/>
or kanji, but spending a full minute to figure it out<br/>
because someone wrote it in katakana. Even though I<br/>
used to live within a 2 minute walk of it, if I<br/>
saw｡｡･隘隘ｮ･ｳ･ｦ･ｨ･�｡｡on a sign, it'd take me forever<br/>
to figure out it was the ﾂ蝪ｹﾌﾚｸ�ｱ� next to｡｡ﾌﾀｼ｣ｿﾀｵﾜ<br/>
where I used to walk my dogs. <br/>
<br/>
To use an example in English--I don't have to sound<br/>
out "C-e-n-t-r-a-l P-a-r-k" to get a famous park in<br/>
New York--I just read the words "Central" and "Park".<br/>
Similarly, I don't have to stop and sound out<br/>
"､隍隍ｮ､ｳ､ｦ､ｨ､�｡ﾉor "ﾂ蝪ｹﾌﾚｸ�ｱ�", but I do have to<br/>
stop with ･隘隘ｮ･ｳ･ｦ･ｨ･�. As I said, it's not an issue<br/>
of being unfamiliar with the katakana characters--I<br/>
use them daily. I simply have some sort of "block"<br/>
with katakana, especially when I see a word I don't<br/>
immediately recognize. <br/>
<br/>
And my wife laughs at me all the time for it. <br/>
