<h3>Seppuku vs. Hara-Kiri</h3>
by <i>scorpialuna</i>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-967097167">Hey guys,<br/>
<br/>
My husband's Japanese, and I asked him about the difference. He <br/>
says, "Hara-Kiri is what you do to a fish, seppuku is what a man does <br/>
to himself." While poetic, I thought perhaps he was joking, but he <br/>
insists calling ritual suicide 'hara-kiri' is a Western <br/>
misunderstanding. According to him, the proper term is seppuku.<br/>
<br/>
I also thought that the reason for tying the belt around the legs was <br/>
so that the body would fall forward, since it was considered <br/>
undignified for a bushi to fall backwards. Also, to fall forward and <br/>
put the head down is a much more efficient position for the second to <br/>
cut (or so it would seem.)<br/>
<br/>
Can anyone tell me whether the practice of cutting the neck so as to <br/>
leave a thin string of tissue between the body and the head (to <br/>
differentiate the body of a man who committed seppuku from a fallen <br/>
enemy whose head was taken) was ever extant? I've read of it in a few <br/>
books, but have not seen any scholarly verification.<br/>

Unfortunately (or fortunately) being a native speaker doesn't mean <br/>
that you automatically know everything about your language. I know <br/>
that is certainly the case for me and English.<br/>
<br/>
Harakiri is a perfectly legitimate (and old) word referring to ritual <br/>
suicide. Of course it is a bit crude, which may be where your husband <br/>
is coming from in saying that it's better to use the word to refer to <br/>
animals. But it can't be denied that hara-kiri is perfectly natural <br/>
and not a Western misunderstanding. For instance there is the <br/>
"Nagamachi Onna Harakiri" &#38263;&#30010;&#22899;&#33145;&#20999; from 1712, but I'm sure that <br/>
others can give you even earlier references (I can't think of a <br/>
specific earlier title right now, unfortunately).<br/>

 </span></blockquote>I personally have never heard of this. From a practical point of view <br/>
it seems like it would be next to impossible to carry off. Plus it <br/>
seems like it's confusing things a bit. If this is the seppuku done <br/>
on the battlefield, it's not always clear that there would be a <br/>
kaishaku-nin there to cut off the head. If it is the more formal <br/>
seppuku ceremony, then of course there would be no need to make such <br/>
a distinction -- and in fact the head viewing ceremony took place <br/>
at a relatively far distance from the body.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>The thought that came to mind immediately upon reading<br/>
this is the Japanese habit of subjective translation.<br/>
All of you students of the language must have at one<br/>
time or another asked for the word for certain<br/>
subjects, let's call them "naughty" words or whatever,<br/>
only to be told that the Japanese "don't have those<br/>
kinds of words", or that various anatomical parts are<br/>
referred to as "asoko", "over there" or "that place",<br/>
rather than having a specific slang word for male or<br/>
female distinctive parts. Or that there aren't<br/>
equivalent expressions to the English "F you", etc. <br/>
<br/>
Well, spend 6 months in Japan and you learn that there<br/>
certainly ARE words for "naughty bits" or ways to<br/>
express the "F you" phrase. In the interest of keeping<br/>
this a family site, we won't go into it--it's not<br/>
important to the subject. But your comments to Lilith<br/>
made me think that perhaps it's a situation of the<br/>
native speaker telling you the way you SHOULD say<br/>
things, instead of the way they MAY be said. <br/>
<br/>
I also think that you could extrapolate that<br/>
"hara-kiri" means cutting a belly, whether it be a<br/>
man's belly, a fish's belly, a porkbelly, etc.<br/>
"Seppuku" is specifically and only the act of killing<br/>
yourself by cutting open your stomach. That's probably<br/>
supported by the fact that the word for suicide,<br/>
"Jisatsu", is different than seppuku.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Your sensei's confused--they are in fact the same<br/>
thing. And sure, there are plenty of other ways to<br/>
kill yourself. Miura Yoshimoto supposedly cut off his<br/>
own head when the Hojo defeated his forces in the<br/>
early 16th century. <br/>

  Well put.  It is easy to fall into the trappings of romanticism with <br/>
something like seppuku.  The seppuku I described was, as taught to be, the <br/>
way it would be done given the best possible situation.  High ranking <br/>
official given the opportunity to have a kaishaku.<br/>
  I would love to discuss the philosophy (or lack thereof) in seppuku with <br/>
you if you feel up to it.<br/>
<br/>
Lillith,<br/>
<br/>
  The only time I have ever heard of leaving the small piece of tissue is so <br/>
that, once the head has flopped over, it can be cut and the head will fall <br/>
into the lap of the one committing seppuku making for a very "clean" and <br/>
orderly seppuku.<br/>
<br/>

	I have heard of this also however can't remember where, I <br/>
believe this to be the formal method of performing seppuku. Also <br/>
anyone whom have done any form a martial arts will be able to tell <br/>
you this is no easy task, however with practice and dedication is not <br/>
impossible to carry off. Actually when first starting to learn <br/>
martial arts one of the first things you are taught is self control. <br/>
We are drilled again and again to perfect our control and when <br/>
entering the higher grades we are expected to have that perfect <br/>
control. At this stage we are no longer stoping our punches or kicks <br/>
inches away from the punching bag but instead we are stoping our <br/>
punches and kicks half and inch away from classmates faces. What I am <br/>
trying to say is if we could have that kind of control now then image <br/>
what they could do back then when there whole life where dedicated to <br/>
the art.</div>

Well, I'm always up for a conversation where I'm bound to learn <br/>
something. :) I just feel like this subject is dangerous water to get <br/>
into, especially on a mailing list where noone actually knows each <br/>
other. People have these preconceived notions that they've learned <br/>
from so many various sources (academics, movies, novels, martial arts <br/>
teachers, etc.) that it always seems like a conversation that is bound <br/>
to explode.<br/>
<br/>
And that in fact is one of my own points - the 'meaning of seppuku' <br/>
is so widely talked about and sometimes blithely thrown about that I <br/>
think people tend to lose sight of the actual history, physics, <br/>
biology, etc. of the thing. That's where I am coming from on this <br/>
discussion.<br/>
<br/>
But if we both promise to be gentlemen (I'm not sure if I can uphold <br/>
my partof the promise. :) ) I'd enjoy a serious and honest <br/>
discussion on the matter, for sure.<br/>
<br/>
So -- how to kick the conversation off?<br/>

  As for a starting point, how about this...What kind of importance would <br/>
you place on the kaishaku (second)?  Do you think that a kaishaku is <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-836206894">Keeping in mind what has been said about the differences between <br/>
Seppuku and jisatsu; I think of Seppuku as a battlefield solution to <br/>
tough situations. As in the Hojo commiting seppuku en masse at the <br/>
battle of Kamakura, to avoid capture, and humiliation. Or for say the <br/>
failure to complete your mission, saying to your lord and all your <br/>
comrades you gave your utmost (literally).<br/>
	So in my mind anyway the presence or addition of a Kaishaku was as the <br/>
name in english implies "Second-ary", the act is one you do by yourself <br/>
to preserve your or your families position, status, face, honour if you <br/>
like. The Kaishaku when present helped to make things a bit neater and <br/>
certainly less painful for the man in the hot seat but Seppuku was no <br/>
less impressive, effective and honourable without him...<br/>

Part of keeping the ceremony neat is avoiding unsightly things like <br/>
heads rolling across the floor. (There I said it, I apologize for <br/>
opening the can of worms, the gorefest begins with me I guess). When <br/>
one suddenly separates a human head from a human body there is a great <br/>
deal of blood pressure to be released, if you cut the head off <br/>
completely it is likely to fly across the room, spattered in blood and <br/>
roll to the foot of the witnesses. Hardly what I would report to my <br/>
superiors as a "tidy" end.<br/>
	If one were performing executions then there were deep pits and lots <br/>
of sand provided and there was no compunction about removing heads <br/>
completely, afterall these are criminals. The reason Kaishaku is <br/>
performed with a single-hand stroke is because we want to leave just so <br/>
much skin on the front side of the throat so that the head will simply <br/>
"fold" onto the chest (into the lap).<br/>
	I suggest you try tameshigiri with the target inclined 45 degrees or <br/>
so, with very little practice I think you'll find that the one handed <br/>
cut as taught in Eishin Ryu naturally allows you to leave just one or <br/>
two layers of the goza uncut and the target will simply fold over. <br/>
There really is no need in this case for any additional cut.<br/>

I think I am kind of where Tom is. In other words, my answer is <br/>
basically "it depends". Seppuku was done in diferent <br/>
ways, for different reasons, over a long period of time. You have <br/>
the death penalty, the following one's lord into death, the atoning <br/>
for mistakes/failures, the protest, the ultimate solution on the <br/>
battle field, and surely others that I can't think of just now.<br/>
<br/>
So, it really depends on the specifics. Or, another way to say it is - <br/>
no I don't see a kaishaku as being mandatory in all cases.<br/>
<br/>
If you are talking about seppuku as death penalty, in the more <br/>
crystalized and formalized later ceremony, then yes it was necessary. <br/>
Saying it even more strongly, you couldn't have had a 'seppuku' <br/>
without it, since in later cases (as we've discussed) the 'seppuku' <br/>
was being performed with a fan or a shinai.<br/>
<br/>
If we are talking about seppuku as dying at one's own hands rather <br/>
than at the hands of one's enemies, a la Nobunaga, then no a <br/>
kaishaku was not necessary, even if it were possible to round one up.<br/>
<br/>
What do you think?<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1729725738">The principle importance of the kaishaku is that he can perform <br/>
his task without hesitation - and provision must be made in the <br/>
case of the seppukee (is that allowable?) loses his nerve at <br/>
the last minute...!<br/>
<br/>
The function of the kaishaku, I believe, was as a backstop to <br/>
ensure that one way or another the condemned man died, and <br/>
there are stories of kaishaku making two, three or more cuts in <br/>
the attempt to get the thing done.<br/>
<br/>
When Ieyasu's son was obliged to commit seppuku, Ieyasu sent <br/>
Hattori Hanzo (his 'ninja chief') along to ensure everything <br/>
went without a hitch. At the last Hanzo could not perform, and <br/>
another (a samurai who's name I can't recall) stepped in. <br/>
Ieyasu was heard to say "Even that devil Hanzo couldn't... "<br/>
(from Sadler's bio. of Ieyasu)<br/>
<br/>
Again, I have doubts about the whole validity of seppuku as a <br/>
demonstration of how much agony you can inflict on yourself, as <br/>
I also think junshi etc. is a pointless waste of life...<br/>
<br/>
There is a phenomena that occurs when fighting men have no <br/>
fights in which to display their prowess - they turn upon <br/>
themselves or their compatriots to demonstrate their courage. <br/>
This is noted even in modern army units. I believe junshi etc. <br/>
is a peacetime development based on the fact that in battle <br/>
when a lord died his retainers invariably died alongside him in <br/>
the defeat.<br/>
<br/>
Imagine the position of the Takeda if Shingen's 24 generals <br/>
killed themselves on the death of their master? In wartime the <br/>
daimyo would seek to ensure that his retainers protected his <br/>
heir and worked for the continuance of the clan/han.<br/>
<br/>
There is a story, in the biog. of Master Swordsman Tesshu, of a <br/>
meeting he had with the Edo public executioner. The man used <br/>
to engage in the 'crossroad challenge' (can't recall term) in <br/>
which he would engage a passing samurai in swordplay.<br/>
<br/>
In the biog, Tesshu stepped in to stop a duel, and the samurai <br/>
challenged actually feinted!<br/>
<br/>
The executioner recounted to Tesshu that he would cross <br/>
swords with his opponent, and if he could feel tension in the <br/>
other's blade, he knew tha man was his. If, however, the other's <br/>
grip was loose and relaxed, he would opt for 'plan B', which was <br/>
to throw his sword at his opponent, and run away.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>The only time something like that would happen is in a Kurosawa movie (ref.<br/>
Kaede's death in "Ran"). There is not THAT much pressure in blood. I've seen<br/>
video of people being beheaded with a sword blow. The head doesn't "fly" -- it<br/>
drops.<br/>
<br/>
And, frankly, I've never seen that "sliver of flesh" chestnut anywhere but in<br/>
English sources -- usually citing someone's sensei. And as evidenced by someone<br/>
else whose sensei seems to think that "hara-kiri" and "seppuku" are different<br/>
things, citing a sensei for a non-martial arts technique point of history or<br/>
linguistics or culture is very dubious.<br/>
<br/>
Personally, I think that whole "sliver of flesh" thing is pure BS -- like a lot<br/>
of the bushido myth and mysticism quoted or followed by westerners into Japanese<br/>
martial history, it's another small item of minutiae about how picky, precise,<br/>
and disciplined samurai were -- and total hogwash.<br/>

<h3>Kaishaku technique</h3>
by <i>thomas5403</i>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1462003590">In Eishin Ryu (as Tom Helm states), Muso Shinden Ryu, Omori <br/>
Ryu, and at least 1 other Ryu I cannot identify, the cut does <br/>
not slice through the neck but stops and the blade 'lifts' as <br/>
it is drawn back (in an action that could sever the head <br/>
finally) before chiburi takes place.<br/>
<br/>
I have no refernece of koryu (old style) techniques, but am <br/>
willing to accept that leaving the head attached by a sliver of <br/>
flesh is an Edo-period 'finesse'.<br/>
<br/>
Iaido is concerned (as are all -do systems) to some degree with <br/>
the aesthetic, whereas -jutsu is concerned primarily with <br/>
combat effectiveness rather than what it looks like - hence <br/>
punching, kicking, scratching and spitting is allowable.<br/>
<br/>
I can well believe a Sengoku-era samurai being told this <br/>
'sliver' thing and thinking 'the hell with that, just cut his <br/>
head off'.<br/>

historical practise. It might have been an Edo thing when they were able to deal <br/>
with specialist swordsmen, but I really doubt that sort of thing was part of the <br/>
original idea, when a kaishaku was just a guy helping the process along.<br/>

believe that someone on a battlefield in 1523 would be<br/>
concered about where a head went or if blood got all<br/>
over the place. <br/>

	I hope from my earlier posts, I made it clear that I didn't think it <br/>
was anything but an Edo period practice. My point was that it was/is a <br/>
long held teaching of the Eishin Ryu and not something thought up in <br/>
the West. This is one more item, of many, I should like to research <br/>
further but it is my belief, as I stated earlier, that kaishaku were a <br/>
later add-on. To have a full blown Seppuku ceremony prior to the <br/>
Tokugawa period, was a rare thing, for persons of very high rank I am <br/>
thinking (The son of Ieyasu comes to mind). Most times I imagine <br/>
seppuku was a personal thing which took place in the heat of battle, <br/>
with no one around to assist...<br/>
