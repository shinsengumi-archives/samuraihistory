<h3>Wearing of swords</h3>
by <i>thomas5403</i>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1842224917">Short answer: Yes.<br/>
<br/>
The sword or swords were always worn on the left hip, the draw was<br/>
always with the right hand, and the two-hand grip was always with <br/>
the left hand closest to the body. If you were left-handed, you<br/>
simply <br/>
trained to be proficient either way.<br/>
<br/>
Did the Japanese 'train out' left-handedness as the Europeans used<br/>
to? I don't know.<br/>
<br/>
Having said that the a swordsman would be proficient with either hand<br/>
- as for example Miyamoto Musashi who is credited with founding the <br/>
Niten Ichi Ryu (Two Heaven School) in which both swords are drawn - <br/>
his argument being if you have two swords why only use one? Even so, <br/>
he continued to wear both swords on the left side.<br/>
<br/>
I do not know the draw technique.<br/>
<br/>
I was once told by a collector he came across a short sword with the<br/>
tang (the bit that goes into the hilt) curved the opposite way to the <br/>
blade (so the whole thing looked vaguely S-shaped). He had been <br/>
told the sword had probably been made for a one-armed man, the <br/>
counter-curve of the tang helping the balance of the blade.<br/>
<br/>
Unfortunately it was impossible to tell which arm the man used!<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-2142296978">They did not ALWAYS draw with their right hands, I<br/>
leanred a technique where you draw with your left.<br/>
this is not an easy move, it was used to drive the<br/>
pommel of the sword into the abdomen of an oponent,<br/>
the sword is then gripped with the right hand... and<br/>
used to take the head of the now winded oponent.<br/>
<br/>
Myamoto Musashi Used the smaller of the two swords in<br/>
his left hand.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
I hope this was helpful.<br/>
