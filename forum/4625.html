<div id="ygrps-yiv-944752672">Hey Welcome aboard .This is the place to be. There is a lot of knowledge being passed on by good people. The Sword is what made me interested in the Samurai as well. As well as many other topics like history, battles, and the people. <br/>

 </span></blockquote>Leaning it all is a big task. :) I suggest starting slow. Ask a few <br/>
specific questions about whatever it is you're most interested in. I'm <br/>
sure you'll get a lot of information from the good folks here.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-352312135">cipher, i too have somewhat of a sword collection, my most recent purchase is a zionochi by Paul Chen. its a gorgeous sword but takes a lot of care. so if you or anyone else has questions on sword care you can probably ask me.<br/>
