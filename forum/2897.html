<div id="ygrps-yiv-1236372699">Daring to risk my rep as the Class Leprechaun here,  I have done some game <br/>
theory on the Scots Highlanders and their  claymores and  the Samurai with their <br/>
katanas.   I am very proud of my Scots heritage,  if for nothing than the <br/>
Declaration of Arbroath, the world's first declaration of Independence.  In part <br/>
it reads: "we  fight for freedom,  which no good man surrenders but with his <br/>
life."  (After 300 years of fighting for Freedom, you would think my family <br/>
would have had enough!)   Anyhow,  the main weakness of the katana is that,  with <br/>
a two-handed haft (hold),  the samurai was perilously exposed under his arm <br/>
pits for a thrust.  This was a defect in Japanese armor never fully remedied, <br/>
while European knights had chain mail to cover that area by 1000 AD.  The <br/>
claymore broadsword,  however,  was used with one hand,  the other side protected <br/>
by a  target (the original of the name, and hence the round  '''target''' for <br/>
shooters later), or shield.   Shields,  at least to my knowledge,  never <br/>
appeared in samurai warfighting.  In the early battles of the Rising of 1745, the <br/>
Highlanders of Bonnie Prince Charlie terrified the British  ""sojers''' with <br/>
their claymores, amputating heads and limbs at will--as did katanas.  Having <br/>
both,  the claymore is a much heavier weapon with a wide straight blade,  always <br/>
at least 36 inches long.   The width is never less than one inch. The hand <br/>
guard is solid brass--the origin of the  ''brass knuckle."   It was not until <br/>
Culloden in April 1746,  the final battle, that British soldiers, trained by  "The <br/>
Butcher,"  the Duke of Cumberland,  learned to best the Highlanders.  The  <br/>
redcoat would lunge with his bayonet--if memory serves--at the kiltie laddie to <br/>
his left, getting him in the exposed right side and arm pit as he raised his <br/>
sword at the soldier on the soldier's left.  A chara dhil,  Jack M.  <br/>

	With all due respect to Scots heritage (a Carson myself), and to the <br/>
list for revisiting a weary subject, Samurai versus Highlander, I would <br/>
just like to point out that it might not be all that "cut and dried." <br/>
Kendo is assumed by many to be the prime example of Japanese <br/>
swordsmanship, and since Kendo primarily uses the two handed grip many <br/>
have the mistaken impression this is the (only) way to wield a katana. <br/>
However during the age of battles the uchi-katana was the sword of <br/>
choice for the armies of Japan. Uchi-katana is short for "kata-te uchi <br/>
katana", which literally means single-hand-strike sword. The tachi and <br/>
the katana were never limited to a two-handed grip and are just as <br/>
agile if not more so than a claymore.<br/>
	If Kendo is your only example BTW, you need only look at the <br/>
Kendo-kata and or the Seitei-Iai kata for single hand cuts, blocks and <br/>
thrusts...<br/>
