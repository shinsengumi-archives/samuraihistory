I gather the chance of being elevated to samurai rank varied quite a bit<br/>
from period to period, but in general it was hereditary.  (Draeger's<br/>
_Classical Bujutsu_, which I loaned out to one too many students, had some<br/>
details on this that I'm no longer in a position to check, unfortunately.)<br/>
As I recall, the greatest chances of elevation in station took place during<br/>
times of war, for the same reason that knighthoods in Europe were easier to<br/>
come by in such times:  more of the upper echelons were getting killed off,<br/>
creating space for upward mobility by those who could show their courage and<br/>
skill at appropriate moments (i.e., when your superiors are watching).<br/>
But given the hereditary element, to say there was an age at which one<br/>
became samurai is kind of self-contradicting.  But what I suspect you mean<br/>
is the age at which he became a warrior.  Assuming that's the case... There<br/>
was a coming of age ceremony (genpuku, or genbuku) held at 13 or 15, or<br/>
shortly before the lad was expected to go into battle for the first time,<br/>
according to Anthony J. Bryant's Osprey book _Samurai 1550 - 1600_.  (Some<br/>
of the colour plates in that are a little suspect, but the information in<br/>
the text seems to check out with other sources I've run across - save that<br/>
Bryant stresses the inflexible power of the bushido in motivating the<br/>
samurai, whereas Draeger and others mention the frequency with which this<br/>
code was violated by every class of samurai - to paraphrase "Pirates of the<br/>
Caribbean," "It's not so much rules as a set of guidelines.")  According to<br/>
Bryant, by the time of the genbuku ceremony the boy had already been in<br/>
fairly serious training for two to three years (and in some senses, had been<br/>
training all his life).  At genbuku the boy's head would first get the<br/>
shave-and-a-topknot treatment.  Since the age at which the ceremony took<br/>
place varies so much, I'd guess it was based on the individual's readiness,<br/>
but that's only a guess.  Anyone with more solid info?<br/>
Bryant also has an excellent website - sengokudaimyo.com - with a great deal<br/>
of very good information.  Apparently he's an SCA recreationist, working on<br/>
the living history version of his studies, which in my view gives him a much<br/>
better-rounded perspective of the daily life and details of training, etc.,<br/>
than most of the other academics.<br/>

<br/>
Just a few questions, would I be right in saying that you were born a<br/>
Samurai and not become one (apart from the few exceptions). To become<br/>
a Samurai you must have the right bloodline, is this correct? Also<br/>
how old would a boy be before he turned Samurai. And how old would he<br/>
have to be before his first battle or was it, when he proved himself<br/>
ready.<br/>

Hey<br/>
       I don't know about the other questions, but yes, aside from the<br/>
exceptions, someone was born into the samurai class as far as I know.  :-)<br/>
