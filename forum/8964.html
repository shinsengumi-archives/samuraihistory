<h3>Native Americans in Japan Pre-Meiji ?</h3>
by <i>steven_matsheshu</i>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1614822261">I have read and heard about this, but does anyone have actual details <br/>
to this :<br/>
<br/>
 Allegedly, a small group of Choctaw (full and mixed) came into Japan <br/>
in the early/mid 1800s and evaded the government long enough to make an <br/>
impression, alot of money, friends, etc.etc.....<br/>
<br/>
       One apparently got caught and spent time on a kind of house <br/>
arrest, where he compiled a Japanese/Choctaw Dictionary ?<br/>
  <br/>
     Of course, I will do my own research on this, but if the members <br/>
of this board could post any facts they happened to know about this, I <br/>
would be appreciative.<br/>
<br/>
  Thank you.</div>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-430756189">Look for "Ranald MacDonald in the land of the samurai" (sic) by Fred  <br/>
Schodt. Not sure of the title but the Author and the subject should  <br/>
connect you to the book fairly quickly...<br/>
