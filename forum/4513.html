 </span></blockquote>That is wrong! All small portions of Japan was small countries with their <br/>
independence and own emperator as well. <br/>
The first one who dreamt to have one nation and perhaps one world (for these <br/>
people, Japan was the entire world) was the Emperator Yamato, that unlike <br/>
Nobunaga, had peaceful goals and intentions in his heart. <br/>
<br/>
To quote him (Yamato Emperor, NOT Nobunaga) <br/>
<br/>
"On the earth there ins�t earth portions marked with lines and different <br/>
colours like a map. Why people of these earth portions had to fight each <br/>
others when the earth is only one?" <br/>

 </span></blockquote>Oooooo.... Very different contest... <br/>
<br/>
Hitler attempted to reunify the "old Sacred German Empire" that never <br/>
existed in history. Always when certain portions of his ideal map are in the <br/>
hands of germans, other portions was independent. Some would say that he did <br/>
attempted to do with the entire world what the bastard of Nobunaga attempted <br/>
with Japan. <br/>
<br/>
Hitler killed jews not due to racist motivations only, but also religious, <br/>
he also prosecuted gypsies, homosexuals and even germans who didn�t agreed <br/>
with his policy. <br/>
<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Comment: I do not agree. Hitler identified the cause<br/>
of the defeat of the previous German Empire as the<br/>
racial impurity, which he generalized into a larger<br/>
sphere of  historical context. <br/>
In essence, in his book, 'Mein Kampf', he claimed that<br/>
in order for an empire to last, it was necessary to<br/>
eliminate the racial impurity, the mass bulk of which<br/>
he also associated with Jews.<br/>
<br/>
As a practical realization of his 'theoretical'<br/>
reasoning, he devised a systematic mass execution,<br/>
which his followers 'efficiently' implemented.<br/>
<br/>
His ideal map of German nation, which I also believe<br/>
was on Hitler's mind, therefore was not the cause of<br/>
his 'mass' execuation in a strict sense whereas as for<br/>
Nobunaga, the reunification itself was the primary<br/>
cause of the execution.  The expansive warfare<br/>
motivated by his ideal territory can be quoted at most<br/>
as the secondary cause of the mass exectution. <br/>

 </span></blockquote>Although it may be apparently a race issue, notes on his mein kamph proves <br/>
wrong. <br/>
<br/>
Hitler mentioned in his mein kamph that no matter the race, an certain <br/>
people can be "evil" or "good" deppending on their cultural background. He <br/>
also said "the first step to destroy a nation, is to destroy its culture". <br/>
<br/>
He fought non christians in general at Germany, Jews, homosexuals, people <br/>
who was freethinkers and didn�t supported the Nazi Regime (they was sent to <br/>
concentration camps despite if they was "pure race"-dogs with pedigree or <br/>
not). So, more than racial, it was even more about an ideological <br/>
absolutism. <br/>
<br/>
In this way, he was very alike Nobunaga, Oda. <br/>
<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Octavio: Means: NO CHRISTIAN! Although the precedent catholic concentration <br/>
camps at Yugoslavia killed not only jews, non christians, homosexuals and <br/>
people who though differently of the interests of the Rebel Catholic <br/>
Ustashi, they also killed protestants, lutherans, catholic orthodox as well, <br/>
Germany under Adolph Hitler, killed just no christians. Other denominations <br/>
of christianity was more safer than it was in Yugoslavia. Religion is also a <br/>
set of morals and ideas, not only simple an belief system. If he was an <br/>
absolutist, he fough also, what he considered inconvenient religions for his <br/>
purposes. <br/>

 </span></blockquote>Octavio: I mean exactly what I mean. You added meaning to my stated phrases. <br/>
Japanese people does not taunt, at least at the time I learn japanese <br/>
history, things like "loosers was the evil" and "winners was the good", but <br/>
just telling the facts. They also din�t put in their history books that <br/>
Shinto do human sacrifices, and buddhists do the same as well. But if <br/>
christianity would take over Japan as it happened with my country, and <br/>
several scandinavian ones, Shinto and Buddhism would be despicted in history <br/>
books as "absolute EVIL". That was my point. <br/>

mentioned in some mangas as well at that time. Can you prove the contrary? I <br/>
don�t care if you do not believe me, or even if you believe as well. I am <br/>
not a preacher. My life�s meaning will not end if you don�t believe me. <br/>
Those who want know the truth, not only about what I stated, but about every <br/>
subject, must just not simply believe in what me or other people affirmed, <br/>
or skeptically disbelieve, but do their own research in all the sources they <br/>
can access. Including public libraries and internet. <br/>
<br/>
For an example... Who cares if you didn�t believe in what I stated about <br/>
Buddhism history in Japan and their co-relaction with Samurai? The sources, <br/>
like Kalama Sutta, shingon-tendai references are available even in english <br/>
nowaddays. And if one want study the tripitaka, one can become a monk, learn <br/>
Pali and spend a life reading it. In fact, is what even Buddha recomended to <br/>
do in Kalama Sutra. Don�t believe me, go and read it. he he he <br/>
