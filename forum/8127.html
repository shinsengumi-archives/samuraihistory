 </span></blockquote>Yes, even if he really wasn't a great swordsman (I really don't know, to <br/>
many conficting theories) he was a good artist!! His sumi-e is very good <br/>
if you like the free Zen styles. His book is at least interesting in <br/>
English. Haven't read it in the original. The Taiga drama was good as well.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>I agree, I think if you reread my post I state very clearly that what <br/>
makes a good book is not the media that its published in but the editing <br/>
and reviewing that are performed upon it. If I gave the impression the <br/>
ebooks= self-published I apologize since I often read academic journals <br/>
online which are probably as far away from self-published as you can get <br/>
in terms of handling.<br/>
