<div id="ygrps-yiv-2097317872">SamuraiHistory Group hi! In case my previous message didn't come <br/>
through, I post this again:<br/>
" <br/>
I have been following the group for some time, and would like to <br/>
thank everybody<br/>
for the very insightful information on the women warriors topic, the<br/>
Hara-kari/Seppuku and such. Thanks!<br/>
I'm in the midst of researching, and would like to get my facts <br/>
right:<br/>
From what I understand, the nagamaki blade may be as long and as <br/>
shaped as a<br/>
katana's. the instances I have found in books and on the web <br/>
describe the<br/>
nagamaki pole shorter than the naginata's, and sometimes equals the <br/>
length of<br/>
the nagamaki blade on the other end.<br/>
Is this true, or was there an instance of a katana blade on a <br/>
naginata pole?<br/>
<br/>
Thanks!<br/>
<br/>
Rami <br/>

 </span></blockquote>Did you not see it? I approved it, and it came through<br/>
my email, so I saw it, but if other people are having<br/>
a problem, please let me know so I can try to figure<br/>
it out. Another poster didn't seem to see an answer I<br/>
had given him, so maybe there is an issue. Like I said<br/>
I got your original post, but short of telling you to<br/>
read Bottomley and Hopson (and as far as I can tell,<br/>
you already know everything they'd be able to tell<br/>
you), there's nothing I can contribute. <br/>
