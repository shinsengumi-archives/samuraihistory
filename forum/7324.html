<div id="ygrps-yiv-1116672479">Hello, <br/>
  here's my ?<br/>
     - are there any museums in the United States that display authentic samurai armour?<br/>
           (i've been told the best way to get to know how to make samurai armour is to see the real thing up close)(problem is,...i don't know where to look)<br/>
     - the museum would also have to be friendly enough for me to look up close, maybe handle, and take close up pic's of the armour for a better reference.<br/>
      (i've tried to make dif. parts of samurai armour but they never seem to come out right,....basically the things that you can't really make out how it was done by just by looking at a picture in a book)( it's these simple little things that would be solved if i just got a look at the real thing) (i live in Buffalo, NY & there are no museums around me that have authentic samurai armour on display) Hope to get some great idea's.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1469198435">Hi<br/>
<br/>
I dont know about your part of the states but I have<br/>
visited the Milwaukee public museum overin Wisconsin<br/>
several times. they have 7 sets on public display and<br/>
several more in the store rooms. If they were more<br/>
than pleased to leave me (a Brit) all alone for<br/>
several hours with no one watching over my back while<br/>
I did drawing, measurements and photos then I am sure<br/>
they will be more than happy to let a fellow<br/>
countryman in.<br/>
<br/>
They also have a nice collection of Yari and Naginata,<br/>
as well as a scroll which contains many drawing in<br/>
full colour, of tthe different parts of a suit of<br/>
armour.<br/>
<br/>
If any one is in the milwaukee area they may wish to<br/>
check this stuff out. My friend deals with the museum<br/>
with regards to Native Indian items and recently<br/>
several talks etc have been cancelled due to lack of<br/>
funds. He says this is now going to have a knock on<br/>
effect to other departments and other displays. It<br/>
would be a shame if the museum suffered as I<br/>
personally felt it was one fo the best I have seen on<br/>
my travels in the USA.<br/>
