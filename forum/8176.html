<h3>Hatamoto of the Shimada family</h3>
by <i>decain1</i>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-118597704">I just joined the group.  I'm doing family genealogy research and <br/>
will be glad to share any relevant findings.  I recently had a 30-<br/>
year old family letter translated between my Japanese aunt and her <br/>
sister (my deceased mother).  I only speak English.  My great-great-<br/>
grandfather was a Hatamoto Samurai who had a rank/reward/status of <br/>
1500 koku.  The family name is Shimada.  His given name is Sugo.  <br/>
His other name(perhaps imani?) is Naoaki.  I have independently <br/>
confirmed all the kanji characters in the name translation <br/>
except "Sugo".  The first kanji is "su", but the second one ("go") <br/>
is the best guess of the translator.  Sugo Shimada served in the <br/>
early 1800's in the Edo (Tokyo) area, likely in/near Honjo.  He had <br/>
a son (Nobushi Naoharu Shimada) born in 1858, who served under <br/>
General Nogi.<br/>
<br/>
My questions are:<br/>
1.  What additional resources (beyond this very helpful site) are <br/>
recommended for this type of researching?  I've done extensive web <br/>
browsing and have begun to get some books.<br/>
2.  Today, Shimada is a relatively common surname in Japan.  In the <br/>
Samurai days, was there only one Shimada clan, or perhaps one <br/>
Shimada clan per city/area?  I don't know how unique the name was <br/>
during the Samaurai period.  I have read that this surname is <br/>
contained in ancient Japanese family name records.  If there is any <br/>
Samurai history about the Shimada family, and if there is some sort <br/>
of connection between "those" Shimada's and my family, I would love <br/>
to learn about it.<br/>
3.  Is there a kamon associated with the Shimada family/clan?  Where <br/>
might I look for a copy of it?  I have not found it among the <br/>
samurai-archives and other helpful web sites.<br/>
4.  Can someone confirm what the second names (Naoaki and Naoharu) <br/>
typically represent for Samurai, especially in a society where many <br/>
had only one or two names at that time?  Were their names associated <br/>
with the Samurai coming of age ceremony, or perhaps names given to <br/>
them after their deaths?  I'm just not clear about that.<br/>
5.  Can a tell anything about the status in society (or other <br/>
things) of Sugo Shimada as a Hatamoto in the Edo area with 1500 <br/>
koku?  Whatever they possessed (and it appeared to have been much), <br/>
survived the Meiji restoration, but did not survive the US strategic <br/>
bombing campaign during WWII.  The surviving family members were <br/>
back to "ground zero" in 1945.<br/>
<br/>
Any perspectives would be greatly appreciated,<br/>

Shimada was not uncommon back then either, part of the problem is you  <br/>
will need the kanji, and since everybody from Edo was from somewhere  <br/>
else you'll want clues to the home province, family temple? sect of  <br/>
Buddhism?<br/>

Yes, many, but there will be families that used mon not associated  <br/>
with the name, cousins that used the mon but not the last name, and  <br/>
unrelated families that used it for unknown reasons. May be hard to  <br/>
pin down until you know for sure where you're family is from<br/>

Probably was custom in this family to have a NAO-something as head of  <br/>
the family, thus all male children (at least the ones likely to  <br/>
succeed the father) were given a Nao-something official name, Sugo  <br/>
and Nobushi were familiar names perhaps used only within the  <br/>
household, by close family members<br/>

1500 is not a bad salary, Hatamoto implies direct vassal of the  <br/>
Shogun, would be pretty cool if you could prove it and would narrow  <br/>
your search but then again alot of the Edo records were lost...<br/>
-t<br/>
PS geneology sites will likely be more helpful than us.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-286439570">Tom:<br/>
<br/>
Thanks!  In response:<br/>
<br/>
1. Japanese-American History Archives - I'll check it out.  My mother <br/>
immigrated to the US in 1958 (as my father's wife), and is the only <br/>
Japanese born member of my family in the US.  Both have passed, so <br/>
gathering info is difficult.<br/>
<br/>
2.  Shimada kanji - My aunt writes it as shima(island)-da(rice <br/>
paddy).  The shima is ", and the da(ta) is "c.  They were living in <br/>
the Honjo area of Tokyo (Old Edo), at least in 1858 - I can't go back <br/>
further yet.  I know they were/are Buddhist, but don't know what <br/>
sect.  I can study that to see how to ask my aunt that question, <br/>
though.  As a Christian, I have a general knowledge of Buddhism, but <br/>
not a specific knowledge of its history in Japan.<br/>
<br/>
3. Mon - Thanks for explaining the variations in how kamon have <br/>
developed- I will need to ask my aunt or other surviving family <br/>
members if a family mon still exists.<br/>
<br/>
4. "Official" Names - Thanks!<br/>
<br/>
5. Hatamoto - I knew who they were as a group, but I'll work with my <br/>
aunt to get more family information.  I have one generation of <br/>
official Japanese family registry - perhaps there is a way to get <br/>
other older ones (they are quite delicate and elegant pieces of <br/>
paper!).  I will also start working with and looking up some Japanese <br/>
geneology sites and groups.<br/>
<br/>
You have been very helpful!<br/>
