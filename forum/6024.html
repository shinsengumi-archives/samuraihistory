love the look I get when instead of saying "Sou desu<br/>
ka" I say "Sayou de gozarimasuru ka?"...it's a cross<br/>
between "are you nuts" and "are you an alien"...lol<br/>

 </span></blockquote>I sympathize. I spent my year as an exchange student<br/>
in a family with three extroverted females (mom and 2<br/>
daughters) and one very introverted father.<br/>
Additionally, when I wasn't with them, I spent most of<br/>
my time speaking with my girlfriend. About 4 months in<br/>
they started laughing at me, telling me "you sound<br/>
like a girl". I got mad--after all, wasn't it their<br/>
fault? I WAS imitating them, since that's what they<br/>
heard. Plus, at school 95% of the teachers were<br/>
female, and they don't teach you malespeak. All the<br/>
guys in the class lodged a protest and lobbied for<br/>
more male teachers, and at home everyone was put on<br/>
notice to correct me anytime I spoke like a girl.<br/>
Plus, I started paying attention to men on TV. <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-834634696">Hi Lizzie -<br/>
<br/>
Many years ago someone told me his dojo were being good little <br/>
aikidoka and saying 'thank you' to a visiting sensei from Japan <br/>
at the end of an evening's workout.<br/>
<br/>
Each time he muttered something in reply, which later none of <br/>
them could make out.<br/>
<br/>
One of their number had a Japanes woman working at his company, <br/>
and at the water cooler he asked her if she might help him with <br/>
translation. She agreed and he repeated what had happened. She <br/>
went bright red and walked away.<br/>
<br/>
Some time later she appeared at his desk, and apologised for <br/>
her reaction, but explained that it was locker-room talk and <br/>
translated roughly as 'up your arse.' (This is England, <br/>
remember.)<br/>
<br/>
So I'm thinking you're probably right.<br/>

My second teacher was a little old lady type. One student brought in a <br/>
pirated copy of the then just released in Japan 'Akira'. She ran it for <br/>
about 5 minutes, mostly because I think she was shocked silly. I didn't <br/>
understand a single bit! It did inspire several lectures on polite <br/>
speech and men's and women's language.<br/>

Good evening to you, and thanks for such a charming story.  Yes, I chuckled and shared it with a couple of friends; they're <br/>
wondering what the words were.  I told them to check out Babelfish if they wanted to know; it'd likely be close enough.  I wonder if <br/>
the visiting sensei was one who abhorred Westerners.  I cannot presume to accord the 'traditional/legendary' traits of detachment <br/>
and courtesy to all sensei.<br/>

I shall be very careful about my learning any Japanese.  And from whom.<br/>
<br/>
Always happy to laugh,<br/>

Hi Lizzie -<br/>
<br/>
Many years ago someone told me his dojo were being good little<br/>
aikidoka and saying 'thank you' to a visiting sensei from Japan<br/>
at the end of an evening's workout.<br/>
<br/>
Each time he muttered something in reply, which later none of<br/>
them could make out.<br/>
<br/>
One of their number had a Japanes woman working at his company,<br/>
and at the water cooler he asked her if she might help him with<br/>
translation. She agreed and he repeated what had happened. She<br/>
went bright red and walked away.<br/>
<br/>
Some time later she appeared at his desk, and apologised for<br/>
her reaction, but explained that it was locker-room talk and<br/>
translated roughly as 'up your arse.' (This is England,<br/>
remember.)<br/>
<br/>
So I'm thinking you're probably right.<br/>
<br/>
