<div id="ygrps-yiv-1045554869">The Japanese were not head hunters in the strict anthropological sense. They<br/>
did not go to war for the express purpose of taking heads. Rather, the<br/>
taking of heads was an adjunct to war and was used to tally enemy losses, to<br/>
document personal bravery, and to verify the deaths of enemy leaders. Once<br/>
these purposes had been met the heads were disposed of by burying or<br/>
burning. Head hunting societies, in contrast, usually retained taken heads<br/>
on permanent display.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1555551948">thanks for your answers but the are not much news<br/>
@ Delwayne Arakaki: the osprey text seems just to be there to fill a page.<br/>
@ Francois BOUTRY: i got that serie from Terje Solum and also "the samurai warrior" Thomas Comlan. In Comlans book I did not find anything about kubi kiri and in Solums booklet are just a few sentences to complete any black and white drawings. I got also "samurai battles" from Michael Sharpe. That one also with no results.<br/>
@ Robert: OK we could describe the samurai as a kind of souvenir hunters. But that souvenirs were severed heads. No help to my question. Is it?<br/>
<br/>
So are there any japanese sources for the head inspections in the mediewal Japan?</div>
