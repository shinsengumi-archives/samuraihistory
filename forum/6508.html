<h3>Transitional Samurai Equipment</h3>
by <i>russcat9</i>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1615387148">How late into the 15thC (or beyond) would it be feasible for samurai<br/>
armies or contingents of feudal lords to still be wearing armour &<br/>
using weapons more common to the earlier Muromachi period, say<br/>
1350-1450? ie o-sode and transitional o-yoroi/haramaki, with naginata<br/>
and bow, but few or no yari etc.<br/>
<br/>
And if feasible, what would be the likely reasons?<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Most of my information comes from Bottomley and<br/>
Hopson, or from Turnbull--neither of which are in<br/>
front of me right this second. However, I think it's<br/>
perfectly feasible for samurai to be wearing older<br/>
pieces up until the end of the Sengoku. Reasons would<br/>
include a. the ability to show off possesion of an<br/>
antique armor or b. inability to buy something better.<br/>
In case a you're looking at upper level daimyo that<br/>
may not ever be in combat, so it's nice to look<br/>
pretty. In case b, he probably can't afford anything<br/>
more, so he's making due with battle spoils or cheaper<br/>
old stuff. <br/>
<br/>
Make sense?<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
Yes, that makes good sense. Convenient too! What about naginata - did<br/>
they largely disappear amongst retainers and ashigaru after the Gempei<br/>
Wars, to be replaced by yari?<br/>
<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Not sure when the naginata was replaced--I'd have to<br/>
check with Bottomley. I'd think it was a fairly good<br/>
weapon in the street fighting of the Onin. Perhaps it<br/>
was replaced when the fighting moved out to the<br/>
provinces and took place more often on horseback?<br/>
anyone?<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1724604664">My understanding is that they were still in use during the Muromachi<br/>
era, but greatly outnumbered by yari the later the period went. I<br/>
think they also became longer.<br/>
