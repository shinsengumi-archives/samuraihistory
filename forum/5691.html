<h3>When is a sword...</h3>

<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1741527962">Following on from the current debate, I read somewhere of a samurai <br/>
sleeping with a 'night sword' close at hand.<br/>
<br/>
I have always assumed this to be a wakazashi/kodachi/whatever, <br/>
generally a short-bladed weapon more suitable indoors - avoids the <br/>
embarrasment of getting your blade stuck in the rafters as you assume<br/>
an intruder-terrifying jodan kamae!<br/>
<br/>
As an aside, in Gohatto there's a scene where an older samurai<br/>
instructs the protagonist to 'choke his sword' when fighting indoors -<br/>
a grip with both hands almost touching that would significantly reduce<br/>
the blade's 'arc of operation' as it were.<br/>
