<h3>Back in touch</h3>
by <i>gilliru</i>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-711247965">Dear everyone,<br/>
<br/>
My email server collapsed so I've been out of touch for a couple of weeks. If <br/>
any one answered my request for a discussion about Choshu's role in the <br/>
bakumatsu period, I'm sorry for not replying - maybe you could post it again.<br/>
<br/>
In the meantime I have another question: does anyone have information or <br/>
can suggest resources on life in the imperial court in the bakumatsu period. <br/>
I've become fascinated by the seven nobles who were spirited away to <br/>
Choshu after the defeat by Satsuma and Aizu in 1863.<br/>
<br/>
Many thanks,<br/>
<br/>
Gillian</div>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1069639388">as to more precise info I'll check around but I've just finished Murdochs<br/>
third volume of his history of Japan and it gives a lot of info on the<br/>
situation of the court, people events etc before and during this period. It<br/>
may be dated but it tells a more complete story than more modern works.</div>
