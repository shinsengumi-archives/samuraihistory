I don't have reference about Kenshin's cut but a WWII machine gun barrel<br/>
would be weaker if hardly used and then really hot rather then a huge<br/>
matchlock. Anyway, even an O-Kanehira (?), I hardly doubt a blade could<br/>
cut the matchlock and pass thru the Ashigaru armor or Jingasa. Remember<br/>
that legends about the cutting powers of blades are common in any<br/>
culture, especially the japanese one. Most likely, the blade cut the<br/>
armor, but not the weapon... The only way to solve the matter is ask for<br/>
a Tameshigiri<br/>

Thanks for your comments.  With 40 years of reading under my belt heaven knows<br/>
where I read that snippet, but it IS stuck in my memory.  Often I find it better<br/>
to comment while something is current, rather than wait the x months it takes<br/>
for me to find it in my archives and give the reference long after the thread is<br/>
as cold as rigor mortis!!  I could have read it in the English To-ken Society's<br/>
"Programme", but I will keep an eye out for it as I trawl my books and journals.<br/>
<br/>
Just before sending this I did a google search using "uesugi kenshin" thinking I<br/>
might find the gun-slicing story - but, alas - I found instead some 1,530 hits<br/>
and gave up almost before I'd started.  However, this might be interesting<br/>
staright off for those with a particular interest in kenshin:<br/>

<h3>R: [samuraihistory] Re: Slicing rifle barrels</h3>
by <i>Carlo Tacchini</i>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-684293676">I would not hurt you in any manner.<br/>
Even the story of the Bren barrel that I remember most likely was read<br/>
by me in something like a Reader's Digest article about the taking of<br/>
Singapore or Yamashita's conquest of Malaya, so it is far than<br/>
historically accurate.<br/>
You surely know about Tameshigiri reporting an unbelievable number of<br/>
bodies cut thru by a certain blade. Think that if Kenshin had a blade<br/>
able to cut a Teppo, most likely Shingen's fan would be cut in their<br/>
famous fight, changing Japan's history, hehehe...     <br/>

<br/>
Tom, Carlo,<br/>
Thanks for your comments.  With 40 years of reading under my belt heaven<br/>
knows<br/>
where I read that snippet, but it IS stuck in my memory.  Often I find<br/>
it better<br/>
to comment while something is current, rather than wait the x months it<br/>
takes<br/>
for me to find it in my archives and give the reference long after the<br/>
thread is<br/>
as cold as rigor mortis!!  I could have read it in the English To-ken<br/>
Society's<br/>
"Programme", but I will keep an eye out for it as I trawl my books and<br/>
journals.<br/>
<br/>
Just before sending this I did a google search using "uesugi kenshin"<br/>
thinking I<br/>
might find the gun-slicing story - but, alas - I found instead some<br/>
1,530 hits<br/>
and gave up almost before I'd started.  However, this might be<br/>
interesting<br/>
staright off for those with a particular interest in kenshin:<br/>

<h3>Re: [samuraihistory] sword</h3>
by <i>madbearscave</i>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-6524586">Hi Christin,<br/>
<br/>
Like you Bushido fascinates me. I'm learning just as<br/>
you are and this is what I have discovered thus far.<br/>
The early Japanese bushi used the spear(yari) and<br/>
bow(yumi) as his main weapons of choice. The sword or<br/>
katana developed into his weapon of choice in later<br/>
periods. Especially when the military class was<br/>
gaining more and more power(Kamakura Shogunate). Note,<br/>
this is just a general over view.<br/>
<br/>
Now for a good book on Japanese sword techniques I<br/>
recommend "Secrets of the Samurai" by Oscar Ratti and<br/>
Adele Westbrook. This is a very good book and it gives<br/>
allot of information on Bujutsu as a whole from<br/>
samurai to ashigaru to sohei.<br/>
<br/>
Also Miyamoto Musashi's book "The Book of the Five<br/>
Rings" is dedicated not just to strategy but to the<br/>
way of the sword and Musashi's style of kenjutsu.<br/>
<br/>
I'm currently researching the Shimazu Clan and samurai<br/>
of Satsuma in southern Kyushu. They were well known<br/>
for their bravery and ferocity in combat. These<br/>
samurai were great swordsmen as well and so as part of<br/>
my research I would love to discover their fighting<br/>
techniques.<br/>
<br/>
Also besides the Katana another sword popular with<br/>
samurai was the No-dachi or field sword. This was more<br/>
or less a two handed sword and in the hands of a well<br/>
trained samurai proved quite deadly.<br/>
<br/>
Hope this helps. Let me know what you find.<br/>
