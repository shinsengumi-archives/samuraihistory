I think none of the authors below have written anything in the past <br/>

I would take Papinot with a grain of salt though - I haven't seen his <br/>
dictionary in quite a while, but I do remember we came across quite a <br/>
few innacuracies- many of which turnbull reproduces.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1498680468">I believe he is a better writer in the original,<br/>
  The translation lacks style. Another problem is that Japanese writers<br/>
assume the audience knows the subject well so they often pass over or sketch<br/>
briefly those scenes which are very popular and well known. The advantage of<br/>
a western writer is that they will more often than not give plenty of<br/>
background. IMHO<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Agreed I am surrounded by OLDE BOOKES<br/>
    If you must be inacurate go to the source, one thing in Papinot's favor<br/>
is he gives the kanji, from there you jump to your Japanese reference and<br/>
off you go...<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1574005126">Yes I like him too, and he is incredibly popular here in Japan even 7 years<br/>
after his death. Unfortunately only 3 of his books have been translated into<br/>
english. As well as The Last Shogun, 'Drunk as a lord' a collection of four<br/>
stories set in the bakumatsu period was published by Kodansha last year I<br/>
believe. I highly recommend that one. The third book "The heart remembers<br/>
home" I haven't read but I don't think its an historical novel.<br/>
