<br/>
Topic: <br/>
<br/>
This is to be a piece of fiction writing taking place within an <br/>
unspecified period in Japanese history falling between 1467 to 1868, <br/>
and specificaly involving a real samurai from Japanese history, and <br/>
a particular historical event in that Samurai's life, however the <br/>
true historical figures need not be the main characters.<br/>
<br/>
------------<br/>
<br/>
Parameters: <br/>
<br/>
The story is required to be more than 1,000 words, with a 3,000 word <br/>
limit. It can be done in the first person, or the third person, and <br/>
must be a complete short story, not an excerpt from a larger story. <br/>
<br/>
------------<br/>
<br/>
Entrance Fee and Details: <br/>
<br/>
The entrance fee is $6, payable via PAYPAL to: webmaster @ samurai-<br/>
archives.com. Be sure to include your full name, and Yahoo ID and <br/>
Delphi Forums ID if you have one when you pay the entrance fee. You <br/>
will receive a confirmation email that your submission has been <br/>
received.<br/>
Why an entrance fee? Because the winner of the contest will win the <br/>
total sum of all fees collected.<br/>
Note: Entrance fees are non-refundable, so if you pay the fee, be <br/>
sure to send in a story, as the fees will stay as part of the total <br/>
the winner will receive. <br/>
If you do not have a credit card or paypal account but still want to <br/>
enter, please send an email to webmaster @ samurai-archives.com <br/>
about sending a money order. <br/>
<br/>
-------------<br/>
<br/>
Submission Information: <br/>
<br/>
Submissions are to be sent to webmaster @ samurai-archives.com in a <br/>
WORD .Doc format. At the top of the first page, please include your <br/>
full name, your Yahoo ID, and your Delphi Forums ID (if applicable) <br/>
so it can be matched with your entrance fee. You will receive a <br/>
confirmation email that your submission has been received. <br/>
<br/>
-------------<br/>
<br/>
Judging and Winning the contest: <br/>
<br/>
Submissions will be judged by a panel of Yahoo group and Delphi <br/>
forum members who are not submitting stories. The judges will not be <br/>
told who the authors of each respective submision are until after <br/>
the judging has closed, to avoid any swaying of the judges. The <br/>
recipient of the submissions (The Samurai Archives webmaster) will <br/>
not be a judge, and will only moderate the proceedings, to keep <br/>
entries anonymous. The winner will receive the total of all <br/>
collected entrance fees, and the winning story will be featured on <br/>
the Samurai Archives site as the winner of the 2005 Samurai Fiction <br/>
contest. All stories will be placed in the 'Fan Fiction' section of <br/>
the Samurai Archives as well. <br/>

Do you want the story to be in single space or double space? What about the point size?<br/>
