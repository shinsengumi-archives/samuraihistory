<div id="ygrps-yiv-463808246">I haven't laughed that much in ages. Tears were squirting out of my <br/>
eyes reading that thread. I had this vision of Snoop Dogg in a <br/>
kimono, his face painted for kabuki. (Giggle. Snort.) Hey, as an <br/>
aside, my husband's been practicing kendo for about thirty years. We <br/>
recently watched 'Ghost Dog' and hubby went into a fit of spleen. It <br/>
seems the main character puts a katana back into its sheath UPSIDE-<br/>
DOWN- he's slice his thumb open if he tried to do that in real life. <br/>
(Giggle. Snort. Chuckle.)<br/>
<br/>
God, will it ever end?<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-261740710">Snoop Dogg w/Kabuki makeup?  Okay, now that's Scary.  :-D!  And yes, <br/>
to see Snoop and 50 in period dress for that time in Japan's history would be a <br/>
howler!  Just thinking about it makes me smile.  Take care, y'all.<br/>
