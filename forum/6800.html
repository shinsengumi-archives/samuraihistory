<div id="ygrps-yiv-1958102270">Thanks for pointing this film out, I hadn't heard of it and it sounds<br/>
interesting, any clues as to where I could track down a copy? Amazon<br/>
comes up blank. Anybody have any other suggestions for films from this<br/>
era of Japanese history?<br/>
<br/>
Also, thanks for the info on bushi/samurai. I seem to vaguely remember<br/>
Eiko Ikegami mentioning it briefly in the introduction to 'Taming of the<br/>
Samurai', which I'll check when I get home. I had thought that prior to<br/>
the Tokugawa Bakufu bushi was the preferred term, where as during the<br/>
Edo period the preferred term was samurai, as 'one who serves' was a<br/>
perhaps more the image the Bakufu was looking to promote than 'warrior'.<br/>
'Samurai' seems to carry more prestige with it. I don't think I've ever<br/>
read anything suggesting that though.<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>The oldest son is usually named (in the family) as Ichiro or Taro. To this is <br/>
often added a sort of protheme that is either auspicious (Dai=big, Kin=gold, <br/>
Ryu=dragon) or showing attachment to one of the ancient houses (Tou=Fujiwara, <br/>
Gen=Minamoto, Kitsu=Tachibana)... in this case, it's "Hei" for Taira, and the <br/>
"-ro" is dropped. Essentially, its his name for use within the family and by <br/>
close childhood friends.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Ichimon is the common word translated as "clan" these days.<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>There was no difference. Bushi just sounded more fancy, being a Sino-Japanese <br/>
word -- much as an Englishman who's a knight might like to style himself as a <br/>
chevalier.<br/>

<br/>
Angus, I don't know where you live so can't help you much. Tales of <br/>
the Taira Clan and other films by Mizoguchi Kenji are in the British Film <br/>
Library Sales Catalogue, along with some Kurosawa, Ichikawa etc. It's <br/>
not huge selection. They are around fifteen pounds - quite expensive. I <br/>
actually live in South Australia and borrow these and other Japanese <br/>
videos  from the State Library. It's a great system.<br/>
<br/>
It's a fine movie, set in the 12th century at the time when the bushi/<br/>
samurai are about to come to power, very beautifully filmed and acted. <br/>
The costumes, and art direction in general, are wonderful.<br/>
<br/>
I think Tales of the Yin-Yang Masters also gives a very good feel for <br/>
Heian period settings and clothes etc.<br/>
<br/>
Cheers,<br/>
<br/>

 </span></blockquote>No, it was his name. Yoshikawa's "Shin-Heike<br/>
Monogatari" explains it--it was his yobina. Most<br/>
samurai had several names. The yobina was what the<br/>
family members and others "familiar" with the person<br/>
would call them. For example, Minamoto Yoshitsune was<br/>
"Kurou" (9th Son), so his full name would be written<br/>
as Minamoto Kurou Yoshitsune. Usually you see these in<br/>
names having to do with either birth order (Jiro,<br/>
Saburo, etc) or will be names ending in -hei/bei or<br/>
-e'emon, etc. It can be frustrating when trying to<br/>
track individuals through historical texts, because it<br/>
may refer to a person in one place as Kiyomori, the<br/>
next as Heita, the next as Rokuhara-dono....etc. <br/>
