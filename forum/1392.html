<h3>Clan Genealogies</h3>
by <i>kitsuno</i>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-641313075">I'm trying to put together an extended genealogy of the Sengoku <br/>
Daimyo - - most seem to have been related by marriage or offspring, <br/>
including the Toyotomi, Takeda, Hojo, Oda, etc.  Right now I'm trying <br/>
to figure out two things - which of Takeda Shingen's children were <br/>
born from Lady Sanjo, and which of Oda Nobunaga's children were born <br/>
from Kitsuno.  Also trying to figure out who Kitsuno's father is - <br/>
probable someone obvious that I've overlooked.  <br/>
Any help is appreciated.</div>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1088490979">I wish I could help. I've looked at all the genealogies that I have, in<br/>
Rekishi Gunzo, Saigen Nihonshi, Visual  Nihonshi. While they give extensive<br/>
info on children they almost never give any info on who was the mother. I<br/>
have the names of all the sons of Nobunaga but the daughters are just listed<br/>
as 'onna'. Even more frustrating is that  even when they do they often<br/>
identify the mother as simply the daughter of some family without giving her<br/>
personal name.However in issue #20 of the rekishi gunzo series there is a<br/>
discussion of Nobunaga and Nohime (Saitos daughter). It says there are<br/>
different and conflicting records as to the matrilineal of some of nobunagas<br/>
children. It does say that Nobutata and Nobuo were the sons of 'a daughter<br/>
of the Ikoma'. Interesting to note Nohime's mother was the daughter of<br/>
Akechi Mitsustugu (not sure of the pronunciation) who was Akechi Mitsuhides<br/>
grandfather.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-404777407">Thanks, that helps - and I just figured out that Kitsuno was the <br/>
daughter of Ikoma Iemune, so I guess she bore Nobutada and Nobuo.  <br/>
She died pretty young, so it makes sense.  After working on this off <br/>
and on (mostly off) for the past few weeks, it is starting to look <br/>
like every major Daimyo had some sort of relation to every other <br/>
daimyo in the sengoku period. Instead of playing the 'Kevin Bacon' <br/>
game, you could play the 'Takeda Shingen' game. (for anyone who <br/>
doesn't know what that is, the theory is that every actor in <br/>
existence can be traced back to Kevin Bacon with 5 or less movies.)<br/>
So far I have 55 samurai and 'Onna'.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1698947099">Hello<br/>
Kitsuno(Ikoma-no-kata) was the mother of Nobutada ,Nobuo(Nobukatsu) <br/>
and Toku-hime(Gotoku).<br/>
Nobutaka's mother was Saka-shi whose familly rank was relatively low <br/>
and his birth was reported late,so Nobutaka,actually the 2nd son,was <br/>
treated as the 3rd son.<br/>
<br/>
Sanjo was the mother of Yoshinobu,Nobuchika,Nobuyuki.<br/>
Katsuyori's mother was Suwa-Goryonin(Koi-hime)whose father,Suwa <br/>
yorishige had been killed by Shingen.<br/>
Morinobu(Nishina)'s mother was Aburagawa-bunin.<br/>
<br/>
hope this helps<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-18367421">That helps a LOT in getting things in order - Now just a couple more <br/>
questions --- <br/>
<br/>
In my notes, I had Takeda Harukiyo (Nishina Morinobu)'s mother's <br/>
father as 'Yugawa' Nobumori.  I don't remember where I got that from, <br/>
but did I misread "Aburagawa" as "Yugawa" or was "Yugawa" his <br/>
grandfather's correct last name?<br/>
<br/>
Also, I have the mothers for all of Shingen's children now except for <br/>
Takeda (Kadoyama) Yoshihisa and the daughter that married Uesugi <br/>
Kagekatsu (I don't have her actual name either - my sources all <br/>
say "Onna") - anyone have thier mother(s)?.<br/>
<br/>
As for Oda Nobutaka's mother, Saka-shi - does the -shi just denote <br/>
that she is from the Saka clan, or does the -shi have another meaning?<br/>
<br/>
Thanks for the help.  I'm up to 98 related samurai so far (Takeda <br/>
Shingen is the 'source person' for the extended family tree - I'm <br/>
using genealogy software, it makes it a lot easier to keep track of).<br/>

 </span></blockquote>I have never heard the name of Kadoyama Yoshihisa.Isn't it Kazurayama <br/>
Nobusada,Shingen's 6th son.<br/>
The daughter who married Kagekatsu is generally known by the name <br/>
Kiku-hime.<br/>
Aburagawa-bunin bore both of them.She also was the mother of Matsu-<br/>
hime who was to marry Oda Nobutada(Kimyoumaru).<br/>
