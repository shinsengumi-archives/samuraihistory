<h3>Showing of status</h3>
by <i>snipersergeant2000</i>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-596957823">I was wondering about how a samurai would show status of his rank like military today(medals, ribbons etc.) or if he was even allowed to show his rank?  I understand samurai would were the crest of the clan he was joined with.  I was also wondering about facial hair.  I have seen some traditional pictures of older or senior men with facial hair and younger men having the clean shave.  This may seem very stupid but was having facial hair a symbol of seniority or age?<br/>
 <br/>
Thanks,<br/>
Robert<br/>

I take it from your email address that you might be in<br/>
the military? I am too--US Army. Anyways, they didn't<br/>
really have anything quite like we did--no rank<br/>
insignia or anything like sergeant's stripes or<br/>
general's stars. <br/>
<br/>
Seniority within a clan would be shown in various<br/>
ways--seating arrangements at a conference, for<br/>
example. The higher ups up front, lesser samurai at<br/>
the back, of course. A higher ranking samurai would<br/>
probably have slightly better clothing, etc, because<br/>
of better economic status (larger fief). On the<br/>
battlefield, he'd command more soldiers, and<br/>
commanders of sufficient rank would be allowed to have<br/>
their own standard--kind of like a flag rank officer<br/>
having his own flag in the modern military. Mostly,<br/>
though, it was just "known" who outranked whom. <br/>
<br/>
As far as facial hair goes, I'm not sure if there was<br/>
any set "you must be XX old to have a beard". I think<br/>
it was just a fashion thing--some men wore beards,<br/>
some didn't. I know that it was thought to "look<br/>
distinguished", which is why many of the higher ups<br/>
wore fake facial hair (Hideyoshi supposedly wore a<br/>
fake mustache at times). <br/>

<br/>
As an aside to nate's reply, I read (in Sampson's biography of Ieyasu, I think) that a <br/>
beard, or some degree of facial hair eased the friction of their helmet cords!<br/>
<br/>
Regardless of whether this is true or not, I also read that Ieyasu preferred his men <br/>
clean shaven, which started something of a trend which ends up something of a <br/>
dictat.<br/>

This picture, probably one of the more famous,<br/>
