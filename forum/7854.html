<h3>Samurai and swords - for Nina</h3>
by <i>thomas_tessera</i>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-893985565">Hi Nina - <br/>
<br/>
There's an interesting item from Arai Hakuseki's essay "My <br/>
Father" - whgo lived 1601-1682 and who's youth was spent "not <br/>
far removed from the days of the warring states"<br/>
<br/>
Arai Masanori was put in charge of three men accused of theft, <br/>
who were to be confined to the lookout post atop the castle gate.<br/>
<br/>
Masanori asked that the three men have their swords returned, <br/>
which was granted. "Gentlemenn, if you want to escape, cut off <br/>
my head first," he said. "It's not possible for me alone to fight the <br/>
three of you. This means my own swords are useless." So <br/>
saying, he tied up his swords and dropped them out of the <br/>
gatehouse.<br/>
<br/>
After 10 or so days, he was convinced of their innocence. They <br/>
werew deemed unfit for service, however, and dismissed.<br/>
<br/>
When the time came for them to leave, they approached <br/>
Masanori:<br/>
<br/>
"How unspeakably worthless did out master find us, that he <br/>
should put us in the hands of one man? We must mnake him <br/>
realise our worth, we thought, but if we killed you when you <br/>
weren't even carrying your swords, he would conclude we were <br/>
worthless after all, and that pained us. So we decided, if we were <br/>
put to death, that weould be that."<br/>
<br/>
"As it turned out, because of your compassion we were not <br/>
deprived of our swords, and now we can mingle among samurai <br/>
once again."<br/>
<br/>
I think the point here is that the self-view of the samurai was <br/>
perceived according to his social status, nothing to do with any <br/>
notion of the 'sword as his soul', rather more to do with the fact of <br/>
how the world will view a man who lets his property be taken <br/>
from him - it's a matter of pride, not virtue.<br/>
<br/>
Somewhere else I read of a samurai who commented, quite <br/>
innocently, about the sharpness of his sword. Another rounded <br/>
on him angrily. "How dare you! Are you suggesting that my sword <br/>
is not sharp?" This kind of comment could easily lead to <br/>
bloodshed, for the most stupid reasons - too much testosterone <br/>
pumping all the time!<br/>
<br/>
Saya-ate - scabbard clashing - was an insult  beyond all <br/>
apology. The only accceptable response was a drawn sword. <br/>
Why? Because it's akin to bumping into someone, which means <br/>
you didn't even notice them.<br/>
<br/>
The 'yahoo' boys (especially in Edo and later) would wear their <br/>
swords in scarlet scabbards that stuck out almost horizontally to <br/>
the side, and then try and clash with someone. The wise heads, <br/>
who wore their swords facing as near as possible forward, so <br/>
the scabbard sticks out behind, could grasp the guard, and in a <br/>
twisting motion lift it to the shoulder, so the sword runs parallel <br/>
to, and very close to, the body, thus avoiding the contact.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Sounds about right for the Edo period when there were more than a few samurai <br/>
who had nothing to do other than start fights over their status symbols i.e. <br/>
their swords. Such as when one scabbard rubbed against another. <br/>
<br/>
Those who don't learn from history are doomed to repeat it.  In many places, <br/>
especially in gangster culture (at least here in the U.S. but I'm sure that <br/>
it's like this all over the world), when one of the home-boys "gets in your <br/>
face" i.e. touches another home-boy, this is cause for a challenge. Only in the <br/>
current day, guns rather than swords are frequently drawn. <br/>
<br/>
The more things change, the more they stay the same. <br/>
<br/>
There's an old Zen sword story I read, about Tsukahara Bokkuden, the master <br/>
swordsman of around the 16th century (I believe; please correct me if I have <br/>
this time wrong).  There are various versions, but this is the one I'm familiar <br/>
with. It seems that some blustering swordsman challenged Bokkuden to a duel. <br/>
They happened to be on the bank of a wide river and a boat was tied up nearby. <br/>
Bokkuden announced that he had a technique, it's called "the School of No <br/>
Sword" The other swordsman was astounded and didn't believe that such a technique <br/>
would work. But Bokkuden put his swords down on the nearby boat that was tied <br/>
up.  He faced his opponent without his swords. His opponent charged him, <br/>
whereupon Bokkuden jumped into the boat and rowed away, leaving his opponent <br/>
stewing upon the shore.  <br/>
