<h3>Re: Shinto Munen ryu</h3>
by <i>thomas5403</i>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1122463872">Hi Kyle - <br/>
<br/>
Not sure how much you know, so forgive if I'm 'teaching you to <br/>
suck eggs'.<br/>
<br/>
The Shindo Munen Ryu was founded by Fukui Heiemon <br/>
Yoshihira who based his teachings on the Shinkage Ryu, <br/>
the Shinkage Ichien Ryu, and the Ichien Ryu.<br/>
<br/>
Saito Yakuro (1799-1872), a Shindo Munen Ryu swordsman <br/>
Negishi Shingoro, who later taught Nakayama Hakudo <br/>
(both of whom are pictured on the website Paul provided the <br/>
link for).<br/>
<br/>
Now it gets tricky...<br/>
<br/>
In the 20th century Oe Masamichi Shikei (1852-1927) and <br/>
Nakayama Hakudo Hiromichi (1869-1958) reorganised and <br/>
modified the curriculum of a number of koryu styles. <br/>
Both were in the line of Hayashizaki Jinsuke Shigenobu's <br/>
(1542-1621) Shimmei Muso Ryu, from which a large <br/>
number of ryuha sprang.<br/>
<br/>
Oe taught the Muso Jikkiden Eishin Ryu, (Eishin was the 8th <br/>
headmaster of the Shimmei Muso Ryu) whilst Hakudo's <br/>
reformed ryu was named by his students the Muso Shinden <br/>
Ryu, hinting at its roots in the Shimmei Muso Ryu.<br/>
<br/>
Hakudo gathered techniques of (at least) three ryu as just one <br/>
style, distinguished by the name Shoden, Chuden and Okuden.<br/>
<br/>
Shoden is based on Omori ryu, founded by Omori <br/>
Rokurosaemon Masamitsu, a swordman of the Yagyu Shinkage <br/>
ryu, itself a development of Kage Ryu, Tenshin Shoden Katori <br/>
Shinto Ryu and  Kashima Shinto Ryu techniques.<br/>
<br/>
(Omori had also studied under Hasegawa Chikaranosuke <br/>
Eishin Hidenobu but was thrown out over a personal conflict.)<br/>
<br/>
Chuden is based on Muso Jikiden ryu, founded by a Onkeibo <br/>
Chohen of which very little is known. Izasa Ienao (1486-1588), <br/>
founder of Tenshin Shoden Katori Shinto ryu, is said to have <br/>
been 7th headmaster of this school. The 19th headmaster, <br/>
Hasegawa Chikaranosuke Eishin Hidenobu, was also 7th <br/>
headmaster of Hayashizaki's Shimmei Muso ryu. He taught <br/>
both styles under the name of Muso Jikiden Eishin ryu or <br/>
Hasegawa Eishin ryu. <br/>
<br/>
Okuden is directly attributed to Hayashizaki Jinsuke Shigenobu, <br/>
ie we have gone full circle, but the masters of the Shimmei <br/>
Muso Ryu also founded their own ryu, so it's likely they have <br/>
influenced the ryu since its foundation.<br/>
<br/>
Shimmei Muso Ryu masters include Tamiya Heibei Shigemasu, <br/>
the founder of the Tamiya Ryu, the Shin Tamiya Ryu, Jikyo Ryu <br/>
and Mugai Ryu. Nagano Muraku founded the Muraku Ryu. <br/>
Ichinomiya Sadayu Terunobu founded the Ichinomiya Ryu.<br/>
<br/>
Thus Hakudo would have been influenced by all these ryu in <br/>
passing on his own teachings.<br/>
<br/>
As to the curriculum of the Shindo Munen Ryu, I cannot say, but <br/>
it teaches iaijutsu, kenjutsu and jojutsu. From the photos one <br/>
might discern that their techniques are closer to -jutsu than <br/>
-do styles, that is they are more concerned with combative <br/>
technique than aesthetic style.<br/>
<br/>
(A very broad and inaccurate description of the difference <br/>
between -jutsu and -do is that in the former anything goes, <br/>
spitting, gouging, scratching, kicking and punching - the point <br/>
being to bring your opponent down. It doesn't have to be neat <br/>
and tidy, just effective - as someone once said, 'any landing <br/>
you walk away from is a good landing'.)<br/>
