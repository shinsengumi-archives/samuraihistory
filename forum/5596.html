In 'Samurai,' a master of swords loses his grip<br/>
Posted on Fri, Sep. 24, 2004<br/>
Story of dogged family man at end of humble career will touch you<br/>
<br/>
LAWRENCE TOPPMAN<br/>
<br/>
Movie Critic<br/>
<br/>
"Twilight Samurai" must be the first film about a martial artist <br/>
where nobody raises a sword for 45 minutes. It offers only one <br/>
extended duel: bloody and stumbling, full of accidental mishaps, <br/>
probably very much like a swordfight would really be. This quiet, <br/>
expressive Oscar nominee for best foreign film is a character study, <br/>
and the Japanese title -- "Tasogare Seibei," or "Twilight Seibei" -- <br/>
describes it better.<br/>
<br/>
That's the nickname given to widower Seibei Iguchi (Hiroyuki Sanada) <br/>
by his co-workers in the storehouse of a Japanese warlord: When they <br/>
go out for drinks at dusk, he rushes home to two young daughters and <br/>
a mother with Alzheimer's disease.<br/>
<br/>
The nickname applies to him for two other reasons. He's in the <br/>
twilight of his career as a fighter, having lost the fire that made <br/>
him instructor in a famous dojo, and the twilight of the samurai era <br/>
has settled upon Japan in the 1860s. A scene where the warlord's <br/>
minions comically deal with new rifles gives Iguchi a grim clue to <br/>
the future of swordsmen like himself.<br/>
<br/>
If this smells like "The Last Samurai," fear not: No iron-jawed <br/>
American sails in to save the day, and director Yoji Yamada doesn't <br/>
make grand Hollywood gestures. (Coincidentally, Sanada appeared <br/>
in "Last Samurai" as Ujio, a short-lived battler.) Yamada wrote <br/>
the "Twilight Samurai" script with Yoshitaka Asama, adapting stories <br/>
by Shuhei Fujisawa, and they entwine a love story with a crisis of <br/>
honor and responsibility.<br/>
<br/>
Iguchi, a self-described "petty samurai" at the bottom of the <br/>
retainers' pecking order, does his own housework, tends his small <br/>
plot of land and builds insect cages to collect extra money. He <br/>
believes no woman could joyfully share this life, including <br/>
childhood friend Tomoe Iinuma (Rie Miyazawa). Even after he protects <br/>
her from a beating by a drunken ex-husband, Iguchi can't accept her <br/>
gratitude or her brother's suggestion that they marry.<br/>
<br/>
Meanwhile, his bosses find a use for his rusty skills. A great old <br/>
swordfighter, unfairly blamed for a trumped-up "failure" and told to <br/>
commit ritual suicide, holes up in his house. Iguchi, once a master <br/>
of the short sword, is ordered to storm that house and slay the <br/>
offender. This troubles the ethical Iguchi, who can't decide <br/>
between "duty" and the feeling that attacking this older man is <br/>
wrong.<br/>
<br/>
Only Iguchi's character gets fully fleshed out, but we feel we know <br/>
him as well as any old friend: He's loyal yet slightly stubborn, <br/>
gentle yet accomplished in destruction, humble about his deeds yet <br/>
proud with the misguided pride of a poor man who has nothing else to <br/>
cling to. Sanada gives an exceptionally detailed performance, <br/>
showing us new things even in his last scenes.<br/>
<br/>
Yamada directs with stately confidence, going no faster than he has <br/>
to but never letting us get bored. Even modest moments have payoffs: <br/>
Iguchi sharpens a sword at night, awakening his curious 5-year-old, <br/>
or fishes with Tomoe's brother (Mitsuru Fukikoshi), until the <br/>
corpses of two starved peasants float past.<br/>
<br/>
Yamada has spent most of his 40-year career directing the tales of <br/>
Tora-san, a vain but comically lovable drifter, through nearly four <br/>
dozen films. With "Samurai," faced at 71 with what may have been the <br/>
most challenging project of his career, he blossomed like a gnarled <br/>
cherry tree exploding in flowers on the last day of spring.<br/>
