       Coming from a former Blockbuster employee, in my humble opinion, not <br/>
many movies are worth the price to rent them unless it's a whim or you just <br/>
HAFTA see them.  And there aren't too many in THAT category.  (Granted, and <br/>
admittedly, I'm not a movie fan, though.  For instance, I didn't see A Clockwork <br/>
Orange -- I read the book by the late Anthony Burgess.  Beyond that, name a <br/>
major movie and I probably haven't seen it.)  :-)<br/>

It had shown its military capability, both naval and on land, during the Russo-Japanese War, but effectively ganged-up upon by the more mature diploatic powers, Japan received nothing from the War other than, in many poltical and military circles, a revanchist attitude not too dissimilar to the French Right and Left of the Third Republic between 1871-1914. Driven as much by this attitude of pride and a stubborn willingness to ignore the obvious, Japan's leadership willingly blundered into the War, succeeding in antagonizing the USA, the UK, and a host of other colonizers and dominions, aswell China. The same lack of forethought that drove them against the NT of Australia (were they going to march to Adelaide down The Track??) was what kept them going. <br/>
And at this stage of tragic proceedings, would the Allies have negotiated a settlement if the Japanese had appeared willing. American attitudes were akin to those of more recent years; an attack on the American nation, state, and way of life. Roosevelt was in little doubt that revenge had to be taken, an attitude willingly shared by Churchill. And the Nationalists or Communists in China? <br/>
Perhaps by comparing this to the samurai spirit is degrading the samurai. While samurai armies were composed of a corps of trusted retainers and 'captains', the majority, whether ashigaru were samurai, were agriculturalists.  Wars were generally fought around the agricultural calendar. Their loyalty ran to what was at stake; their property. There were few mass suicides or massive 'bloodbath' battles, the daimyo and their troops had more sense; more often than not a daimyo surrendered and in return was confirmed in his estates, upon condition of loyalty. Perhaps in the Japanese High Command in 1943/44 should have done the same to save themselves, rather than pursuing an impossible dream in the remodelled spirit of the samurai.That's just my opinion anyways.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1714074198">I think that the Japanese were doing a good job of controlling their gains in the war up until the turning point of the war at Midway, <br/>
which they lost more because of their naval codes being cracked than to any other factor. After Midway I think that they fought on because they still held hope for a major victory. They were far behind in the development of radar and sonar, but they had advantages in torpedoes, biological warfare, and Japanese navy was the best in the world in night warfare. And of course there was the great hope that the kamakaze would bring them a victory. After it was clear that these things had failed I think that most were resolved to die for the emperor rather than surrender, look at what happend on Saipan, Okinawa and Iwojima. Had the home islands themselves been invaded much the same would have happend.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-910037870">Dear Cesare:<br/>
Despite the place I was born, the Pacific campaign<br/>
during World War Two was not my interests. I was more<br/>
into the European campaign.<br/>
Anyway, with my humble opinion, first of all, the<br/>
Japanese soldires were cut off from their mainland<br/>
once the Americans started to gain the naval and air<br/>
superiority. There was no way to transfer their units<br/>
back to the main strategical points fast enough. They<br/>
also underesmated the American industrial power which<br/>
enabled her to replenish what was lost in the Pearl<br/>
harbor.<br/>
<br/>
As for the room for the diplomacy, I doubt that<br/>
neither Americans nor the British accept any terms<br/>
other than the unconditional surrender. One point can<br/>
be made with an analogy with Italian surrender,<br/>
Howerver there were more military and political values<br/>
from securing the Italian surrendor such as the<br/>
logistical surplus for the Eastern frontier, the<br/>
postwar control of the Eastern Europe, and etc. The<br/>
presence of the democratic Chinese government<br/>
probabily did not cause any alarm to Americans with<br/>
regard to the political composition of the Asian<br/>
countries after the war.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>

Change in Japan means institutional change and institutional change <br/>
comes nowhere slower than in Japan...<br/>
<br/>
The military and political leaders all had the evidence but no one <br/>
group and no one person was prepared to go against the grain, and  get <br/>
crushed under the wheels of a war machine that had taken on a life of <br/>
it's own. It took the word of an Emperor to stop it.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1308717957">I feel that Japan was forced into war by the US - the invasion of Hawaii and<br/>
the trade embargoes all lead to Japan having the choice of:<br/>

1. giving into america and doing as they were told<br/>
or<br/>
2. fighting back with military means<br/>
<br/>
While I do feel they could have prevented the war with diplomatic means (and<br/>
should of) I also feel that the US has to bear a good portion of the blame -<br/>
you have to remember that the Japanese people's only experience of the US<br/>
was being forced to trade at gunpoint, and the US invasion of Hawaii because<br/>
they were holding a referendum which would have made Hawaii a Japanese, not<br/>
American, state. Plus in nearby Phillipines they had seen the Americans<br/>
invade the islands and then keep it as a colony. Are they the actions of a<br/>
state that you would trust in their position?? I suppose it is little wonder<br/>
that no diplomatic solution was ever reached.<br/>

  my question: the Japanese campaign in East Asia and in the Pacific was<br/>
  clearly a hopeless hyperbole. There was NO WAY the Japanese could<br/>
  control and man such a vast area. After Guadalcanal, then, it was clear<br/>
  that the wind had changed, still there was room for diplomacy, either<br/>
  with the US and perhaps with what was left of China and the Soviets.<br/>
  But the Japanese kept fighting and dying until August 1945.<br/>
  Why?<br/>
  I have my own theories, but before throwing them on the table, I'd love<br/>
  to hear from some of you.<br/>

<h3>Re: WWII... why?</h3>
by <i>thomas5403</i>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1577190851">An askew view of how governments work - ie slightly off topic but <br/>
hopefully to show there's often currents moving which do not <br/>
bear too close an examination - ie the bad guy is not always <br/>
necessarily wholly the bad guy, nor is the good entirely <br/>
blameless) <br/>
<br/>
It might be of passing interest to note that Defence Departments <br/>
always need a boogey-man with which to frighten the <br/>
Administration of the day into increasing defence spending.<br/>
<br/>
In the wake of WWI, the US DD was casting round for a 'foreign <br/>
power' of sufficient magnitude with 'imperialistic overtones' <br/>
sufficient to pose a threat to the 'national interest' and thus <br/>
provide the means by which to threaten their administration.<br/>
<br/>
And who should they come up with . . . <br/>
<br/>
Great Britain!<br/>
<br/>
(It seems they were as ill-informed about the parlous state of <br/>
Britain's readiness for war as we were about German <br/>
preparations - one exasperated GB secret service agent, <br/>
operating in Germany, was persistently queried about his claim <br/>
regarding the existence of a factory making light machine guns - <br/>
in the end in exasperation he tore the page from a phone book <br/>
bearing the address of the company!)<br/>
<br/>
On the other hand, US govt. wanted to fund National Socialism in <br/>
Germany to get economic stability in European markets - but <br/>
didn't want to be associated with the nazi ideal. Many US <br/>
companies found interesting ways to get round it - Coca Cola <br/>
refused the export or manufacture of Coke in Germany, but they <br/>
did brand Fanta as a new drink for the German market (and not <br/>
immediately associated with Coke).<br/>
<br/>
History is often a murky business.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>The invasion of Hawaii by the US is 50 years previous to this, I don't<br/>
see what bearing this has on anything. By this point Japan has been<br/>
mucking about in Korea and China for decades and showing their talent<br/>
for colonial administration. I.E. virtually none. Previous to this they<br/>
had already attacked Americans, read up on the Panay. These actions and<br/>
others lead to the embargoes and other sanctions. Military dictatorships<br/>
don't make good neighbors and are generally poor at diplomacy.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> >I also feel that the US has to bear a good portion of the blame -<br/>

>American, state.<br/>
><br/>
 </span></blockquote>The original treaty also dealt with treating shipwrecked sailors like<br/>
humans and other things along those lines, this is close to 90 years<br/>
before, I've never heard of the referendum to make Hawaii a Japanese<br/>
state, I doubt it would have come close to passing since the number of<br/>
anglos, Hawaiians and Chinese far exceeded the number of Japanese on the<br/>
island. Even if just the Hawaiians voted, they felt they could stay an<br/>
independent country at the time. The US backed coup came as an<br/>
unpleasant surprise. P.S. Look up the difference in the US between a<br/>
territory and a state, It took about 60 years for Hawaii to become a state.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> > Plus in nearby Phillipines they had seen the Americans<br/>

>  <br/>
><br/>
 </span></blockquote>We were late to the colonial game, so we got the leftovers that the UK,<br/>
France and Germany didn't want. We should have freed them like we did<br/>
with Cuba. This still has little bearing on Japan's actions, they were<br/>
an aggressive, expansionist, military dictatorship that had set out to<br/>
conquer Asia, this would have lead to war no matter what and the US<br/>
tried diplomatic means to prevent it including not going to war over<br/>
attacking US citizens and soldiers.<br/>
<br/>
In some ways these does show samurai spirit, a bunch of bloody minded<br/>
killers who are going to take what they want and only understand force<br/>
as an argument. Which makes them no different from their European<br/>
counterparts.<br/>

<br/>
I think Tristan might be right with the annex of Hawaii to Japan.  <br/>
According to the book "Stolen Kingdom", the Hawaiian monarchy had <br/>
asked Japan for the referndum.  Several years prior, Hawaii had asked <br/>
the US to be a territory (but still a sovreign state) but the US <br/>
refused, twice.  Primarily because the US didn't see any benefit in <br/>
it.  Hawaii was being bullied around.  Although, Hawaii was its own <br/>
country, the Hawaiian military was not strong enough to stand up to <br/>
the super powers of that time.  Treaties were being forced upon them <br/>
that put Hawaiians at a severe disadvantage.  Hawaii needed to align <br/>
itself with another country in order to retain its sovriegnty.  Since <br/>
the US had refused and the Monarchy thought a Pacific alliance would <br/>
strengthen the dying Hawaiian bloodline, they asked Japan.<br/>
<br/>
I don't think it was a ploy to push Japan's buttons.  I don't even <br/>
think annexing Hawaii was a US decision.  The decision belonged to <br/>
one man, Dole (think pineapples).  A rich landowner who decided he <br/>
needed to protect his property in Hawaii.  So he (having the support <br/>
of most US Marines on Oahu) decided to storm the Palace.  The actions <br/>
were illegal and unconstitutional but resulted in the statehood of <br/>
Hawaii.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>While I certainly DON'T hold the US blameless on many things the gov't has <br/>
done over the years, note the Phillipines were a protectorate controlled by <br/>
the US AFTER a war with Spain. The embargoes were an attempt to stop Japan's <br/>
aggressive expansionist campaign in Asia (Korea, Manchukuo ring any bells?).<br/>
  The Japanese of today are NOT the japanese on 70 years ago. Japan at that <br/>
time was controlled by a ruthless military. A military that controlled the <br/>
schools in order to indoctrinate children. A military that was quite willing <br/>
to sacrifice EVERYONE (crushing the jewels was the common euphemism), not to <br/>
protect the Emperor but to save face. The same commanders who would command <br/>
soldiers to fight to the death then flee the battlefield.<br/>

I saw a Forum that had 2 parts:1.Discussions about Need for Speed(a racing game)<br/>
                                             2.Off-topic discussions<br/>
<br/>
I think we should create 2 parts of the Forum and if the members are interested they should sign for it too.<br/>
