I completely understand what you mean, being a Kenjutsu & Kendo teacher, I have done some integrate study into this matter.<br/>
In Japanese fencing (Kendo), the left hand is the stronger of the two..and are often forgotten by practitioners...The left maintain center, co-ordination, motion and balance. The teachings of some martial forms actually cultivate the usage of both left and right, there should be no strong and weak side, that's why a technique have Hidari & Migi. If ones' lefthanded it is of great advantage in Kendo, especialy in the Jodan Kamae forms...there the left need to execute a Men with accuracy and speed..whereas the rightys will try and throw it...where the left cut.<br/>
In Kenjutsu, balance is of utmost importance as you know.....Balance of the spheres in respect to Left and Right movements. I was asked by a denshi which hand are much stronger, and best to use in Kenjutsu and I said "Yes".<br/>
The body parts works together as a unit of efficiency and organized motion. The Left...is of vital importance, so if someone's left-handed..less cultivation in co-ordination is needed But!!!..this must be remembered..once the practitioner utilize strength..left or not..such technique and motion become no good..the essence aspect of Kenjutsu is application for the blade is sharp enough..so no strength is needed....only technique in application of form.<br/>
There is one technique that can outmove any righty....due to the consistant use of the left throughout the leftys life....that hand with the eye and motion of efficiency are oiled for a faster response.<br/>
That technique is common in Kenjutsu teaching, and can be seen at the very end of Kurusawas movie Yojimbo....Before the uchidashi could draw with his right..Yojimbo drew his blade with the left and guided it with the right through the opponents chest under the arm cavity.<br/>

 Well, there would be a problem if a lefty and righty where engaged <br/>
in a battle where the weapon had not yet been drawn, such as within <br/>
Iaido. But even with that the first person to draw often wins. Also <br/>
due to the crossing of bodies lefty drawing from right and righty <br/>
from left. Though there is one attack that it difficult drawing from <br/>
saya in R is the strike down to the left, as it is hard to get the <br/>
blade all the way clear of the body. Where as the L doesn't have that <br/>
trouble.<br/>
<br/>
But within something like Kendo, where the sword, shinai is already <br/>
drawn such thing would perhaps be an advantage( at the moment I am <br/>
blanking on weither or not one puts the dominant hand closest to <br/>
Tsuba or not). There is also the question of phycological aspect, <br/>
often, at least within styles of European fencing with both live and <br/>
pratice weapons, one's adversary often goes for the hand they would <br/>
use to fight with. As there are more rightys fighting rightys the <br/>
obvious thing would be go for that hand/Arm.<br/>
<br/>
I also wonder if it is considered dishonorable to have the left be <br/>
the domainant hand( though I think Deo-san already covered that) I am <br/>
grateful for your advise and words.<br/>

	I have read that the true "secret" of Yagyu Shinkage-ryu was <br/>
that in the advanced level you change your stance and grip to that of <br/>
a lefty. This changes the distance between opponents and confuses the <br/>
righty as he is used to fighting other righties.<br/>
	 During Tokugawa times left-handedness likely would have been <br/>
an impediment to ones career so discouraged. During the sengoku <br/>
uniform movement of large groups of men would have required <br/>
left-handedness to be trained out of a soldier as it is today I <br/>
believe. However, in this same era  if one were born of sufficient <br/>
rank you might have been allowed to be a lefty especially if it meant <br/>
you excelled at the martial arts. Standing out on the battlefield was <br/>
what one wanted unlike today (nails and all...). Though I have yet to <br/>

I have been doing iaido for a number of years,and i`m left handed,i <br/>
dont have a problem with drawing the sword out of the saya or <br/>
returning the sword back in,i have read a lot about babys being born <br/>
in japan who have had the left arm tied down so that the child can <br/>
not use the left arm,and then is made to use the right.<br/>
I have not heard of a left handed samurai but then i dont know all <br/>
there is to know about the samurai,maybe some one else here can help <br/>
more than me.<br/>
All i wanted to do is to say it is possible to be left handed and <br/>

	The question is do you where your sword on the right hip? Is <br/>
your dominant hand closest to the tsuba? As was noted if your wear <br/>
and wield the sword as a righty then you have an advantage (use of <br/>
the left hand is key in Japanese swordsmanship). If your sword is on <br/>
your right hip, aren't you forever committing saya-ate?<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Thats a good question,i should have answered that in my first post.<br/>
ok,i wear my sword on my left side,and yes my dominant hand is on the <br/>
suba,i`m not so sure it would give me much adavantage,it would depend <br/>
who you was facing at the time.<br/>
And yes you would be right,had my sword been on my right side,i would <br/>
be commiting saya-ate,i dont think that being left handed make`s a <br/>
lot of difference really,i have tried drawing the sword useing my <br/>
left hand,and to be honest i found it very difficult and i could not <br/>
resheath the blade afterwards,but thats just me,you may well get <br/>
different replys from other people.<br/>
Hope that helps you ....dave</div>
