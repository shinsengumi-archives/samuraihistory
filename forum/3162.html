STATE OF WAR: THE VIOLENT ORDER OF FOURTEENTH-CENTURY JAPAN<br/>
by Thomas Donald Conlan<br/>
A John Whitney Hall Book<br/>
<br/>
ISBN 1-929280-16-5 (cloth, $65.00), 1-9292890-23-8 (paper, $24.00)<br/>
xviii + 282 pp., 35 illustrations, 5 tables, and 22 color plates<br/>
<br/>
"Outstanding ... Tom Conlan has written an extraordinarily detailed <br/>
and thorough history of warfare in the fourteenth century from a wide <br/>
variety of perspectives, including the function of the individual <br/>
warrior in everyday battle, the number and character of casualties, <br/>
the logistics of warfare, loyalty among warriors, and fighting as a <br/>
sacred pursuit. STATE OF WAR makes a powerful contention that <br/>
militarization was the principal force in the molding of fourteenth-<br/>
century Japan."<br/>
Paul Varley Sen Soshitsu XV Professor of Japanese Cultural History<br/>
University of Hawaii at Manoa<br/>
<br/>
"This exciting book is a landmark in the study of premodern Japanese<br/>
history. Informed by easy mastery of a wide range of largely untapped<br/>
primary sources and thoughtful conceptualization, Professor Conlan has<br/>
produced the most comprehensive study of warfare for any period of<br/>
Japanese history. It is the first serious study of how warriors <br/>
actually engaged in battle, and of the full range of logistic, <br/>
intellectual, and religious factors that surround their lives; to his <br/>
credit, the author conveys well the human side of the story. The <br/>
author's attention to issues of social change and technology is <br/>
particularly welcome and should inspire others to address these <br/>
matters in other periods of Japanese history. Readers will also <br/>
appreciate the fluid writing style."<br/>
<br/>
Andrew Goble<br/>
Associate Professor of History<br/>
University of Oregon<br/>
<br/>
STATE OF WAR, a path-breaking study of the transformative power of <br/>
war and its profound influence on fourteenth-century Japan, presents <br/>
a fundamental revision of Japanese history. By illuminating Japan <br/>
through the lens of war, Thomas Conlan provides insight into how <br/>
state and society functioned, as opposed to how they were portrayed <br/>
in ideal. Conlan recreates the experience of war from the perspective <br/>
of one warrior, and then reconstructs how war was fought through <br/>
statistical analysis of surviving casualty records.<br/>
STATE OF WAR also shows that the battles of the fourteenth century<br/>
mark a watershed in Japanese history. The fiscal exigencies of waging <br/>
war led to a devolution of political power to the provinces. <br/>
Furthermore, the outbreak of war caused social status to become <br/>
performative, based upon the ability to fight autonomously, rather <br/>
than being prescriptive, or determined by edicts of investiture.<br/>
This work bridges the intellectual gulf between the fourteenth and<br/>
twentieth centuries by exploring how the seemingly contradictory<br/>
categories of religion and war were integrally related. The <br/>
fourteenth-century belief that the outcome of battle was determined <br/>
by the gods meant that religious institutions warred both ritually and<br/>
physically, and that religious attitudes frequently underpinned <br/>
warrior behavior.<br/>
Based on diverse sources, including documents, picture scrolls,<br/>
medical and religious texts, and chronicles, STATE OF WAR <br/>
rehabilitates warfare as a focal point of historical inquiry and <br/>
provides a fascinating new overview of premodern Japanese history.</div>

longer, you could always just order the book from the University press <br/>
(Michigan if I'm not mistaken).  I have always gotten books in a timely <br/>
fashion from the university presses (Stanford, Yale, Michigan) that I have <br/>
ordered from.<br/>
