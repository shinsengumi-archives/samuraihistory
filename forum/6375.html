every Ninjutsu instructor out there from Frank Dux to Shoto <br/>
Tanamura, to Hatsumi Sensei himself. so wheather you are Dux-Ryu, <br/>

thoughts people may have of you being staff on this<br/>
email list. Your declaration that you "will hear<br/>
nothing more on the matter" indicates you'll stop<br/>
taking emails in case people write about it? <br/>
<br/>
This isn't necessarily off-topic, though as noted if<br/>
people study history then people like Hayes and<br/>
Hatsumi are irrelevant at best, kooks at worst. So the<br/>
discussion will continue if people wish to continue<br/>
it, Ms. Antenucci's opinion notwithstanding. I<br/>
recommend you put a block on the word 'ninja' in your<br/>
email software--I would, but it would seriously<br/>
inhibit my abilities to moderate. <br/>

 </span></blockquote>Several noble youths from Kyushu families were sent in<br/>
the 1580's. They went to Portugal, Spain, and Italy,<br/>
and were received by the Pope. I'm sure if you did a<br/>
google search you could find most of the details.<br/>
Sansom covers it in his volume 2, and there are<br/>
several other sources out there. And interesting read<br/>
would be "The Samurai" by Endo Shusaku--fictional<br/>
account of a samurai journeying to Europe.<br/>

samurai, just with specialized training, simmilar to our special <br/>
forces. I think it would also be funny if they used roughly the same  <br/>
exact weapons as the samurai, give or take 1 or 2. I would also laugh <br/>
too if they didn't wear black but dressed like the enemy to blend in,  <br/>
and not be found out by a guard saying "Who is that in the black <br/>
pajamas with a sword, coming towards us?"<br/>
<br/>
Guard 2: "I don't know, we could just kill him then ask." <br/>
<br/>

<br/>
Guard 1: "Who is that in the black pajamas with a sword, coming towards us?"<br/>
Guard 2: "what is a pajamas?" <br/>
<br/>
I don't think at those times they even knew what is a pajama (not making a<br/>
pun on spelling I don't know how's spelled myself) personally I don't<br/>
really belive ninjas even existed at all. but still it's silly consider<br/>
silly the way they are depicted to dress... to us with our culture sounds<br/>
silly.. at the time and wif a different culture might look scary who knows<br/>
:D in japanese and chinese mythology there are alot of funny looking<br/>
creatures, yet japanese never considered them funny at all...<br/>

Well, Hayes CLAIMS he was, anyway. He is uncredited and the detailed <br/>
list of cast & crew (including stunt personnel) I have gives no mention <br/>
of him. The only other place I've ever seen it mentioned was in an <br/>
interview with Hayes (of course) in Kick magazine back in the 80's <br/>
where among other things he claims to have been living in Japan for <br/>
years, given the Shogun production crew ninja history and choreography <br/>
for the ninja attack sequence, and just totally impressed the whole <br/>
crew with his grasp of Japanese history and martial arts. The part he <br/>
was supposed to have played was a stuntman part-the crewman that falls <br/>

grey haired, grumpy, and my knees no longer like being sat on, plus<br/>
after many years of wearing combat boots, my ankles object to bending<br/>
quite that far. And besides, it had been a long hot day and my old bones<br/>
just wanted to go flomp on the deck. And to cap it all, I'm virtually<br/>

Now, seriously, as a re-enactor of Japanese history I am forever having<br/>
to explain, that in my opinion virtually the whole "ninja" thing is pure<br/>
baloney, although I do put it more politely than that normally. Does<br/>
anyone know of a web site that deals with this topic in a genuinely<br/>
scholarly fashion? So far, all I can find are the usual crop of ninja<br/>
wanabe dojo's, or those frothing at the mouth with their pre-pubescent<br/>
fantasies, as for the rest: - silence.<br/>
<br/>
Cepo wrote that he had read mountains of books for his Phd, and not one<br/>
mention of the ninja, which to me is dam fine evidence. But what I need<br/>
to be able to point folks at is a reputable and scholarly discussion of<br/>
the subject, preferably short, putting the ninja in (or out of) their<br/>
historical context, citing the evidence one way or another. The trouble<br/>
is when I tried to write a short piece for my website, I realised, that<br/>
I'm massively unqualified to do it any kind of credible justice. So,<br/>
help!<br/>
<br/>
I suspect that there is nothing out there as this whole subject has a<br/>
pariah quality about it, meaning that to date any scholar worth their<br/>
salt, treats it like a hot potato and leaves the topic well alone! Oh<br/>
well...<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-541533763">Ok a rare post from me moment. We all seem to be getting a little off topic with the whole ninja topic. From my perspective (24yro) I find that the ninja have somewhat been given a superhero mythical status. Im a firm believer in classical arts and that the modern day version of a ninja is nothing more than a perversion of history, On one of the forums in which I moderate there a forum ninjas ( moderators) this kinda shows how to be a ninja is uber cool!! ( and trust me these guys have never even heard the word Iga ,let alone looked at ninja history)  I also believe that modern day ninja are a 20th century interpretation of what we would want them to be, almost comic book in fact. I not sure if the western worlds interpretation of ninja is directly responsable for the ninja fad,or that the ninjas own secerecy and art of deception is responsible for leaving blanks in which peoples 'poetic licence' run amuck.  <br/>

wouldn't exactly be allowed to "vanish" after<br/>
defecating on the floor of a court room, but maybe he<br/>
used his magic ninja powers. If you could find a link<br/>

those at this point. At any rate, being a guy who falls off the rigging is the <br/>
type of job that would be given to a professional stuntman, not some random guy <br/>
off the street extra. Not to mention it's hardly a claim to fame.<br/>

good fake of an MSNBC article. None of the links at<br/>
the bottom seem to work (They all direct you to<br/>
another www.bol.ucla.edu site, not to any actual MSNBC<br/>
site), and I highly doubt anyone with any sense of<br/>
journalistic pride would actually type "laid a log" in<br/>
a real story.<br/>
<br/>
Okay, maybe USA Today. <br/>
<br/>
I ran the author's name through Google, and can't come<br/>
up with anything other than this, links to the site,<br/>
and links to message boards debating whether he's for<br/>
real. (I'm excluding the numerous hits for Robert<br/>
Hamburger, genetics researcher--apparently he shares<br/>
the name, unfortunately). <br/>
<br/>
I'm going to try to check this out some more, but so<br/>
far, I'm not buying it. <br/>

Book Description<br/>
Dear Stupid Idiots, <br/>
A lot of you have been saying that I don't know anything about REAL <br/>
ninjas. But that's a bunch of bull crap! You dummies don't know <br/>
anything. And maybe YOU should get a life. I bet a lot of you have <br/>
never even seen a girl naked! You idiots believe that ninjas had <br/>
some "code of honor." Yeah right! If by "code of honor," you <br/>
mean "code to flip out and go nuts for absolutely no reason at all <br/>
even if it means that people might think you are totally insane or <br/>
sweet," then you are right. But if you mean a "code to be nice and <br/>
speak nicely while sharing and not cutting off heads," then you're <br/>
the biggest idiot ever!!!!!! So if you have any brains, you will <br/>
shut up and get a life. So go shut up, you stupid idiot. <br/>
<br/>
No thank you, <br/>
<br/>
Robert Hamburger <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Review:<br/>
<br/>
Ever have an obsession when you were a kid? Something you loved so <br/>
much that you couldn't stop talking about it to anyone and everyone? <br/>
Multiply that by 100 and you get Robert Hamburger, the fictional <br/>
author/protagonist of the book. While the book is primarily made up <br/>
of the same material that is posted on the website, the true point <br/>
of the book is hidden in it's footnotes. Through conversations with <br/>
his babysitter/co-writer, dog, parents and psychologist, we follow <br/>
Robert's story and delve into the psyche of a pretty messed up <br/>
little kid. What a lot of people dont seem to get is that the book, <br/>
like the site, isn't actually about Ninjas. It's not REALLY a ninja <br/>
hand guide, or a history lesson. The point isnt to educate, the <br/>
point is to tell the story of a troubled kid who buries himself in a <br/>
ninja fantasy in order to escape his negligant parents, over-<br/>
critical teachers and to compensate for his lack of friends. As a <br/>
kid we all had times when we wished we could run away to the circus, <br/>
or could go live in outer space, or whatever, because we felt like <br/>
we couldn't indentify with anyone.. this book is simply the story of <br/>
a kid going through that kind of period in his life. And for <br/>
everyone that claims that the website and the book may cause kids <br/>
to "flip out and kill each other," I believe that the book actually <br/>
encourages the exact opposite. Robert is facsinated with killing and <br/>
violence because it's what he wants to do to the people that have <br/>
hurt him in his life, or he wants to find a ninja friend to do it... <br/>
hell, we've seen children and young adults in this situation before <br/>
a few years back, and we've seen the consequences of such pent up <br/>
anger. This book is not an advocate of violence, but a warning as to <br/>
what can happen when we try to force kids to abandon childish <br/>
things, pump them full of medicine and "discipline" in order to make <br/>
them grow up fast, rather than encourage them to be silly, dream and <br/>
savor every momment of their childhood. I for one did not expect <br/>
this level of complexity in this book, but I was totally floored <br/>
after finishing it. Comedy, especially parody, has always been the <br/>
best forum for social commentary, and this book masters it. If you <br/>
hate the site, or if you don't get it, spend the $10 and read the <br/>
book and I'm pretty sure you'll change your opinion. This book is <br/>
genius: and by genius, I mean totally sweet.</div>

Adults spending their time on this sort of thing? I didn't know the age of the person but as I mentioned before now it makes more sense. Only a child would spend their time on that sort of thing.

 </span></blockquote>You had to hunt it down, because it's not REAL. It's<br/>
hosted off the UCLA website, which leads me to believe<br/>
it's the creation of one or more UCLA students, as a<br/>
joke. NOTHING comes up on the MSNBC site if you look<br/>
for anything related to this. <br/>
<br/>
Not only is the website a parody, but all this<br/>
business about being in court and defecating is ALSO a<br/>
parody/joke. My only question is this: is it the same<br/>
person/people as those who created the site, or is it<br/>
someone making their own spinoff to the saga?<br/>
<br/>
*sigh*<br/>
<br/>
And people get upset when I lament the failure of<br/>
today's youth to grasp irony... <br/>

That is a fact I can not speak for any other place but if you guys really want something to do and I know a few of you have and thats get the word of the truth out there but then again people will belive what they want to believe huh.
