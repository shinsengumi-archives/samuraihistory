Whilst I would agree with some, and I do make some critisism at times, that <br/>
his work is not perhaps 100% academic, contains some errors and does suffer <br/>
from a degree of repetition, it has never the less provided a firm <br/>
foundation over the past 25 years for the "samurai enthusiasts".<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> ><br/>
>Stephen had an interest in Japan and the Far East from his early days and <br/>
 </span></blockquote>this no doubt helped him in his studies at Cambridge University and <br/>
obtaining a Doctorate from Leeds with his thesis on the Hidden Christians <br/>
of Japan. He has ben a member of the Japan Society for many years and is <br/>
currently an Honorary Research Fellow at the Department of East Asian <br/>
Studies at the University of Leeds.  So on one point a small correction, he <br/>
is associated with a great university..  He is also associated with the <br/>
Samurai Gallery of the UK National Armouries and has acted as consultant to <br/>
the BBC, The History Channel and "Shogun" anmongst others...<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> ><br/>
>I first met Stephen in the early seventies when he and I were both members <br/>
 </span></blockquote>of the North Cheshire Military Modelling Society, there his infectious <br/>
enthusiasm for the topic made me a convert. We still occassionally bump <br/>
into each other up and down the country. His first book on the samurai <br/>
published in 1977, "The Samurai: A Military History" was a mammoth task for <br/>
those days and ignited a thirst for knowledge on the subject in the UK .<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> ><br/>
>My own reasonably extensive library has over 20 Turnbull publications on <br/>
 </span></blockquote>various aspects of the samurai competing for space with books in japanese, <br/>
german, french, italian and polish as well as many others in english.  I <br/>
have much respect for Stephen in that he "put pen to paper" and put "his <br/>
head above the parapet!" (how's that for mixed metaphors...). It is almost <br/>
a standing joke between us that my book has yet to come to fruition - but <br/>
then I am an engineer!<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> ><br/>
>I would recommend that you view his website and perhaps obtain a couple of <br/>
 </span></blockquote>the books from a library before you decide to purchase your first... I am <br/>
presently making my way through the two great volumes of collected papers <br/>
in his editorial work "The Samurai Tradition"  {published cost over „Äç200}<br/>

  Not to nitpick....but if the English author that you are referring to is <br/>
  Shakespeare, I believe it was:<br/>
