<div id="ygrps-yiv-345760605">Hi!<br/>
 I'm 25 % Japenese.  My mom was born at the foot of Mt. Fuji and <br/>
lived there until she was 8. My grandmother was a fascinating women <br/>
who stayed very true to her culture.  Before she died, I remember <br/>
her talking of some kind of history of Samurai in her family.  Is <br/>
there any way I can find out if it was true?  It's not that I doubt <br/>
her honesty, it's just that she was sick in the end, and not as <br/>
sharp as before.  Her Japenese name was Akiko Takeuchi.  I think I <br/>
spelled that right.  Any help would be appriecated!</div>

Since this is a "history" list, there is likely no one here who can <br/>
assist your search. You'll need to check genealogical sites or perhaps <br/>
the San Francisco Japanese-American  History Archives. Now if you want <br/>
to learn more about what that heritage means check out;<br/>
