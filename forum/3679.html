YO DUDE PICK UP ANY TEXT ON JAPANESE HISTORY AND READ ABOUT THE ENRYAKU-JI !!!!!<br/>
They were for generations before the europeans came a huge military power.They wore armour had swords, spears, naginata and every other weapon available to the samurai. They were just as well trained as the samurai were. They had a standing army of men who were monk in name only and who had a long history of using military threats and action for reasons that had nothing to do with religion! Now if I am wrong I will be the first to admit it but in tthis case it is you who are wrong.<br/>
