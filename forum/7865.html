<div id="ygrps-yiv-270047491">Well, to speak about christin samurais could be such a<br/>
large thing. Anyway. First of all to say that the<br/>
history of christianity in the samurai period begins<br/>
with the arrival of Saint Francis Xavier to Kagoshima<br/>
at 1548, until the banning of christianity by Tokugawa<br/>
at 1612. Only 70 years. The first daimyo to be<br/>
converted was Omura Sumitada, but before this one,<br/>
other daimyos had granted privileges to the catholic<br/>
church, if by nothing else, to get advantages in the<br/>
commerce with Portugal. Ouchi is a clear example of<br/>
that, the ever very merchantilistic ouchis.<br/>
Other daimyos received baptism, I think that all from<br/>
jesuits hands. Their major expansion was before the<br/>
Sekigahara Battle. The christian daimyos was a strong<br/>
force in the council that ruled the country after<br/>
Hideyoshi`s death.<br/>
Well, other people could say more thing... <br/>
<br/>
I had been working in an article about history of the<br/>
catholic church in Japan, if you are interested,<br/>
although it is in spanish.<br/>
