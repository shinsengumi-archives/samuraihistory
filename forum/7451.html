 </span></blockquote>I have both books. I haven't read 'The Last Shogun' yet (right now<br/>
i'm reading "A History of Japan, 1615-1867") but "The Last Samurai" <br/>
is an excellent book. It describes Saigo Takamori's life and the War <br/>
of the Southwest (also known as the Satsuma Rebellion). It's <br/>
interesting to note that Saigo used several names when corresponding <br/>
with other people. One of the names Saigo Takamori used when writing <br/>
poetry was 'Saigo Nanshû' which means Saigo of the South. With<br/>
this name Saigo refers to the Southern Court (Go-Daigo's Southern <br/>
line). Torn between truly unifying (under the Emperor) and <br/>
modernizing Japan and his loyalty towards the ideals of the samurai <br/>
class and his Lord Shimazu, Saigo's life was interesting indeed.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1406708465">A RESPONSE; Thanks for the info and such; I love Japanese History and such.<br/>
Will begin to read both books soon; as soon as I am done with the others.<br/>
Japanese History is fascinating and their culture just as interesting; on my<br/>
top five list of favorite literature to read.<br/>
