 </span></blockquote>??? I agree with one of these points.<br/>
<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Since Japanese armor seems highly flexible, with a large amount of <br/>
adjustment, they obviously thought that fit was important. I think that <br/>
any of the reenacting types that have used reproductions of both <br/>
probably don't feel much difference in that. Also I don't think it would <br/>
be possible in summer to fight in Japan using European armor. You would <br/>
die from the heat.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>I really doubt that, I suspect the craftsmen built the best of what was <br/>
wanted. The Japanese were fine workers of metal in period.<br/>

><br/>
 </span></blockquote>No, but I don't think they would have ever used full plate because of <br/>
thier climate. Trained knights swooned and died in armor in 60-70 degree <br/>
weather, what would happen at 95+?<br/>

 </span></blockquote>While leather was used in armor, one hell of a lot of iron was used as <br/>
well. Why not look at Anthony Bryant's site on the subject? It will <br/>
serve as a great intro to the subject, actually more than intro! and you <br/>
can find out how it's really made.<br/>
