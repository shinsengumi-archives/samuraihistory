You should check out the book "Legends of the Samurai" by Hiroaki Sato. <br/>
It's a great read, but most of the happenings in it are more realistic <br/>
than fantasy. Definately a good start. Also, head out to Barnes and <br/>
Noble (or Amazon) and check the mythology section for books like <br/>
"Japanese Fairy Tales" by Keiske Nishimoto and other such books. A <br/>
little study of Shinto will reveal some interesting Japanese tales as well.<br/>

ps - be sure to check out the "kappa" turtle-demon!!!!<br/>

Noble bookstore to those books and maybe just maybe<br/>
find the other "Musashi" books, I already have the<br/>
first book, thank you for the help, I appreciate that.<br/>
