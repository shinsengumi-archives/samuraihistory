<h3>Turbull&#39;s Papers</h3>

<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-398698839">This might have been 'lost' in my last post, so I'll put it out - can <br/>
someone please tell me exactly what Turnbull has his doctorate in and <br/>
exactly where he got it, as well as if it is one of those 'honorary' <br/>
doctorates, or a 'real' one?<br/>
<br/>
If he has a doctorate in horticulture or screenwriting then I'll not <br/>
only forgive the guy, but give him kudos for putting out the effort <br/>
(however limited) in putting out Japanese history books to the <br/>
pubic!  If on the other hand, he has a doctorate in Japanese history, <br/>
my criticism stands.<br/>

Hmm, maybe I should check more closely.<br/>
