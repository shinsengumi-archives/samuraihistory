Subject: [samuraihistory] Samurai status - fixed or floating?<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
If the title of this post is not copyright by the way, I claim<br/>
intellectual rights to it now!<br/>
<br/>
I wanted to join the discussion about class promotion/demotion without<br/>
necessarily siding with Nina or Nate in the debate, although I think I<br/>
come dowen on Nate's side of the fence, but I wanted to put another<br/>
aspect, especially with reference to the Sengoku.<br/>
<br/>
Two sayings sum up the ethos of the era:<br/>
gekokuji - "the low overthrow the high,"<br/>
jakuniku kyshoku-"the weak become meat; the strong eat."<br/>
<br/>
In the wake of the Onin Wars, everything was up for grabs.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
But the instability of gekokuj could not have continued indefinitely.<br/>
Daimyo<br/>
<br/>
A samurai's strength depended essentially upon:<br/>
1 - his ability to sustain himself;<br/>
2 - his ability to defend himself.<br/>
<br/>
Thus a samurai was traditionally dependent upon the land, but a<br/>
samurai with land is independent, and the emergence of each shogunate<br/>
saw an attempt to sever this tie and create a vertical dependency upon<br/>
a hierarchic structure, so that a samurai's principle 'strength' lay<br/>
in and was dependent on the 'grace and favour' of his superiors.<br/>
<br/>
Sword hunts, land reforms, etc., were all attempts to control and<br/>
limit local autonomy. Hideyoshi's edicts, for example, were an attempt<br/>
to prevent the occurance of another Hideyoshi.<br/>
<br/>
Some samurai formed alliances with farmers and merchants, offering<br/>
mutual protection and support. Thus farmers provided for the samurai<br/>
who in turn protected them, and issues were discussed 'in the round.'<br/>
As the larger daimyates engulfed the smaller, this proto-democratic<br/>
process was stamped out vigorously. The Big Names were having none of<br/>
that! Democracy? Pah!<br/>
<br/>
On the flip side, the Mikawa bushi (for example) were so reduced that<br/>
they were obliged to work alongisde their farmers if they were going<br/>
to eat. Time and again we can read of samurai living on or over the<br/>
edge of poverty, so that any distinction between 'peasant' and<br/>
'samurai' was largely theoretical. In reality, everyone was starving.<br/>
<br/>
Within all this <br/>

<br/>
<br/>
In the wake of the chaos of the Onin wars, point 1 was rendered void<br/>
as a number of the great samurai houses, domiciled in Kyoto but<br/>
dependent upon income from distant estates, were so reduced as to<br/>
become powerless. Local estate managers either usurped the rights of<br/>
the absentee owners, weakened in the Onin Wars, or simply by filling<br/>
the void left by their demise. The Oda were one, and probably the<br/>
Matsudaira (later Tokugawa) were another.<br/>
