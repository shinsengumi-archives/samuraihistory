The Takeda were a Shugo family under the Ashikaga<br/>
Shogunate. At one time, they held appointments in Aki,<br/>
but it was well before the Mori came to prominence.<br/>
When Mori Motonari defeated Sue Harukata at Miyajima<br/>
in 1551 to take control of the former Ouchi lands, the<br/>
Takeda clan was concentrated in Kai under Shingen, and<br/>
was busy fighting the Uesugi, Hojo, Imagawa, et al.<br/>
The Takeda were long gone from Aki by this point. <br/>
<br/>
It gets confusing, because there were about 8 or 9<br/>
families that held multiple Shugo appointments under<br/>
the Ashikaga, often with no semblance of geographic<br/>
relations (by design, perhaps). The Shiba held<br/>
appointments in Owari, Totomi, Echizen, and a couple<br/>
other provinces on and off. The Takeda were at various<br/>
times Shugo of Aki, Wakasa, Kai (their traditional<br/>
home, I believe), and possibly somewhere in Kyushu for<br/>
a brief period. The Imagawa had Suruga, lands in<br/>
northern Kyushu, etc. In the transition from Ashikaga<br/>
Shugo to Sengoku daimyo, if the shugo family survived,<br/>
usually in centralized in one location and lost it's<br/>
land elsewhere. Takeda centralized in Kai, Imagawa in<br/>
Suruga, etc. The Shiba died. Other shugo daimyo like<br/>
the Shimazu held contiguous holdings (Satsuma, Osumi,<br/>
part of Hyuga) so it was fairly easy to hold onto<br/>
their territory and make the transition. Of course,<br/>
they became Ashikaga Shugo for the same reason<br/>
Hideyoshi and Ieyasu later confirmed them in their<br/>
holdings--it would have been harder to uproot them<br/>
than to just let them stay, since the Shimazu had<br/>
ruled the area since, oh, about the time of Jimmu<br/>
Tenno, it seems. <br/>

<h3>Re: Takeda lands question</h3>
by <i>kitsuno</i>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1215975277">Actually, there was a Takeda clan of a different branch than the Kai <br/>
Takeda there into the 16th century.  Mori Motonari won an impressive <br/>
victory over them, one of his earliest victories.  They seem to have <br/>
fallen off the map after that:<br/>
<br/>
"Motonari was born Shojumaru, the second son of Môri Hiromoto, a <br/>
daimyo who struggled against the local Takeda clan (not to be <br/>
confused with the Kai branch of that family) and the encroaching <br/>
Oûchi. In 1499, Hiromoto found himself in the path of a looming <br/>
Amako invasion from Izumo, and allied with Oûchi. At the time, Oûchi <br/>
Yoshioki was becoming involved in the gunboat politics of Kyoto and <br/>
while he was away, the Amako grew stronger. In 1506 Hiromoto died, <br/>
and was succeded by his eldest son, Okimoto, who ended up assisting <br/>
Yoshioki in Kyoto for a short period. It happened that he died in <br/>
1516, and Motonari was named to act as guardian to the late lord's <br/>
young son, Komatsumaru. Komatsumaru in turn was to die in 1523, after <br/>
which Motonari became the official head of he clan. Evidently, <br/>
Môri's predecessors had died under unclear circumstances, for there <br/>
is a legend that it was Motonari himself who dispatched them. At any <br/>
rate, Motonari did not inherit a particularly enviable position. The <br/>
most powerful daimyo in Aki, Takeda Motoshige, took advantage of <br/>
Okimoto's death to make a play for Môri land, and in Izumo the Amako <br/>
began to rattle their sabers. Luckily for the Môri, however, their <br/>
young lord quickly proved himself a man of action. Takeda had set out <br/>
to take Koriyama Castle (the Môri's chief bastion since the early <br/>
14th Century) but found his troops intercepted and routed by the <br/>
numerically inferior Môri clan. This victory carried a certain <br/>
prestige value for Motonari, but was quickly over-shadowed by greater <br/>
events."<br/>

dedicated to single Samurai.  The library near me has のすべて<br/>
books <br/>
on Shingen, Kenshin, Ieyasu, Motonari, Otomo Sorin, Ishida Mitsunari, <br/>
Oda Nobunaga, and Hosokawa Fujitaka.  I am sure they must have Akechi <br/>
Mitsuhide out there, and they are all over 200 pages, they seem to be <br/>
pretty solid bios.</div>

 </span></blockquote>Check out the "(so-and-so) no subete" books - They are books <br/>
dedicated to single Samurai.  The library near me has &#65533;&#65533;&#65533;&#65533;&#65533;&#65533;&#65533;&#65533;<br/>
books <br/>
on Shingen, Kenshin, Ieyasu, Motonari, Otomo Sorin, Ishida Mitsunari, <br/>
Oda Nobunaga, and Hosokawa Fujitaka.  I am sure they must have Akechi <br/>
Mitsuhide out there, and they are all over 200 pages, they seem to be <br/>
pretty solid bios.<br/>

Actually, there was a Takeda clan of a different branch than the Kai <br/>
Takeda there into the 16th century.  Mori Motonari won an impressive <br/>
victory over them, one of his earliest victories.  They seem to have <br/>
fallen off the map after that:<br/>
<br/>
"Motonari was born Shojumaru, the second son of M�ri Hiromoto, a <br/>
daimyo who struggled against the local Takeda clan (not to be <br/>
confused with the Kai branch of that family) and the encroaching <br/>
O�chi. In 1499, Hiromoto found himself in the path of a looming <br/>
Amako invasion from Izumo, and allied with O�chi. At the time, O�chi <br/>
Yoshioki was becoming involved in the gunboat politics of Kyoto and <br/>
while he was away, the Amako grew stronger. In 1506 Hiromoto died, <br/>
and was succeded by his eldest son, Okimoto, who ended up assisting <br/>
Yoshioki in Kyoto for a short period. It happened that he died in <br/>
1516, and Motonari was named to act as guardian to the late lord's <br/>
young son, Komatsumaru. Komatsumaru in turn was to die in 1523, after <br/>
which Motonari became the official head of he clan. Evidently, <br/>
M�ri's predecessors had died under unclear circumstances, for there <br/>
is a legend that it was Motonari himself who dispatched them. At any <br/>
rate, Motonari did not inherit a particularly enviable position. The <br/>
most powerful daimyo in Aki, Takeda Motoshige, took advantage of <br/>
Okimoto's death to make a play for M�ri land, and in Izumo the Amako <br/>
began to rattle their sabers. Luckily for the M�ri, however, their <br/>
young lord quickly proved himself a man of action. Takeda had set out <br/>
to take Koriyama Castle (the M�ri's chief bastion since the early <br/>
14th Century) but found his troops intercepted and routed by the <br/>
numerically inferior M�ri clan. This victory carried a certain <br/>
prestige value for Motonari, but was quickly over-shadowed by greater <br/>
events."<br/>
