<h3>Tales of the Samurai Podcast Series #1 - Seppuku: Samurai Suicide</h3>
by <i>kitsuno</i>
<br/><br/>
Hey everyone, <br/> <br/><br/> I just wanted to let everyone who is part of this group know that the Samurai Archives Podcast is still going strong after 6 years, and I've started a new sub-series called "Tales of the Samurai", where I'll go in depth into a single topic each episode, which will probably fall every three months between regular Samurai Archives Podcast episodes.  The first episode in the series is a complete history and examination of Seppuku.  You can find that, and all other episodes here as well as on iTunes:<br/> <br/><br/> http://samuraipodcast.com/seppuku-samurai-suicide-tales-of-the-samurai-1 http://samuraipodcast.com/seppuku-samurai-suicide-tales-of-the-samurai-1<br/><br/> <br/><br/> And if you haven't done so already, be sure to sign up at the new Samurai Archives Forum, where most of the action takes place now that this yahoo group has fallen by the wayside:<br/> <br/><br/> http://forums.samurai-archives.com/index/ http://forums.samurai-archives.com/index/<br/><br/> <br/><br/> Enjoy!<br/> <br/><br/><p><span>Hey everyone, </span></p><p><span><br></span></p><p>I just wanted to let everyone who is part of this group know that the Samurai Archives Podcast is still going strong after 6 years, and I've started a new sub-series called "Tales of the Samurai", where I'll go in depth into a single topic each episode, which will probably fall every three months between regular Samurai Archives Podcast episodes.  The first episode in the series is a complete history and examination of Seppuku.  You can find that, and all other episodes here as well as on iTunes:</p><p><br></p><p><a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://samuraipodcast.com/seppuku-samurai-suicide-tales-of-the-samurai-1">http://samuraipodcast.com/seppuku-samurai-suicide-tales-of-the-samurai-1</a><br></p><p><br></p><p>And if you haven't done so already, be sure to sign up at the new Samurai Archives Forum, where most of the action takes place now that this yahoo group has fallen by the wayside:</p><p><br></p><p><a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://forums.samurai-archives.com/index/">http://forums.samurai-archives.com/index/</a><br></p><p><br></p><p>Enjoy!</p><p><br></p>
