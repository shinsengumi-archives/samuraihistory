KOLDING, DENMARK.-Museet på Koldinghus presents Japan  Culture and <br/>
Art in the Edo Period (1603-1867) - A flourishing time under the <br/>
Shogun. The most ambitious exhibition so far held in Koldinghus <br/>
Museum, presented under the patronage of His Royal Highness Crown <br/>
Prince Frederik of Denmark, has been prepared in conjunction with <br/>
the National Museum of Denmark and displays a large number of <br/>
Japanese artefacts such as Samurai equipment, kimonos, paintings, <br/>
woodcuts and refined craftwork. The exhibits are lent by museums in <br/>
Denmark and abroad, and some of them come from the historical museum <br/>
in the Japanese town of Anjo, which is Kolding's twin town. <br/>
<br/>
Japan has an unusual and fascinating history, and the Edo period is <br/>
considered to be an era of cultural blossoming in which the art and <br/>
culture of the elite spread to large sections of society. The <br/>
exhibition provides a rare insight into many of the old traditions <br/>
that have continued to play a major role in modern Japanese society. <br/>
Stories about the Samurai concept of honour and images of the <br/>
beautiful courtesans of the Edo period are enduring picturesque <br/>
components of our knowledge about Japan. The exhibition will be <br/>
shown from 20 August 2005 until 8 January 2006. <br/>
