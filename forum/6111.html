My neck would get a crick in it from trying to spot the shinobi come to whup my ...... delicate self.<br/>
<br/>
On the other hand,  List High Master Kitsuno would still be Minister of Security,  Deputy LHM  (twice removed) would still be <br/>
Minister of Literacy (sub-duties include intelligence testing, decorum, grammar, and spelling), and the Grand PoohBah Bryant would <br/>
still be the Minister of Accuracy (sub-duties include lightning-quick, knife-pointed sarcasm, in which he excels.  Bryant-dono ---  <br/>
was that your Laurel?).<br/>
<br/>
So, since all things remain the same, who needs a 'president'?<br/>
<br/>
Silly me,<br/>

WOW Miss Chase for new President of samuraihistory forum. GOD BLESS all and<br/>
go vote<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Poor lad.  Who gave you the sublime misapprehension that this was a<br/>
democracy?<br/>
<br/>
..And it's a damned good thing too:  because with no offense to the lady<br/>
in question, and as pleasant as I (for one) find her posts, scholarship does<br/>
not flourish in such a democracy.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Thanks. But it's no democracy. This is thoroughly a<br/>
dictatorship, and you can consider me your friendly<br/>
neighborhood stormtrooper. <br/>
<br/>
Thanks!<br/>
