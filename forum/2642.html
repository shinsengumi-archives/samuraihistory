<br/>
December 5, 2003<br/>
By ELVIS MITCHELL <br/>
<br/>
There is probably no director more obsessed with the<br/>
complexity of patriotism - an unusual subject to plumb in<br/>
mainstream films - than Edward Zwick, who is driven to<br/>
question the imperatives of an America that his<br/>
protagonists both love and detest. His latest movie, "The<br/>
Last Samurai," falls squarely into the realm of the<br/>
previous Zwick bedeviled-hero films, "Glory," "Courage<br/>
Under Fire" and "The Siege." <br/>
<br/>
And I do mean squarely. "Samurai" is a mythic western that<br/>
combines a fish-out-of-water theme with an immersion in<br/>
Japanese culture: John Ford's "Lost in Translation." It<br/>
depicts phalanxes of troops moving with deliberate,<br/>
terrifying fervor across the very wide screen. <br/>
<br/>
And this time Tom Cruise, the can-do idol of millions, uses<br/>
his polished-chrome smile mirthlessly. At least for the<br/>
first hour, his grin looks like a faded tattoo. The uneven<br/>
"Samurai" is a can-do movie that's far more effective at<br/>
communicating emotion in bigger scenes than in more<br/>
intimate ones. <br/>
<br/>
Mr. Cruise plays Nathan Algren, a burned-out former Army<br/>
officer and Indian fighter. Having survived Custer's Last<br/>
Stand in 1876, he is now a commercial sideshow prop,<br/>
demonstrating the newest Winchester rifle. As Algren<br/>
lumbers through the clich�s he's hired to recite before<br/>
blasting away at targets - though the whiskey oozing from<br/>
his pores probably makes him more of a danger than the<br/>
weapon - a sudden ember of regret flames in this<br/>
ex-soldier's eyes. He goes off the script, reciting the<br/>
horrors of a campaign in which he and his troops<br/>
slaughtered innocents. <br/>
<br/>
Algren looks so wasted and beleaguered that the biggest<br/>
question is not whether he'll wing an audience member with<br/>
a stray shot, but whether he can bear up under the dense,<br/>
cast-iron plot. After being bounced by the Winchester<br/>
folks, Algren is hired by his former commander, Colonel<br/>
Bagley (Tony Goldwyn, playing a salamanderlike ancestor of<br/>
all the sleazy characters he's ever portrayed). Bagley<br/>
wants Algren to travel with him to Tokyo and train Japanese<br/>
soldiers in the use of American tactics and rifles. The<br/>
Meiji emperor is ready to accept the ways of the West; he's<br/>
actually being pressured to by American business interests.<br/>
<br/>
Once in Japan, Algren is forced to send his nervous,<br/>
underprepared imperial troops into battle too soon against<br/>
an enemy of the emperor, the samurai Katsumoto (Ken<br/>
Watanabe). Despite the imperial army's modern weapons,<br/>
Katsumoto and his men sweep in with ferocity and wield<br/>
their arms of the past - swords and spears - with lethal<br/>
effectiveness. The cinematographer, John Toll, films their<br/>
arrival through a thick fog in a forest, as if Katsumoto's<br/>
men were ghosts from the recent past out to rob Algren's<br/>
troops of their backbones - and their lives. <br/>
<br/>
In their ritual armor, Katsumoto's men make quick work of<br/>
their foes; there's tragicomic relief as Algren's<br/>
conscripted farmers tremble while trying to load their<br/>
guns. When a wounded Algren kills Katsumoto's second in<br/>
command, he's captured by the invaders and, even more<br/>
bewildering, cared for by Katsumoto's sister, Taka<br/>
(Koyuki), the widow of the man Algren murdered. <br/>
<br/>
It's a complicated story, and Mr. Zwick is complicated,<br/>
too: he loves arrogance slapped out of its self-regard.<br/>
Algren is full of himself, even though he's conceived as a<br/>
man who was second tenor to a legend; he knew and despised<br/>
Custer. Looking fashionably distressed, with slightly<br/>
puffy, red-rimmed eyes that at the very least suggest that<br/>
he's survived a grueling press junket, Mr. Cruise has a<br/>
worn cockiness. His aw-shucks virility is a little wilted,<br/>
if not mildewed, around the edges: a kind of reverse<br/>
narcissism, since Algren is proud of his dissolution<br/>
(though Mr. Cruise's good-boy posture works for a man<br/>
reared under the disciplinary rigors of the military). <br/>
<br/>
Although at times Mr. Cruise comes off as too contemporary<br/>
for the 19th century - at one point, he seems to be waiting<br/>
for a cellphone call to confirm his terms for a cover of<br/>
Details magazine - this displacement fits better when he<br/>
becomes a prisoner. Algren appears to be reacting to this<br/>
strange new world through sounds; nothing he's hearing<br/>
makes any sense to him. He's a mangy gaijin that Edgar Rice<br/>
Burroughs might have invented, though James Clavell got<br/>
there eventually. <br/>
<br/>
The film includes notable performances by actors not<br/>
drafted to shoulder the burden of the entire production.<br/>
Billy Connolly, emanating a gamy, sly menace that he's<br/>
rarely suggested before, plays Algren's former sergeant at<br/>
arms, Zebulon Gant. Gant, used to propping up his old<br/>
friend and superior officer, joins Algren in the journey to<br/>
Japan. Mr. Connolly's loose, hostile vivacity registers so<br/>
clearly that it's obvious we won't be seeing very much of<br/>
him. But this is crackling, rigorous comic work; he doesn't<br/>
have to present the face of tragedy. <br/>
<br/>
The far more weighted and daring acting comes from Mr.<br/>
Watanabe, as Katsumoto. Probably best known outside of<br/>
Japan as the reedy, restless sidekick in the gourmand<br/>
classic "Tampopo," Mr. Watanabe has filled out physically<br/>
and spiritually. The formality he brings to Katsumoto is<br/>
hard-won, especially when he's having pointedly thoughtful<br/>
conversations with Algren that sound more like translations<br/>
of ideograms than actual dialogue. <br/>
<br/>
The film never really explains how or why this resolute,<br/>
isolated samurai learned to speak English better than the<br/>
emperor. His fluency doesn't quite make sense, though it<br/>
gives the movie some needed mystique. It plays better than<br/>
the inexorable pull of romance, drawing Taka and Algren<br/>
together. <br/>
<br/>
"The Last Samurai," which Mr. Zwick and Marshall Herskovitz<br/>
wrote with John Logan, from a story by Mr. Logan,<br/>
super-glues together a host of contradictions.<br/>
Unfortunately, as dramatized, they function as conventions<br/>
that are older than the story the film is weaving. The<br/>
movie, which opens nationwide today, is most watchable<br/>
during the majestic brutality of the battle sequences. This<br/>
is not only because of the handsome staging, but also<br/>
because the keywords sacrifice and honor are evoked with<br/>
verve and simplicity, more so than in the "exchange of<br/>
idea" chats between Algren and Katsumoto, which sound like<br/>
statements being read into the Congressional Record by<br/>
Nathaniel Hawthorne. <br/>
<br/>
Mr. Zwick has absorbed the lethal agility of Akira<br/>
Kurosawa; what registers just as powerfully as the sureness<br/>
of the combatants is the ugly futility of the battles<br/>
themselves. When the film sets up the lessons that Algren<br/>
has to learn, the hero is not really a fish out of water;<br/>
he's more like a big fish in a dry pond, picking up a<br/>
lesson in Eastern deportment and philosophy a step away<br/>
from the "wax-on, wax-off" curriculum of "The Karate Kid."<br/>
In those scenes presaging his Eastern conversion, Algren<br/>
can't suppress his eagerness to learn, picking up the ways<br/>
of the sword and the Samurai code of Bushido with an<br/>
alacrity that's mandated for movie stars: flash-card<br/>
education. <br/>
<br/>
The film's title evokes James Fenimore Cooper, though he<br/>
had enough perspective not to make a white man "the last"<br/>
in his novel. Even though "The Last Samurai" opts for<br/>
Japan's cultural differences, all of the unmentioned<br/>
hardships of a feudal society notwithstanding, the<br/>
remaining honorable native here is an American. Is that a<br/>
veiled way of saying that Japan's old ways were doomed<br/>
after all? <br/>
<br/>
"The Last Samurai" is rated R (Under 17 requires<br/>
accompanying parent or adult guardian). It has violence,<br/>
including enough ritualistic bloodletting for a week on the<br/>
History Channel; alcohol use; strong language; and a chaste<br/>
hint of sexuality. <br/>

The Tale of the Heike<br/>
<br/>
The most important of the Kamakura (1185�1333) and Muromachi <br/>
(1333�1568) period prose tales known as gunki monogatari, or �war <br/>
tales.� It deals with the short heyday of the Taira family (the 20 <br/>
years following the Hogen Disturbance [1156] and the Heiji Disturbance <br/>
[1160], when they not only defeated their rivals, the Minamoto family, <br/>
but also ousted the Fujiwara family from its dominant position at <br/>
court) and the five years of the Taira-Minamoto War. The war began with <br/>
the Minamoto rising again in 1180 and ended with the crushing defeat of <br/>
the Taira in 1185. The tale divides into roughly three parts. The <br/>
central figure in the first is Taira no Kiyomori. Arrogant, evil, and <br/>
ruthless, he is above all so consumed by the fires of hatred for the <br/>
Minamoto that he dies in agony, his feverish body beyond all cooling, <br/>
even when he is immersed in water. The main figures of the second and <br/>
third parts are generals on the Minamoto side, first Minamoto no <br/>
Yoshinaka and then, after his death, the heroic Minamoto no Yoshitsune, <br/>
a youthful military genius wrongly suspected of treachery by his elder <br/>
brother Minamoto no Yoritomo.<br/>
<br/>
Heike monogatari abounds in stirring scenes of battle, recounting brave <br/>
deeds by warriors proud of their lineage and military prowess and <br/>
prizing loyalty above life. Dealing with the cataclysmic upheavals of <br/>
this time of Taira and Minamoto rivalry, it undoubtedly has a grand <br/>
sweep about it that can be described as �epic.� Whether it may truly be <br/>
termed an epic is debatable, principally because of its lyrical and <br/>
emotional content. Several episodes about tragic lovers or love affairs <br/>
have an atmosphere redolent of the mono no aware of Heian court <br/>
literature. Also, the emphasis throughout is very much on the pathos of <br/>
the situation of the Taira, a warrior family that rose to importance at <br/>
court, only to be forced out by uncouth rivals from eastern Japan. The <br/>
atmosphere of the whole work is permeated by the Buddhist doctrine that <br/>
all human activity is ephemeral and illusory, that the mighty are soon <br/>
cast down, and that nothing avails but faith in the grace of the Buddha <br/>
Amida.<br/>
<br/>
Such Buddhist sentiments are not uncommon in the literature of the <br/>
time, but the reason for their prominence in Heike monogatari is that <br/>
those responsible for the development of this work were chanters (biwa <br/>
hoshi), lute-playing priests who traveled the country reciting this and <br/>
other chronicles. They were blind men who used no fixed text but rather <br/>
recreated the work at each performance on the basis of oral formulae. <br/>
The original Heike text, dating from the early 13th century, comprises <br/>
material from various sources, including oral tales about the wars, <br/>
some of which may have been first told as religious rituals for the <br/>
benefit of the dead warriors. From the mid-13th century, two traditions <br/>
developed. One was a line of texts for silent reading, culminating <br/>
inGempei seisuiki, and the other was a line of texts for oral chanters, <br/>
which contained many passages in the 7-5 syllable rhythm of classical <br/>
poetry. The chanted tradition continued well into the Muromachi period, <br/>
but of all the approximately 100 texts of theHeike, the accepted <br/>
standard is the version dictated by a master Heike performer, Akashi <br/>
Kakuichi, just before his death in 1371. Heike texts vary not only in <br/>
wording but also in content, revealing the development of social <br/>
attitudes and ideals of conduct.<br/>
<br/>
Heike monogatari contains so much of varied human interest that it has <br/>
been almost as popular a source for later Japanese writers as has Genji <br/>
monogatari (Tale of Genji). It has provided material for a number of No <br/>
plays. Some of these, such as Atsumori, are �warrior pieces,� but <br/>
several are based on more lyrical episodes about tragic lovers, <br/>
particularly women, such as Gio, Senju, and Kogo.<br/>
