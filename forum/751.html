<h3>Nobunaga&#39;s motives</h3>
by <i>kitsuno</i>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1606269076">It's always a given that Nobunaga started the unification process <br/>
ultimately concluded by Hideyoshi and Ieyasu.  But what were <br/>
Nobunaga's motives?  He died too soon to ever really know, and most <br/>
historians don't even attempt to glean the 'why'.  I've created a poll <br/>
with 12 possible reasons, that you can find here:<br/>

<br/>
Go vote in the poll, and post your opinions!  I myself think that he <br/>
probably didn't intend to at first, but as he gathered power, it sort <br/>
of came as a natural result - fell into place.  Some people, like <br/>
Napoleon, Hitler, and others (Robert Jordan would call them "Ta'veren" <br/>
- to throw in an obscure reference) somehow not only end up on paths <br/>
to greatness (or great evil), but are spectacularly suited for the <br/>
job, and rather than being pulled along with the flow of events, they <br/>
create the flow.  I think Nobunaga falls into this category.<br/>
<br/>
What are some other views?<br/>
