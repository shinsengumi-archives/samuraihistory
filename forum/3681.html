<h3>Paper on Japanese history... anybody?</h3>
by <i>cepooooo</i>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1728879769">I was wondering... I am writing yet another paper on the Meiji <br/>
Restoration for my grad class. These papers (4-6 pages) are usually to <br/>
be written in 4 days, and are real killers, since there is technically <br/>
no time to double and triple check one's sources. (we usually read <br/>
3-400 pages per paper) I usually exchange them with some of my <br/>
classmates the day before they're due, but rarely get a real input.<br/>
<br/>
Well, since in this mailing list there are so many competent people, I <br/>
was thinking that maybe somebody ***MIGHT*** want to read the final <br/>
draft of my papers, and point out to eventual mistakes. More over, I <br/>
suppose I am not the only student here, so it would be cool if others <br/>
as well would exchange papers and we could help each other, while <br/>
learning something new.<br/>
<br/>
Well, my paper is due on Tuesday... let me know here or in private if <br/>
you have the time and the will to check it... Or should I simply send <br/>
it like a post, and the willing can criticize it. That would be... <br/>
ouch... but... why not??<br/>
Thanks and ban-banzai.<br/>
cepo<br/>
<br/>
PS = Professor Tony and other faculty on the list... This would be <br/>
academically acceptable, right? I mean, I am not asking people to write <br/>
my papers, just to give an opinion on them...</div>

 </span></blockquote>There's no reason you can't have people look at it and give you opinions. We're <br/>
not going to *rewrite* it. <G><br/>
<br/>
You can send it to me and I'll try to look it over.<br/>
