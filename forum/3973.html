<div id="ygrps-yiv-337672104">Hi there guys. I've been away. I had simultaneously huge problems with <br/>
both of my families: in Japan (a divorce - not mine!!!) and in Europe <br/>
(my mom was sick, and my sister was on a train in Madrid the day of the <br/>
bombs - no BS!! She's ok, luckily). I used my spring-break to fix all <br/>
the mess, but sadly I wasn't able to go to Kyoto and to participate to <br/>
the discussions on this mailing list. Now I have 395 messages to <br/>
read... hihihi.<br/>
I missed you guys.<br/>
ciao<br/>
Cepo, from Honolulu<br/>
PS=I'll be in japan in the summer, so the gathering is still up, uh?</div>
