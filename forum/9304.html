<div id="ygrps-yiv-801175304">Hi!<br/>
<br/>
My name is Leon, i'm from Mexico. I've been lurking<br/>
around this group for about two or three years without<br/>
posting even once.<br/>
<br/>
It's not like i didn't wanted to ask anything, if you<br/>
are a newbie, the information out there in<br/>
Samuraihistory.com should be enough for starters.<br/>
<br/>
I have to thank you guys for changing my first<br/>
impression from samurai (hollywood point of view) to a<br/>
more accurate (i suppose) general overview.<br/>
<br/>
Anyway, i've enjoyed the discussions between members<br/>
with lots of knowledge, like Tony, Kitsuno, and many<br/>
others, along with their websites.<br/>
<br/>
So this is what i wanted to ask: I've been buying<br/>
lately two manga from dark horse, Lone wolf & cub and<br/>
Samurai executioner. Aside from these fictional<br/>
characters (well, i read somewhere that Yamada sama<br/>
did actually exist), is the information about the<br/>
organization of the social classes and structure of<br/>
society somewhat accurate?<br/>
<br/>
Did Tenma-cho, and all that bureacracy that appears in<br/>
Samurai executioner was like that back then?<br/>
<br/>
Simply put: are these sources reliable in historical<br/>
terms?<br/>
<br/>
Thank you in advance for your comments.<br/>
<br/>
León<br/>
