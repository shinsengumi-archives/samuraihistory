<h3>Re: band of brothers</h3>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-456513213">if you haven't seen band of brothers... spend the 10 bucks or whatever it costs to rent it... I GUARANTEE you will be awed by it. It's the best ww2 movie ever made... there's no close second. It's based on actual events, too. The interviews with the actual guys who were there are pretty good, too. But remember it's a ten part miniseries, with hour long episodes.  So rent it and watch a couple of the episodes a night, and you'll knock it out pretty quick. Sounds really good on surround sound, too. But there aren't any japanese in it if I remember right... it happens on the European front...<br/>

<h3>message for the SAMURAI HISTORY moderator</h3>
by <i>umaryu</i>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-378175278">to them Moderator<br/>
<br/>
is there any chance that you can start removing all<br/>
emails regarding world war two before they get sent<br/>
out to us.<br/>
<br/>
maybe send them on to a forum that discusses world war<br/>
2 or just delete them.<br/>
<br/>
I signed up to here to learn about samurai and<br/>
japanese history<br/>
<br/>
I am not here to read about what the band of brothers<br/>
did or what happened at pearl harbour.<br/>
<br/>
yes  I agree its great history and they are great<br/>
films but this is not the forum for such discussions.<br/>
