One possibilitie is that "tane" means "seed". But give me more info <br/>
such as the person who named your name,your gender...<br/>

"Tiger" is "tora" in Japanese.<br/>
Is "spirit of the tiger" also person's name?It seems to be rare too.<br/>

Go easy on him, Tony ;)<br/>
<br/>
anyway, I'm sure he didn't mean offense - - My wife, who is Japanese <br/>
(from Japan, not JA) has never heard the name either, so I think it is <br/>
an honest mistake - it must be a rare name, or one that has fallen <br/>
out of use - or even a local variation on another, more 'typical' <br/>
name.  As for 'Torakami' - it isn't a word, and if the two characters <br/>
were seen together they would be read something like 'kojin' - <br/>
although I doubt that's a word.  Like another poster on here stated, <br/>
'tora no tamashii' would litteraly mean 'spirit of the tiger'.  <br/>
Toranokami would be pretty cool, but I don't know how well it would <br/>
fit in 'reality' since all of the ~no kamis were always preceeded by <br/>
the name of a province.</div>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Did I say it was stupid? I said it's not a name.<br/>
<br/>
"Kami" means "god" or "deity" specifically, not "the spirit of something."<br/>
So first of all, it's impossible for "Torakami" to means "spirit of the<br/>
tiger." If anything, it would be "tiger god."<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Then perhaps you will recall that my exact words were "Without the kanji, it<br/>
would be impossible. Frankly "Taneiko" doesn't sound typically Japanese to<br/>
me. Taneko would, but Taneiko... something seems odd."<br/>
<br/>
Well, here goes.<br/>
<br/>
Women's names using "-ko" endings are typically one kanji (haru, yuki, hana)<br/>
plus the finishing "-ko." There is *no* kanji that has "tamei" as a reading.<br/>
To get to "tanei" you need two kanji (or more) to produce tane+i, or ta+nei,<br/>
or ta+ne+i (the last one, meaning a four kanji name, is statistically<br/>
improbable. Therefore we're stuck with "tane+i" or "ta+nei." Since there few<br/>
kanji with the reading "nei", but not often seen in names, we're<br/>
functionally limited, then to "tane+i", which produces the question, which<br/>
kanji combination would allow a (positive meaning) name combining the<br/>
syllables tane+i+ko?<br/>
<br/>
There are a few names that are listed in my books with the reading "Taneko"<br/>
(no "i") -- one "tane" meaning "seed/kernel" and the other meaning<br/>
"egg/seed" or "sincerity." There is a third "tane" which pops up in names --<br/>
"issue/offspring" -- but it's very unusual these days.<br/>
<br/>
So what we have is a very improbably Tane*i*ko, but a very probable Tane[no<br/>
*i*]ko.<br/>
<br/>
Now, it's possible that whoever Romanized the name added the "i" to make<br/>
sure people would pronounce it properly (like the errant "y" that sometimes<br/>
pops up in Ma[y]eda and U[y]eda. These variant readings are common, however.<br/>
Taneiko is not. Therefore, again, we're back to "either the name is Taneko<br/>
and someone mis-Romanized it" or "it's not a typical Japanese name."<br/>
<br/>
Do you find a flaw with the argument or with the [original] conclusion?<br/>
<br/>
For the record, Japanese onomastics, especially historical onomastics, is a<br/>
field I study, and I study it seriously.<br/>
<br/>
Before you get all huffy, perhaps you should consider that some people *do*<br/>
know more than you do.<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>That's what I think. I think someone stuck an extra vowel in there. But<br/>
honestly, whether it should be "taneko" or even "taniko" I couldn't say. And<br/>
given the great number of homophones in Japanese, the typical response must<br/>
be, "without the kanji the question 'what does it mean' is itself<br/>
meaningless."<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Frankly, that was my first inclination, as well. But then again, I've been<br/>
doing too much lately with archaic Chinese stuff, so the Sino-Japanese<br/>
reading came to mind first. I'd like to be able to say "Tora no kami" hit me<br/>
first, but I have to get my head back into some Muromachi texts for a while<br/>
to reformat my mind-set. <G><br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> > Like another poster on here stated,<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Indeed it would; but it wouldn't be a name, either. The thing is, names<br/>
don't really literally translate well. Heck, I used to live in Stone Well<br/>
Mouth Public Field, commuting to work via Western Samurai Pond Bag and then<br/>
to Circle Center. Later I moved to There Are Turtles, and after that lived<br/>
in Big Eternal Preservation. (That is, Shakujii Koen, Seibu Ikebukuro,<br/>
Marunouchi, Kameari, and Ogikubo <G>.)<br/>

    I am assuming you are a woman. I am no expert either but I have to say that<br/>
Mr. Bryant has looked at the name in all the ways any student of the language<br/>
would to try and make a determination. It is all too often true that without<br/>
the kanji it is impossible to make one.<br/>
    If you haven't access to the kanji perhaps you know your Great Grand<br/>
Mothers family name? Could yours be Tanei Kou? In your Great grandmothers time<br/>
girls names without the appellation -ko  were the norm for lower to middle<br/>
class families. In the Taisho/Showa period Tane-ko, Kinu-ko, Yuu-ko and the<br/>
like became popular. Could you be Okou san and your family name is Tanei? More<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-649680692">Hello Taneiko, I think Tony can be enough called an authority on <br/>
Japanese culture.Even native Japanese including myself, few have as <br/>
much knoledge and insight as he has.And he has never called someone <br/>
stupid.The information he gave is the most valuable for you.As i <br/>
wrote in my last massage, it is fair for you to provide as much <br/>
information as possible.Especially kanji and gender are important.<br/>
<br/>
Actually I also think you are "Taneko" if you are a woman.And Tony <br/>
had already written more than I intended to say in the previous <br/>
massages.<br/>
<br/>
Of course I never mean to offend you.We here all are friends with <br/>

<br/>
Go easy on him, Tony ;)<br/>
<br/>
anyway, I'm sure he didn't mean offense - - My wife, who is Japanese <br/>
(from Japan, not JA) has never heard the name either, so I think it is <br/>
an honest mistake - it must be a rare name, or one that has fallen <br/>
out of use - or even a local variation on another, more 'typical' <br/>
name.  As for 'Torakami' - it isn't a word, and if the two characters <br/>
were seen together they would be read something like 'kojin' - <br/>
although I doubt that's a word.  Like another poster on here stated, <br/>
'tora no tamashii' would litteraly mean 'spirit of the tiger'.  <br/>
Toranokami would be pretty cool, but I don't know how well it would <br/>
fit in 'reality' since all of the ~no kamis were always preceeded by <br/>
the name of a province.<br/>

thanks to the person telling i might not be stupid ;)<br/>
actually i didn't want to start a fight or anything. The "kami" proposition was because spirit and god in french are two words with very similar meaning in french, and i thought i mitght be the same in your language. As i don't master it, i just wanted to be sure that what i would say might be taken as truth without double checking :)<br/>
