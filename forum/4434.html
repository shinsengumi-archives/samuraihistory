<h3>Ceramonial Drum</h3>

<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-187495980">I am looking for information about a type of drum that was used in <br/>
the film Heaven and Earth that was carried into battle in the film. I <br/>
am not sure if there is a historical reference to this, but a <br/>
wargaming company would like to add this item to their 15mm Samurai <br/>
range. Thanks in advance.<br/>
