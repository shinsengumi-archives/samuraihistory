<div id="ygrps-yiv-1769926642">Just wanted to share a little anecdote.  A few years back at the beginning <br/>
of my graduate study I was doing a report on something samurai-related and <br/>
contacted Prof. Karl Friday.  I had reached what I believed to be an <br/>
impasse and my poor level of Japanese did not seem to be up to the task of <br/>
poring over scads of kamakura-era texts in the time allotted for the <br/>
project.  In any event, after a few VERY helpful exchanges with Prof. <br/>
Friday pointing me in some interesting directions I made reference to a <br/>
history channel thing that he (and Cameron Hurst and Turnbull) appeared on <br/>
in support of something that I believed, and he said in no uncertain terms <br/>
that they had taken his comments out of context and edited the interview in <br/>
such a way that it appeared that he was espousing a viewpoint that was <br/>
actually nearly the opposite of what he actually believes.<br/>
