<div id="ygrps-yiv-510152255">Perhaps, but let us not forget that he did indeed<br/>
fight in quite a few battles himself, Sekigahara<br/>
included.  The fact that he fought on the losing side<br/>
and survived should at least speak of his ability to<br/>
survive.  Beyond that, I've read that he participated<br/>
in a few of Ieyasu's "closing" battles so to speak.  I<br/>
beleive Sekigahara was the battle to decide the rule<br/>
of the country, of course, but there's always a bit of<br/>
cleaning up to do after such battles.  Rebel factions,<br/>
the decimation of the Toyotomi family line, etc.<br/>
<br/>
This is nevermind the fact that being a great<br/>
swordsman and a great warrior do not always go hand in<br/>
hand.  To duel with a single or even multiple<br/>
opponents is something very differt from soldiering. <br/>
In personal duels you have many more options and more<br/>
oppertunities to make precision cuts than in a large<br/>
scale battle (reference: 45 year old opponent who<br/>
kicked a rock in my face before rushing me with a<br/>
kama-gusari!  You'd be hard pressed to do that in<br/>
battle!).<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1864154375">An often forgotten fact is that Musashi was at Sekigahara in 1600 where he fought for the Ashikaga <br/>
and the Osaka castle seiges (both of them 1614 and 1615) on the Tokugawa side, he also took part<br/>
in the Shimabara Rebellion of 1638 where he served on the field staff.<br/>
