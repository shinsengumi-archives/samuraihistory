<h3>Tozando and importing to the UK</h3>
by <i>ian_key</i>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1750828766">Hi,<br/>
<br/>
I have been listening in for about a month now and have obtained some<br/>
really useful information, but this is my first time post, so please<br/>
be gentle on me ;)  <br/>
<br/>
I am interested in getting both a sword and a bow. Not sure at the<br/>
moment if I want a shinken or iaito as I want to practice kata.  Does<br/>
anyone know about importing either of these items into the UK and what<br/>
problems might arise with customs and/or police?<br/>
<br/>
Cheers<br/>
<br/>
Ian</div>

<br/>
you will have no problems importing these itmes in to<br/>
the UK, the only thing that may happen which ahs<br/>
happened to me a few ties is that customs and excise<br/>
will slap some duty on the item.<br/>
<br/>
if you can ask tozando if your buying from there as<br/>
you name them in the subject header to mark the<br/>
package as a gift.<br/>
<br/>
Are you just starting training or have you been<br/>
training for a while, depending you may wish to<br/>
consider an Iaito before a shinken if doing kata, if<br/>
your wanting  a Bow, then your Kyudo sensei will know<br/>
the best source for cheaper items<br/>

<h3>Re: Tozando and importing to the UK</h3>

<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-415463770">Thanks everyone for the responses.  I posted onthis list, as questions<br/>
in the past had been about obtaining swords from Tozando, so assumed<br/>
prior knowledge by people.  Please feel free to suggest a more<br/>
suitable list.<br/>
<br/>
Barry, thanks for your email, I am looking into the To-ken society.<br/>
<br/>
I teach jiu-jitsu, we have sword kata in there for which we use a<br/>
bokken.  I have been fascinated by the Samurai for ages (martial arts<br/>
for 21 years!!), especially the sword and archery forms. <br/>
<br/>
Until today, I didn't know there were kyudo clubs in the UK! I have<br/>
found one in London which is close to me :) so will give that a try.<br/>
<br/>
Cheers<br/>
<br/>
Ian<br/>

<h3>Kyudo in the UK</h3>
by <i>deanwayland</i>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1418543595">Hi Ian,<br/>
<br/>
Earlier this year, I bought myself a yumi for use in combat archery,<br/>
while at the same time looking for someone to teach me about the early<br/>
techniques of the bow in war, a search which has had to be put on the<br/>
back burner for now. However, during my search I was very surprised to<br/>
find an excellent and "local" Kyudo club not far from myself here in<br/>
Stevenage, in the village of Cottered, North Hertfordshire, just off the<br/>
A1(M) Junction 9, run by a very friendly and competent chap named Adrian<br/>
Hall, his web site is at:<br/>
<br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.heijoshin.com/">http://www.heijoshin.com/</a><br/>
<br/>
Or you can contact him at:<br/>
<br/>
mailto://<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="mailto:adrian.hall@...">adrian.hall@...</a><br/>
<br/>
or phone him on 07885 061151<br/>
<br/>
(details taken from his web page)<br/>
<br/>
Hope you find this useful<br/>
<br/>
Yours<br/>
<br/>
Dean<br/>
