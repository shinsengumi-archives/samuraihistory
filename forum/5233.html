<h3>RE: [samuraihistory] Korea Vs. Japan history</h3>
by <i>Michael Peters</i>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1612977098">*Disclaimer* It's been 13 years since I studied Korean history.<br/>
<br/>
  The website seems to have 3 purposes. 1 to promote 1 person's (or small <br/>
group's) interpretation of history. Lots of nit-picks on different <br/>
interpretations of events. Getting 2 historians from the same culture (much <br/>
less historically hostile ones) to agree on anything historical is kind of <br/>
like herding cats anyway. 2 an attempt to denigrate all Japanese history <br/>
texts because Japan, while having owned up to some of the very negative <br/>
aspects of the Pacific war, has refused to simply roll over and paint <br/>
themselves as the demons many Koreans and Chinese believe they are. 3 Japan <br/>
bashing in general.<br/>
<br/>
  I am not defending the revisionist tendencies that DO occur in Japan <br/>
textbooks. The Korean page is so obviously slanted in such an anti-japanese <br/>
manner it is hard to take any of it seriously. Most Japanese are very <br/>
cognizant (sp?) of the many attrocities perpetrated by thier military in the <br/>
Pacific War. Teaching children that grandpa was a raping murdering demon is <br/>
unacceptable regardless of the wishes of Korea and China.<br/>

2 sources I'd check, both by Turnbull--his "Samurai<br/>
Invasion" is exclusively about Hideyoshi's invasion in<br/>
the 1590's, and "Samurai Warriors" has a great color<br/>
plate depicting Kato Kiyomasa in action against the<br/>
Koreans. If you can find it online, the War Museum in<br/>
Seoul has some great exhibits, but not sure if it has<br/>
a website. I just tried a quick google, but you may<br/>
have better luck. It's worth looking. <br/>

<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-2008216924">Dear Bob:<br/>
I am sorry to hear that you did not get any responses<br/>
from the War Museum in Seoul.<br/>
I presume that many people working at the War Museum<br/>
received training in the Chinese<br/>
Classics(confuciansim, literatures, history, and<br/>
military) so that they may not have some who are good<br/>
at foreign languages for communications.<br/>
<br/>
Unfortunately, I do not have my personal connection to<br/>
any particular groups in South Korea as I intend to<br/>
become an American citezen in a due time.<br/>
<br/>
One thing I can suggest is to contact historians and<br/>
social scientists in Seould National University,<br/>
Yonsei University, Korea University, and several other<br/>
primary universities in Seoul. I presume that many of<br/>
them studied in the United States, Great Britain,<br/>
France, and Germany so that their language skills will<br/>
be much better. (at least in writing)<br/>
Hopefully, you can find a few of them who are<br/>
interested in helping you.<br/>
<br/>
Another option is to check the following website:<br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.prkorea.com/">http://www.prkorea.com/</a><br/>
They are a civilian group who are interested in<br/>
teaching their history to foreigner.<br/>
<br/>
The last tip is to instigate their patriotism for<br/>
better responses. Although disorganized, they have<br/>
proved to become solid in times of crisis.<br/>
Please, let me know if there are any other things I<br/>
can do for you in my capacity.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
                         <br/>
<br/>
                       Sincerely,<br/>

  With all due respect. The text books they complain about are not books for <br/>
*us*. They are the texts for children in Japan. As for most of the medeival/ <br/>
ancient history points, I'd be far more inclined to believe real cites <br/>
rather than attempts to disprove through lack of data. Many koreans have a <br/>
severe dislike for Japan (with good reason), but I am as unlikely to pay <br/>
much attention to those who try to use history as a stick rather than a <br/>
learning tool as those who complain about prime-ministers visiting shrines.<br/>
  From my Korean history class, I DO remember lots of jockeying for <br/>
position/intrigue/fighting between the 3 kingdoms. Would the kingdoms have <br/>
banded together to face an outside threat? Possibly, even probably if the <br/>
threat were great enough. Would one of the kingdoms use outside troops in a <br/>
power play? Probably if they thought the cost benefit ratio were high <br/>
enough.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1627698213">Dear Michael:<br/>
I want to show my respect and appreciation for your<br/>
interest and contributions in the Korean history.<br/>
I do not deny that there exist bias among the Korean<br/>
historians and public in their interpretation and<br/>
presentation of records on the historical relations<br/>
between Japan and Korea.<br/>
<br/>
However, the establishment of the correlation between<br/>
the credibility of the Korean historical references<br/>
and the anti-Japanese sentiment among the Korean<br/>
public requires more solid logical evidences and<br/>
invesitgation.<br/>
It could have been much better if you came up with<br/>
some specific examples especially in the period of the<br/>
Japanese invasion during the Chosun dynasty.<br/>
After all, it is a little sensitive area among<br/>
Japanese, Chinese, and Koreans.<br/>
That's why I have consistently confined myself to<br/>
providing sources and information not usually<br/>
avaialalbe to some Westerners whenever the issues<br/>
involving the Korean history came up with regard to<br/>
the Japanese history.<br/>
<br/>
Korea needs many Western people like you as their<br/>
friends.....<br/>

Dear Bob:<br/>
I am sorry to hear that you did not get any responses<br/>
from the War Museum in Seoul.<br/>
I presume that many people working at the War Museum<br/>
received training in the Chinese<br/>
Classics(confuciansim, literatures, history, and<br/>
military) so that they may not have some who are good<br/>
at foreign languages for communications.<br/>
<br/>
Unfortunately, I do not have my personal connection to<br/>
any particular groups in South Korea as I intend to<br/>
become an American citezen in a due time.<br/>
<br/>
One thing I can suggest is to contact historians and<br/>
social scientists in Seould National University,<br/>
Yonsei University, Korea University, and several other<br/>
primary universities in Seoul. I presume that many of<br/>
them studied in the United States, Great Britain,<br/>
France, and Germany so that their language skills will<br/>
be much better. (at least in writing)<br/>
Hopefully, you can find a few of them who are<br/>
interested in helping you.<br/>
<br/>
Another option is to check the following website:<br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.prkorea.com/">http://www.prkorea.com/</a><br/>
They are a civilian group who are interested in<br/>
teaching their history to foreigner.<br/>
<br/>
The last tip is to instigate their patriotism for<br/>
better responses. Although disorganized, they have<br/>
proved to become solid in times of crisis.<br/>
Please, let me know if there are any other things I<br/>
can do for you in my capacity.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
                         <br/>
<br/>
                       Sincerely,<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
