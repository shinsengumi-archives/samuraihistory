<h3>Osprey Campaign Book - Kawanakajima</h3>

<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1272517563">I've just learned that Osprey has published a new Campaign book on <br/>
Kawanakajima (1553-1564).<br/>
<br/>
It's by Stephen Turnbull, so I'm assuming it's about Japan (correct me if I'm <br/>
wrong).<br/>
<br/>
Has anyone read it?  How is it?  Was this the last of the Medieval Japanese <br/>
battles or the first of the Renaissnace battles in Japan?<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1078696868">Turnbull also has a 'new' hardback book, 'Samurai - The World of the<br/>
Warrior' published by Osprey. I deliberately say 'new' in inverted commas,<br/>
because I wonder if there is anything genuinely new in the book - or is it<br/>
just a rehash of books already published?<br/>

Bob Burke wrote about the "forthcoming" book by Turnbull on Kawanakajima - I look forward to its I do with most new publications on our interests... However, a book with a similar title and format already exists. I bought it this year on my trip to the bi-annual Kulmbach Zinnfigur Boerse in Germany. Unfortunately it is in Polish!! Polish is as unintelligible to me as japanese - but then I enjoy the challenge.. but for polish readers worth a look.  Here is a review I put together:<br/>

<br/>
KAWANAKAJIMA 1561<br/>
<br/>
by : Witold Nowakowski illustrations: Piotr Prominski cost : apx 14 euro<br/>
<br/>
1561 was the year of the fourth battle at Kawanakajima between the two rivals, Takeda Shingen and Uesugi Kenshin, and one of the most bloodiest, in terms of casualties, of the 16th century. What makes this battle more of interest is that Shingen drew up his battle lines after nightfall and completed manouvers before first light. However, what should have been a surprise attack on the unwarry Uesugi was thwarted and instead the Takeda were subjected to the focus of attacks from a well practised tactical development by Kenshin.  Kenshin had been made aware of Shingens night movements and had undertaken his own placements under cover of the same darkness. The Takeda forces came under great presssure but held firm to "win" the day with a loss of around 14000, including many important family members and generals. The Uesugi losses were similar but accounted for a higher proportion of troops engaged.<br/>
<br/>
The book is one of a series of books, produced by Bellona [ http://ksiegarnia.bellona.pl]and published in Poland - in polish, discussing the background and the events leading up to the warfare. "Kawanakajima 1561" is well illustrated with colour artwork, maps and prints in a format similar to Osprey but slightly smaller [160x235] - cosisting of 48 pages of which 8 are in full colour. The new artwork is reminiscient of Angus McBride's style [almost identical] with the figures represented being rather squat and short. The work relies heavily on previously work published in Osprey - Turnbull and Bryant - and the red book Rekishi Series. An ideal book for readers who would find reading Polish easier than English. However, Stephen Turnbull is due to publish an Osprey Campaign Series later this year tittled "Kawanakajima 1553-64". {truely SRT has been very busy with the pen this last year!}<br/>

{Here is the AMAZON pre publication notes on this.}<br/>
<br/>
TURNBULL Paperback; November 25 2003; 96 pages; ISBN: 1841765627 £12.99<br/>
<br/>
Kawanakajima is unique in history. In the space of 12 years, between 1553 and 1564, this valley deep in the mountains of central Japan witnessed no less than five battles between two of Japan's greatest warlords. Takeda Shingen and Uesugi Kenshin were both descended from great families and were highly skilled tacticians. Both had taken the tonsure and risen to high rank in their respective Buddhist sects. When Shingen attempted to seize control of Shinano province they were set on a collision course. Stephen Turnbull chronicles the see-saw struggle between two men who epitomize the warrior daimyo from Japan's 'Warring States' period. <br/>

<h3>Re: [samuraihistory] Osprey Campaign Book - Kawanakajima</h3>
by <i>ltdomer98</i>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-2014967286">How can you not have ever heard of Kawanakajima??<br/>
<br/>
Kawanakajima was the site of several battles between<br/>
Takeda Shingen and Uesugi Kenshin. The 4th Battle of<br/>
Kawanakajima, usually the one considered THE battle,<br/>
took place in 1561. Great battle to study, with lots<br/>
of tactical point-counterpoint, at one point allegedly<br/>
Uesugi Kenshin led a charge into the Takeda<br/>
headquarters and swung at Shingen, who parried with<br/>
his war-fan (whether this happened or not, it's been<br/>
the subject of much artwork). <br/>
<br/>
go to the Samurai Archives website, I know a better<br/>
description is in there. As to "medieval" versus<br/>
"pre-modern", do you mean "chusei" versus "kinsei"?<br/>
I'm not familiar with the use of medieval and<br/>
pre-modern with the exception of in translation of<br/>
those two terms. Kawanakajima wasn't a watershed<br/>
battle like Nagashino or Sekigahara, just a really<br/>
good one to study from a military history standpoint. <br/>
