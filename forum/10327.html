After Japan closed its borders and kicked the Christian missionaries out of Japan, it was forced to undertake a national maritime defense to protect against any potential foreign threats. In this podcast, we examine the defense of the port of Nagasaki, from the political and military structure to the actual defenses constructed at the port. We also examine the successes and failures that occurred in Nagasaki, starting with the torching of a Portuguese ship and execution of most of its sailors in 1640, to the drastic failure to defend the port against the British Navy ship Phaeton in 1808.<br/>

Being out of the studio this time around we had a little crazy airplane noise and water rushing through pipes for a few minutes, otherwise the sound quality is good - so hopefully the content will make up for a few minutes of background noise!</div>
