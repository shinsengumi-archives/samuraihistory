       I was just going through the archives looking for an old thread I <br/>

 </span></blockquote>Yes that's another good point. All the more reason why it's impossible <br/>
to pin down or to list up "the" 24 generals.<br/>
<br/>
Two more reasons: 1) he didn't keep an official roster or anything <br/>
like that; 2) the notion of Shingen's 24 generals became popular in <br/>
the Edo period, long after Shingen had died.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Perhaps you are right. But, I'm not sure that this assumption really <br/>
holds up. And of course it depends on what you mean by things like <br/>
"modern" and "lost". By modern I'll guess you mean the Meiji <br/>
Restoration. <br/>
<br/>
But - that was only roughly 150 years ago - the same timeframe as the <br/>
US civil war. Many of us personally may know an elderly person who, wh<br/>
en they were young, knew people who were alive during this period.<br/>
<br/>
I personally don't think that so many customs and stories have been <br/>
lost to the mists of time during this period of two living memories.<br/>
<br/>
Rather, the situation with Shingen seems less poetic and much more <br/>
pedestrian. He himself didn't have a roster of 24 of his top generals.<br/>
 The notion came up many many years later. So, there's just different <br/>
versions of who the 24 really are that were created over time.<br/>
