<div id="ygrps-yiv-1957071365">I want to thank Tom Helms (as always!) for his insightful contribution to our <br/>
work;  gracias also in order to Donovan-- I liked his songs too --rofl.  I <br/>
believe that with the interest at hand,  we can consider this the founding of a <br/>
subgroup specifically on Japanese Arms and Armour.   Since there is so much in <br/>
museums on these subjects,  like the Metropolitan Museum in New York and the <br/>
Victoria and Albert Museum in London,  I think we have a precedent here.  <br/>
Speaking of armor, you  can't beat the two books by H.  Russell Robinson,  <br/>
Oriental Armor and   Japanese Arms and Armor.  They have stood the passage of time as <br/>
 splendid chronicles of the Age of the Country at War.  Japanese Arms and <br/>
Armor is--of and in itself--a work of art!  I extend a courteous invitation to <br/>
Tom Helm and to Donovan to bring their research to the attention of the group.  <br/>
And as Tom Bodett said about Motel 6,  "we'll leave the light on for ya."  <br/>
Later and greater,   Jack Murphy<br/>
