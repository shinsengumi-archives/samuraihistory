<h3>Ninja Garb</h3>
by <i>Scott19NY</i>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1581615754">I have been lurking durring this ninja discusion ans kept my mouth <br/>
closed about the subject but I decided to say somethign about what <br/>
they wore.  9 times out of 10 an agent doing ninja type assingments <br/>
would dress as a normal person.  Not only that they would assume the <br/>
entire identity with false papers and other items that would be <br/>
needed to get through checkpoints, and other such things, when there <br/>
was time to make them.  When a ninja would wear something similar to <br/>
what we now consider a ninja uniform it was almost never black.  The <br/>
point was to conceal oneself so moving through the forrest in the <br/>
daytime in a back outfit doesn't make sence.  Even at night time they <br/>
would rarely wear black.  Unless it was a night of a new moon or the <br/>
clouds completely coverefd the moon jet balck clothes would stand out <br/>
if there was a little bit of light from the moon.  So usually for <br/>
night missons when the "ninja uniform" was worn it work be a dark <br/>
gray, dark blue, a darn brown, or other dark colors.  One more thing <br/>
but not about garb.  There is a good article at www.koryu.com written <br/>
by Dr. Karl Friday called "Is Ninjutsu a Koryu".  Dr. Friday holds a <br/>
Menkyo Kaiden in Kashima Shinto Ryu (one of the oldest samurai styles <br/>
still around), and a PhD in History.</div>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1447457219">Hi<br/>
<br/>
the problem with the koryu.com article is that it is<br/>
not entirely accurate. it has been discussed to death<br/>
over on www.e-budo.com. Unfortunately the article is<br/>
based on myth and is very biased towards those who are<br/>
hardcore Koryu. Most of the references made directly<br/>
or indrirectly towards modern ninjutsu and the<br/>
bujinkan have been dispelled.<br/>
<br/>
I personally would not use that article as a reference<br/>
