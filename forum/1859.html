  I'm gonna throw my two cents in (for what they're not really worth :-)!).  <br/>
I have really not been paying attention much, b/c I've seen a lot of crap that <br/>
has come in, so I agree with the other three.  Something needs to be done.  <br/>
8-)  Thanx, y'all.  8-)<br/>

I must say...<br/>
I am not against people talking about 11 September, Islam atrocities, etc<br/>
But it MUST have something to do with the topic.<br/>
<br/>
In this diggest, I saw people advocating kristendoom, saying things pro and<br/>
against it, or islam, or etc etc etc and all things related with the middle<br/>
eastern world. However I ask as well...<br/>
<br/>
Whaddya HEL *giggles* it have to do with Samurai History?!?!?!?<br/>
