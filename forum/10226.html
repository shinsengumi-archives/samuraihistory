<h3>The skinny on swords into and out of Japan</h3>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1874212547">Greetings,<br/>
<br/>
I'm a budoka:  I do battodo, iaido, and related arts.  I bring swords<br/>
into and out of Japan, and for the most part what people have said<br/>
about it is true.<br/>
<br/>
1) You cannot bring non-Japanese "steel" swords into Japan.  You can<br/>
get them into your luggage on your plane, but you will need to open it<br/>
up at customs.  First, they will ask you want they are for.  Next,<br/>
they will do the magnet test.  If the magnet sticks, then there is<br/>
iron (assumption is steel, but we won't go into the metallurgy right<br/>
now) and the sword has to be verified (see below).  If the magnet<br/>
doesn't stick, it is a "mogito" (literally a fake sword) and you<br/>
should be fine.<br/>
<br/>
2) If there is iron/steel in the sword then you will need to justify<br/>
having it.  There are several reasons you could bring it,<br/>
legitimately:<br/>
   a) It is a traditional Japanese sword (Nihonto) and you are a<br/>
legitimate practitioner of a Japanese sword art or sword society.<br/>
They will want some kind of documentation as to its (and your)<br/>
legitimacy.  Here's where you get your senior sword practitioners or<br/>
society members to vouch for you.  Note:  Just because it is a<br/>
Japanese sword doesn't mean it will be allowed in.  Mumei gunto (war<br/>
swords with no signature) are likely to be stopped.  Likewise, some<br/>
smiths have been accused of using unorthodox practices, and their<br/>
swords are questionable/rejected, now, when they are discovered.  This<br/>
happened to my instructor when he went back for training.<br/>
  b) You are bringing it in for work.  If you are getting fittings<br/>
made or having someone polish the blade, you can often get the sword<br/>
through customs with help from the person doing the work.  It is not<br/>
legal to actually use the sword in Japan, however, and if you aren't<br/>
there as a tourist I don't know that they will want you to keep the<br/>
sword.<br/>
<br/>
If you bring a sword that doesn't meet their criteria, you could find<br/>
yourself in the position of either having it held at the airport until<br/>
you leave or having it confiscated.  I can't tell you why the latter<br/>
would happen, but I wouldn't chance it, myself.  I'd make sure that I<br/>
was in contact with a legitimate person in Japan who could tell me<br/>
whether or not I could bring the items in question with me or not.<br/>
<br/>
Hope that helps.<br/>
