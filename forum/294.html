<h3>Gohatto and UK release dates.</h3>
by <i>fifthchamber@aol.com</i>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1113565999">I also think that Gohatto is definately one of the best Japanese Samurai <br/>
films that I have ever seen and cannot recommend it enough. The scenery and <br/>
the acting are incredibly beautiful, from Kitano's roughened old Bushi <br/>
through to the final Sakura (cherry blossom) and the way that it is lit for <br/>
the final scenes...<br/>
 The question that I have is wether anyone out there has heard of any release <br/>
dates for the film on (region 2-PAL, UK playable) DVD yet? I am aware that it <br/>
has been offered already on Amazon etc. but have not heard anything about <br/>
it's UK release dates....Till then.<br/>

<br/>
I recently bought this  movie gohatto from hong kong<br/>
and was expecting some great fight scenes.  While the<br/>
fight scenes in this movie are good there are not alot<br/>
of them.  The story was very good and I was not<br/>
disapointed but just thought I would give the heads up<br/>
to those interested<br/>
