<h3>Tokugawa descendents</h3>
by <i>holydemon13</i>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1259131518">Hey.<br/>
       Just wondering something: do any members of the Tokugawa family still <br/>
exist?  Or did the name die out with the death of the last (former) Shogun, <br/>
Yoshinobu, in 1913?  Same thing, and this will probably sound really, REALLY <br/>
stupid, but does anyone know if the Oda or Toyotomi family names have survived <br/>
into the present day?<br/>
       And Tony, I'm not offended by your comment about the books.  They're <br/>
one of only two mystery series I can stand myself, the other being Janet <br/>
Evanovich's Stephanie Plum series.  I normally read romance, although I'm trying to <br/>
branch out this year and read different authors and genres.<br/>
       Take care.  8-D<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Oh, heck. There are scads of Tokugawa out there.<br/>
<br/>
One of the ladies being courted at one time by the current Crown Prince was a <br/>
Tokugawa. The Toyotomi were annihilated in 1615, and there are lots of Oda out <br/>
there.<br/>
<br/>

 </span></blockquote>The trouble is, it's hard to find good historic Japan lit in English. The market <br/>
is small, and the trap is to explain *enough* so that people unfamiliar will <br/>
understand the concepts while not turning off the handful of people who *do* <br/>
understand and want the lit.<br/>
<br/>
I'm currently working on a novel that leads up to Sekigahara (in my copious <br/>
spare time <wry g>) which I would describe as a Japanese version of "Killer Angels."<br/>

<h3>positive and negative traits</h3>
by <i>dateyukiie</i>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-2140600537">Thiago,<br/>
Konnichi wa, tomodachi<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> > <br/>

 </span></blockquote>Addressing negative traits are as important as addressing <br/>
positive ones in a sincere discussion about any topic.<br/>
<br/>
I too enjoy a good discussion, and though I pointed out some of <br/>
the negative traits, I also agree that there were many positive <br/>
ones.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> > Perhaps another interesting aspect may be retrieved from the <br/>
 </span></blockquote>"Last Samurai" motion picture. It is clear that the movie suggests <br/>
the rebellion were being lead in order to preserve tradition and <br/>
honor (the Emperor´s counselours are portraied as greedy and <br/>
selfish, whereas the "Samurai" are only honour bound). <br/>
However, how absurd is conceiving the rebellion as a device to <br/>
attempt return to the "status quo"? Certainly, the "Samurai", as a <br/>
class, knew they would lose their prestige and power with the <br/>
Restoration and the open trade (before the Emperor, the <br/>
Tokugawa Bafuku agreed on trade terms). Would they be fighting <br/>
for their status rather by just simple plain honour?<br/>
<br/>
Being the perpetual optimist I tent to be, I would like to think that <br/>
the leaders of the time - from the daimyo down the chain to the <br/>
"simple" samurai, had not only their own interests in mind, but <br/>
those of their support mechanisms ie:the pesants and <br/>
merchants. This was, and is not always the case, of course.<br/>
<br/>
Even the most dull of samurai should have been aware of the <br/>
times - trade was increasing and merchants were rising in real, <br/>
if not "official" power, even as in modern times. Communication <br/>
was better than it ever was, which was increasing the education <br/>
of the people.<br/>
In earlier days, I can see how a public that had little <br/>
communication between han and city might not be aware of the <br/>
plight of others around their immediate surroundings.<br/>
It was in the controlling governments interest to maintain an <br/>
imposed "quarantine" so their authority could not be challenged.<br/>
Since the movie does not actually portray the actual Satsuma <br/>
rebellion, I cringe slightly to suppose what the motives for those <br/>
"samurai" really could be.<br/>
<br/>
Any person in charge of a group of people might resent, to a <br/>
small or large degree,when someone or something threatens to <br/>
remove their power. For the samurai, I believe this to be so.<br/>
They may have had honor as a partial motive - it would seem <br/>
dis-honorable to be removed from a public position. They may <br/>
have viewed any particular actions they took to defend their <br/>
income as a necessity, and not really saw anything wrong in <br/>
their methods, so it may have not occured to them to try to <br/>
cultivate some sort of middle ground between the government <br/>
position, and their own. <br/>
They tried to give it the "my way or the tokaido way..." treatment.<br/>
<br/>
As to the ministers and the councel being portrayed as greedy - <br/>
but the Samurai position as being honor bound and nobel <br/>
seems to be a typical literary mechanism to buy the sympathies <br/>
of the reader (or viewer...) They could not have showed the <br/>
samurai chastizing merchants and exacting tax money from <br/>
starving peasants in the first minutes of the film and keep people <br/>
interested in the samurai for long. That would have led to a <br/>
rebellion right there in the theater!! :-)<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> > <br/>

hand.<br/>
<br/>
How can I, or anyone else take intelligent discussion as <br/>
offensive! I hope I did not sound that way...<br/>
