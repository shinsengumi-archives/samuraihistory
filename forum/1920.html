<h3>NHK Taiga TV Series</h3>
by <i>trokoshea</i>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1610978842">Hi everyone,<br/>
<br/>
I live in Montreal, Quebec and would like to get a copy of some historical <br/>
series made by NHK Taiga (Takeda Shingen, Oda Nobunaga, Date, Môri, ...).<br/>
<br/>
My questions:<br/>
1-Are they available in NTSC VHS tapes or zone 1 DVD format?<br/>
2-If yes to #1, who should I contact to make the purchase?<br/>
3-If no to #1, are they just available?<br/>
<br/>
Any advice is welcome as I have no idea of where to begin the search.<br/>
<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-294211289">Japan uses the same VCR tapes as N. America (i.e. not PAL format), <br/>
but the DVDs are another region.  You could buy a 'region free' DVD <br/>
player that plays DVDs from anywhere.  I have one and it works <br/>
great.  I don't believe there are any Taiga drama available outside <br/>
Japan.  I've called various Japanese language stations in the past, <br/>
and they all say NHK holds the rights, so they can't sell them.  <br/>
Otherwise your only bet is to find someone who actually has them who <br/>
would be willing to record them for you.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Yes, they're NTSC -- but the DVDs are Region 2 (you'd need a region-free<br/>
player).<br/>
<br/>
They're also nauseatingly expensive. It's amazing the cost of DVDs and videos in<br/>
Japan. For example: Onmyoji is being released here on DVD in two months. It's<br/>
less than $23 for the deluxe edition with documentaries and all that. The same<br/>
edition in Japan is about 5400 yen -- over twice the price.<br/>
<br/>
If you want to order them, you can from Amazon.co.jp (the Japanese Amazon). They<br/>
have a button you can hit to get English readings. The rest of the interface is<br/>
identical to the American version, so even if you can't read Japanese, that<br/>
shouldn't be too hard. Note, though, that you can't get whole NHK series --<br/>
they're 52 hours long. They have a digest version that's usually three or four<br/>
tapes, but will cost you about 30-40 bucks per tape. You can also buy full sets,<br/>
IIRC, from NHK's website, but they cost about 500 bucks for a series.<br/>

I have a lot of them on tape some the full 49/50 episode, others condensed.<br/>
I made copies of them before but they came out lousy. Also its all in<br/>
Japanese with no subtitles.</div>
