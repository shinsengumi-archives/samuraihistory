 </span></blockquote>Cool! I figured the metric system had completely taken over. Thanks.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Maurice of Nassau was mucking with linear tactics in 1584 as well as <br/>
uniform drills and the like, before then starting around 1500, Gonzalo <br/>
invents the prototype for what becomes the Tercio. This is a roughly <br/>
half pike and gun formation of about 1 to 3,000 men. I don't know if <br/>
they volleyed, but they did keep up a continous fire. My references <br/>
don't give enough details to be sure but sometime prior to 1584 might <br/>
not be too rash.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Sounds like an interesting book, but this description sounds like what <br/>
the Europeans were already doing with the Tercio and their multiple <br/>
ranks of arquebusers. They would fall back to reload inside the pikes <br/>
while their fellows sallied out to fire again.<br/>
<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Yes, the gunners in a Tercio cannot all fire at once, period! They are <br/>
several ranks deep and the earlier weapons required forks to rest on <br/>
which means you can't even have a kneeling rank along with a standing <br/>
rank. Also drill until roughly the 1590's was kind of a hit or miss affair.</div>
