<h3>Forms of address</h3>
by <i>thomas5403</i>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-943563540">I'm seeking clarification on forms of address within samurai <br/>
circles in the late Sengoku era.<br/>
<br/>
Was "san" used in this period?<br/>
<br/>
What is the proper usage of the term "sama"? I know it's used <br/>
following a name, but then so is "dono" and "tono" (or are they <br/>
two spellings of the same word).<br/>
<br/>
Recently I've been informed of "oyakata-sama".<br/>
<br/>
I'm working on a fiction piece, and trying to get the forms of <br/>
address right, so a broadside of questions if anyone's got the <br/>
time or inclination to answer:<br/>
<br/>
Form of address between samurai of equal status but different <br/>
han.<br/>
<br/>
Form used by samurai of equal status with in same han.<br/>
<br/>
Form used by commoners addressing samurai.<br/>
<br/>
Form used by samurai referring to his lord (to his lord).<br/>
<br/>
Form used by samurai referring to his lord (to another samurai <br/>
- either within or outside the han).<br/>
<br/>
Form used by samurai referring to another's lord.<br/>
<br/>
I think you get the idea.<br/>
<br/>
Any help appreciated,<br/>
<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-696321520">Here's my guess based on years of watching NHK taiga dramas (and <br/>
since a little knowledge is a dangerous thing, hopefully there will <br/>
be others here to confirm or deny my thoughts).<br/>
<br/>
I don't recall hearing ~San, but I do remember hearing ~Han used on <br/>
Samurai in Sengoku period Kyoto/Kansai, so ~San might have been in <br/>
use in other places...(?)<br/>
<br/>
Tono or Oyakatasama seems to be used to address a lord directly (from <br/>
samurai to lord), and I think Tono-sama is used to refer to the lord <br/>
when talking to someone else (I don't know the difference in usage <br/>
between Oyakatasama and Tono when speaking to a lord, but I think <br/>
Oyakatasama is even more polite (or puts the lord higher up) <br/>
than 'Tono'.... <br/>
<br/>
I think that when 'equal' samurai speak with each other, they seem to <br/>
stick ~Dono on the end (Hayashi-dono) etc.  And I think -Sama is used <br/>
this way as well.<br/>
All this goes for higher up samurai, as most Taiga drama and others <br/>
mainly deal with that level. I have no idea how ashigaru address each <br/>
other.  <br/>
<br/>
hopefully others here can clarify - now I'm curious. But another <br/>
option in fiction would be to scrap the Japanese titles altogether <br/>
and use the english equivalents (Lord Hayashi) (Yes, my lord) stuff <br/>
like that...<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-744366786">Those are pretty much my guesses as well.  I'd just add that "Oyakata-<br/>
sama" seems to be used by lower ranking samurai towards thier lord <br/>
where "Tono" seems to be used by the higher ranking samurai towards <br/>
the lord. but I'm also basing my guesses on the various japanese <br/>
samurai drama I've seen. <br/>
<br/>
I KNOW there are others here who should be able to hazzard a guess as <br/>
well....! (Including at least a small handful of people who have <br/>
actually read sengoku-era documents)<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1965526554">Hi there.<br/>
  I know my info is based on a historically-questionable (the major human <br/>
characters actually lived, but the events in the game didn't happen) video <br/>
game set in Japan during the Sengoku Jidai, but it may prove helpful: In <br/>
Oni-musha I: Warlords (PlayStation 2), the character Kinoshita Tokichiro <br/>
(later Toyotomi Hideyoshi) addresses the hero, Samanosuke Akechi (real name: <br/>
Akechi Mitsuharu, titled Samanosuke) as "Samanosuke-dono".  At the time, the <br/>
then-Tokichiro was a low servant of Nobunaga, and doubtful would have been a <br/>
full samurai (if such ranks existed), while Samanosuke was a ronin.  Now, how <br/>
this helps, and how much, I don't know, but I thought I'd mention it anyway.  <br/>
(-:<br/>
<br/>
