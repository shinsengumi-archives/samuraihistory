 </span></blockquote>This is not limited to Japan, the 'Wild West' and other periods have <br/>
this issue as well. I call it the 'Sir Walter Scott' effect though it <br/>
goes back even further in history than that.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Give them to Tony along with a flensing knive? Change the group name to <br/>
something so obscure that nobody can find it? Force people to take a <br/>
langauge test showing that they can write in their native tongue? Have <br/>
them prove that they have read the FAQ? We have moderators when it comes <br/>
down to extremes.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>That requires communication both ways. Some people require an <br/>
application of brute force for this to occur. I haven't found the 'beat' <br/>
key on my computer yet, but if I ever do, I'm going back to books!<br/>
