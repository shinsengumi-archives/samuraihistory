<br/>
Check out the "Japanese Camps" and "Camp Curtains"<br/>
sections. <br/>
<br/>
Unfortunately, not many movies about the Muromachi<br/>
period are available outside of Japan--it's not a<br/>
period that holds a lot of fascination for foreigners,<br/>
it seems. Can't imagine why not, but alas. That said,<br/>
I don't think things changed significantly before,<br/>
during, or after the Muromachi. Most of your movies<br/>
focusing on either the Sengoku-Jidai (tail end of the<br/>
Muromachi anyways) or even as far back as the Gempei<br/>
War would be worth checking out to get ideas and feel.<br/>
'Ran', 'Kagemusha', 'Fuurin Kazan' (in the States as<br/>
'Samurai Banners'), etc. all have scenes that take<br/>
place in military camps. The best visual<br/>
representation would likely be in Taiga drama--1996's<br/>
Hideyoshi, for example, probably has one or two camp<br/>
scenes per episode. 1997's Mori Motonari, 1990(?)<br/>
Nobunaga, King of Zipangu, or the Tokugawai Aoi Sandai<br/>
or Toshiie to Matsu (forget the years) would all be<br/>
fairly recent ones that should have many many scenes<br/>
that would help to give you an idea. <br/>
<br/>
If there is a Japanese food store or market near you,<br/>
they may have video rentals (I watched half of Toshiie<br/>
to Matsu's 50 episodes in 2 weeks when I was in Kansas<br/>
City for business one time) where you can find these. <br/>

  I went to the website you recommended.  Anthony Bryant has obviously <br/>
done a lot of research.  Unfortunately, his site doesn't give any <br/>
pictures.<br/>
<br/>
  I sat through "Ran" on Wewdensday night.  Though the openeing scenes <br/>
have an encampmnet surrounded by beautiful jinmaku (camp curtains), <br/>
there was never a tent shown.  According to Mr Bryant, they  usually <br/>
took over some neighboring Temple or hous to sleep in. <br/>
<br/>
  I would think that they would also have tents of some sort.  I'll <br/>
keep lookking, but I would appreciate any other "leads" or information <br/>
that anyone out there might be able to provide.  <br/>

 </span></blockquote>If they took over a temple, why would they need a<br/>
tent? If you're recreating a footsoldier, then likely<br/>
they had tents--anybody important would have<br/>
commandeered a temple or someone else's house, just<br/>
like Tony says. <br/>

    You're right.  I did miss the site specifically meant <br/>

     One quick question for you...You suggest that, historically, the <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-148685947">The problem is finding that house or temple to take over at a <br/>
particular event.  Usually the locals aren't to keen to just let you <br/>

Seriously, I belong to a Medieval Group that tries to recreate periods <br/>

answer questions from the general public, we're expected to be as <br/>
historically accurate as we can and to be able to answer questions.  <br/>

I've decided trying to recreate a late Muromachi Period encampament and <br/>
need to make it look as realistic as possible (cost and safety will <br/>
also be factors)<br/>

As for the common foot soldier.  I'd bet he found just about anyplace <br/>

solid wooden supports -- somewhere in the area of 2x4s -- and simple <br/>
bamboo wouldn't hold up something like that. So it's one of those <br/>

that is about it. If you were sufficiently rich and there were no <br/>

in a panelized hut set up for the evening by your servants. Hideyoshi <br/>

<blockquote><span title="ireply"> > <br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>You are right.  There is very little evidence of the use of Japanese <br/>
using tents at all - one way or the other - either in books, or <br/>
scrolls or T.V or film.  However, I find it somewhat hard to believe <br/>
that they "never" slept in their tents or take them to use <br/>
as "command posts".  In my years of studying history from various <br/>
parts of the world, I've found that just because there <br/>
isn't "evidence" that a particular thing was done, it more often than <br/>
not doesn't mean that it wasn't done either.  It has also been very <br/>
interesting to note that things that were spouted as "fact" twenty <br/>
years ago, are sometimes proven to be "fiction".  It's one of the <br/>
reasons why I LOVE history!<br/>
<br/>
I belong to a group of historical enthusiasts...Not the SCA....and I <br/>
intend to set up a Japanese Feudal Age encampment that is as accurate <br/>
as possible. (I will probably start out small, and expand as i go.) I <br/>
and the other members in my household, need a place out of the sun <br/>
and weather (since where I live is humid and rainy in the summer - <br/>
kind of like Japan.).  I also need a place that will allow me to <br/>
protect weaponry and yoroi (as well as hide other non-historical <br/>
period stuff like cots and sleeping bags when necessary.) from prying <br/>
eyes, inquistive hands and those same weather elements.  <br/>
<br/>
Lastly, when the public comes through the encampment, I want them to <br/>
say "oooh!" and "Ahhhh!".  When they ask questions, they'll get the <br/>
information like you just gave me regarding the use of the akunoya.  <br/>
When they leave for the day, and the site closes down to the public, <br/>
I need a place to lay my head and prepare for the next day.  Though <br/>
perhaps historically inaccurate, I'll probably be sleeping in the <br/>
akunoya out of convenience and neccessity.  (I don't think the local <br/>
Baptist church would take kindly to my riding up in full yoroi and <br/>
kicking them out so I have a place for me and my samurai to stay ;-<br/>
)  ) <br/>

not really be in the right places to replicate what we know of <br/>
akunoya from iconographic evidence. If you are more industrious, why <br/>
not buy lumber and make the frame yourself?<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> > <br/>
 </span></blockquote>I agree with you  - in principle - that using a carport is not very <br/>
palatable.  Unfortunately, we have to live in today's day and age and <br/>
I have to be concerned with ease of set up and take down, <br/>
transportability, structural integrity and safety.  Though I like the <br/>
idea of using real lumber for the framework, I don't have the luxury <br/>
of having a team of skilled Japanese carpenters who can produce <br/>
historically accurate joinery or the desire to transport the weight <br/>
of the frame work alone. (The truck I use to transport my encampment <br/>
will only hold so much in both cubic space and in weight and I don't <br/>
even want to go into the logistical challenges that are added when I <br/>
bring the horses and all of their accoutrements.) <br/>
<br/>
Rest assured, that I will do a very good job of "covering" the poles <br/>
and they will look just like wood (from far away).  I was originally <br/>
thinking of using bamboo to cover the metal poles. (I have alot of it <br/>
available and could hollow it out to cover the poles.) BUT Tony said <br/>
that was definitely "out" so I'm thinking of other ways to cover the <br/>
poles to make them look like "wood framing".<br/>
<br/>
I'll also look closely at the spacing of the vertical supports that <br/>
hold up the top. (Along with the correct width of the fabric.)<br/>
<br/>
I was hoping to have discussions like this and welcome your insight <br/>
and experience.  If you have any pictures or drawings of what that <br/>
joinery looked like, I'd appreciate it.  If you have access to book <br/>
titles so I have research documentation to support my endeavors, <br/>
that's even better.  Anything that will add to the great information <br/>
available on Tony's site would be helpful.<br/>

Quite apart from images of akunoya from the TV mini-series "Shougun". <br/>
you should understand that these things generally show up in paintings <br/>

only place that akunoya have shown up in any of them. Recently, someone <br/>
else found a depiction of a shelter which supposably could be set up by <br/>
ashigari. I you rumage around over on tosandou you should be able to <br/>
find it, Even this is a bit problematic as they are generally not <br/>
depicted.</div>

<br/>
Do a web search on "akunoya" and you will probably find something. <br/>
However, do not expect to find "Japanese Tents" particularly suitable <br/>
for what you probably intend. The akunoya is the most commodious <br/>
alternative, but I know of no evidence supporting the notion that <br/>
people made a habit of sleeping in the things. There are a couple of <br/>
shelter alternatives which may have been used by some ashigari on <br/>
campaign, but I doubt that you will want to actually use one of these. <br/>
They appear to be essentially a low roughly tubular structure of bent <br/>
bamboo lashed together with mino (straw rain capes) thrown over and <br/>
maybe a bit of matting unrolled on the ground inside. Some Japanese <br/>
books on sengoku jidai campaigns suggest that low ranking bushi may <br/>
have huddled under tate (large shields) or even in holes dug into <br/>
embankments. If you had rank, then you took over a neighboring temple <br/>
or something like that. There are also some suggestions of nagaya being <br/>
set up for some of the troops.</div>

I'm afraid that carport poles really do not pass the man on a galloping <br/>
horse test even when covered with contact paper. My family used to camp <br/>
in a WW-II army surplus army command tent. We only had a 49 Ford at the <br/>
time. The army tent had wooden poles. You can deal with wooden poles <br/>
too.</div>

 </span></blockquote>I NEVER intended to cover the poles with contact paper. (that would <br/>
just look "tacky".  I intended to "replace" them or cover them with <br/>
bamboo (By hollowing out the bamboo pole and placing the metal <br/>
carport pole inside the bamboo shell.)  However, Tony said that was <br/>
inappropriate.  <br/>
<br/>
your idea of Army Surplus tent poles is a good one.  (I wish I had <br/>
thought of it since I remember putting those monstrosities up <br/>
myself.)  any idea wheer I can find some or BETTER yet, know where I <br/>
can actually purchsea "real" akunoya?</div>

Becoming a hermit is not particularly tragic in Japan. It has been <br/>
viewed as virtuous since at least the Heian period. Frequently, the <br/>
tragedy occurs before becoming a hermit, but that does not make <br/>
actually being a hermit particularly tragic. Now then, there are some <br/>
famous persecuted Buddhist monks, but that is another matter. And, <br/>
these folks are also often heroes. Now being an exile is another <br/>
matter. Heike Monogatari can get positively wheepy about exiles.</div>
