<h3>Hello...</h3>
by <i>Moses</i>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-675202423">I just wanted to send out a quick greeting to everyone on the list.  My<br/>
name is Moses and I am looking forward to some interesting discussion.<br/>
Up to this point I have only read Hagakure but I am looking to expand my<br/>
knowledge of the samurai as far as is possible.<br/>
<br/>
I am a senior Literature major so any books that you can recommend to me<br/>
I would be more than happy to read.  Hoping for good things.  Thanks.<br/>
