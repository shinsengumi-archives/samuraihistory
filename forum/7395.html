Hi<br/>
<br/>
considering 10 years ago Yurnbull wrote a bigger book<br/>
on the Ninja this one was a seriously pathetic attempt<br/>
at just making money<br/>
<br/>
He has taken comic book principles bits of hollywood<br/>
and tried to pass it off as Ninja related material.<br/>
<br/>
I was shocked to see that he states that Ninja carried<br/>
straight bladed swords. He obviously has done no<br/>
research whatsoever into anything regarding ninja<br/>
weapons, and he definately has not had any timeon his<br/>
hands to read forums etc. <br/>
The straight ninja sword was 100% debunked by members<br/>
of the Ninjutsu training community 15 years ago, with<br/>
the source of that creation going back to Steve Hayes.<br/>
<br/>
I was given the book as a gift and I wish I could have<br/>
given it back. <br/>
<br/>
I wouldnt waste my money on it<br/>
<br/>

As I look through the book I see that the artist drew<br/>
a picture of a square tsuba style sword in one panal<br/>
but also shows katana in the very next panal. <br/>
Turnbull makes a point to mention katana, although on<br/>
page 18 under the heading of "<br/>
Standard ninja equipment" he says "... for convenience<br/>
the ninja would choose a blade that was shorter and<br/>
straighter then usual."<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I do not know what standard equipment would be. I've read a lot of <br/>
different stuff about ninja. Although if you think about it a shorter <br/>
sword would be lighter to carry. I read somewhere (don't know if its <br/>
true or not) that ninja would carry a short sword with a longer saya. <br/>
Ninja would fill the bottom of the saya with blinding powders or <br/>
somethings like that. Or the bottom of the saya could detach and be <br/>
used as a snorkel. Again I say I do not know if that is fact or not.</div>

HI<br/>
<br/>
Having been involvedinthe Ninja/ninjutsu martial arts<br/>
side of the world for the past 20 years, including<br/>
paying for books by Okuse to be translated, I would<br/>
have to disagree with you.<br/>
<br/>
Turnbull has turned out a book that couldnt be any<br/>
where near the truth in fact or legend.<br/>
<br/>
Considering the content of his previous book on the<br/>
ninja I would have to say I didnt think it was wirtten<br/>
by turnbull but by some high school kid that had<br/>
collected information from web sites created by other<br/>
high school kids.<br/>
<br/>
I say this speaking as a member of the bujinkan which<br/>
used to use the ninjutsu boom to promote itself.<br/>
<br/>
The book is a waste of paper and will only send people<br/>
in the worng direction if they are looking for<br/>
anything to do with ninja.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Paul,<br/>
We'll just have to agree to disagree. When Turnbull is speaking of historical ninja, what he writes is accurate (as borne out by many Japanese texts in my collection-although as noted in my last post, these events do not stand out as being anything other than regular samurai history in said texts. Japanese historical sources both primary and secondary are notoriously lacking in any reference to ninja as such, and in fact I would find any document that does somewhat Hayes-esque and suspect). When he is speaking of legends/myths etc, those are accurate. And when he is speaking of their role in popular culture, that is correct as well (the 'high school website' stuff-I'm unsure of what the 'pop culture' image of the ninja is in the UK, but he has nailed the USA pop culture version). The Iga Ninja museum (which Turnbull draws heavily upon) goes along with pretty much everything in the book (and is a great place to visit-along with the whacked out nearby ninja theme park).<br/>
I do agree (as indicated by my original post) that the earlier book is much better, in large part due to a greater focus on the historical ninja.<br/>
Best of luck with the dojo!</div>
