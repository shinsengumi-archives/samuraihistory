<br/>
In reference to the question of what other items does a Samurai Warrior carry with him onto the battlefield, other than his weapons? I have read in several books, The Five Rings & Others & I have heard from several of my Jpanese friends who have studied Japanese Samurai History and who have heard many Samurai family tales of Olden Times passed down from generation to generation, <br/>
That to be a Surviving Samaruai Warrior one had to be and Excellant Runner, one who would Run into the Battles and take several well placed whacks and or slashes , dispatching 3 or 4 departed Warriors, and would then run off from the fight just temporarily long enoug to wipe the Blood from his Blades, & perhaps check them for knicks and sharpness & if in need quickly sharpen them, he would then immediately run back to the Warring Action and again Enguage his Enemies, repeating the afore mentioned proceedure as often as necessary, until the Battle was Won! If this information is accurate and I believe that it is, A Samurai Warrior would also have to carry into battle a rag to wipe the blood from his blades and some type of sharpening stones and perhaps Clove Oil to lubricate and protect his Blades!<br/>

<br/>
I have researched your questions with "Su San Tatsue Koyama The World Famous Japanese/American Translator", who is also My Wife, and Su San advises That you are correct in calling the Samauri armour "Youri", and you are correct in the calling the kimono top, "hitatare", and you are correct in calling the pants "hakama".<br/>
<br/>
Su San also advised the following American/ Japanese Translations on your following questions of what equipment does a Samuai Warrior carry into battle.<br/>
<br/>
Helmet = Kabuto<br/>
<br/>
Armour = Yoroi<br/>
<br/>
Long Sword = Katana<br/>
<br/>
Short Sword = Wakizashi<br/>
<br/>
Knife = Tanto<br/>
<br/>
Shield = Tate<br/>
<br/>
Long Spear = Yari<br/>
<br/>
Short Spear = Ya<br/>
<br/>
Gloves = Tebu-Kuro<br/>
<br/>
Socks = Tabi<br/>
<br/>
Black Heavy Protective Over-Socks = Jika-Tabi<br/>
<br/>
Sandles = Zori<br/>
<br/>
Cloth = Nuno<br/>
<br/>
Oil of Cloves = Avuna-Klouv<br/>
<br/>
Sack or bag = Bukuro<br/>
<br/>
Horse = Uma<br/>

<h3>Re: [samuraihistory] clothes worn under armour</h3>
by <i>crazoftheages</i>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1988861821">Well, let's work in layers of clothing, shall we? <br/>
First we begin with the fundoshi, Japanese loincloth,<br/>
either the small thong kind or the long over body<br/>
kind.  Secondly there was the shitagi, which was<br/>
essentially a kimono, seccured by a belt called an obi<br/>
(that's the name most martial arts schools use for<br/>
their belts these days).  Since hakama, divided or<br/>
not, we usually so thick and bulky, next would usually<br/>
come the kobakama shorts, followed by tabbi socks and<br/>
finally the leggings known as kyahan.<br/>
<br/>
After this began the process of donning the bushi's<br/>
armor, unless you first count the footware of either<br/>
fur boots of the higher ups, or waraji sandles for the<br/>
lower ranks (commonly mistaken for the regular zori<br/>
sandles of civilians).<br/>
<br/>
Of course, some of these elements changed depending on<br/>
the time period or rank of the person.  A higher<br/>
officer might actually wear full hakama instead of<br/>
kobakama, and a very low ranking bushi might wear an<br/>
even shorter pair of trousers (think hot pants) called<br/>
matabiki.  The yoroi hitatare you mentioned was<br/>
commonly worn by higher officers over their fundoshi<br/>
instead of the more simple looking shitagi.<br/>
