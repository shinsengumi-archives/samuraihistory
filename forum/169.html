<div id="ygrps-yiv-1860208557">Hello all..<br/>
 My name is Ben Sharples and I am a student in London, England. I <br/>
have been fascinated by Samurai history since the age of 8 and have <br/>
built a collection of books and information on Japanese history, But <br/>
I have not as yet managed to visit Japan..<br/>
 My question is; I recently read that prior to the Kamakura era <br/>
(around 900-1000ad) the early Samurai clans fought wars against the <br/>
Ainu (presumably) and that a weapon used was a primitive design of <br/>
Crossbow.. Does anyone know why this method fell into disuse by the <br/>
time of the Gempei wars and was replaced by the Longbow?</div>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-543666905">Hi Ben,<br/>
<br/>
The oyumi (crossbow) you refer to was used extensively in the wars against<br/>
the Emishi but fell out of use because it required skilled technicians to<br/>
build, maintain & train the troops. Its decline was accelerated when the<br/>
government drop the Taiho military system (conscription) and privatised<br/>
military responsibilties to the various clans.<br/>
<br/>
Pacification of the Ainu (or Emishi) peoples occurred around 800's and was<br/>
complete by 811. The Emishi of Dewa & Mutsu revolted numerous times over<br/>
the next 100 years mainly due to famine or economic hardship. All this<br/>
occured in the middle Hein period  before samurai came of age. The use of<br/>
the oyumi is not recorded after 900 as far as I know.<br/>
