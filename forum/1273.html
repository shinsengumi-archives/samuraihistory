<div id="ygrps-yiv-2048503742">I don't know too much about it, but I got the impression from a <br/>
Japanese history teacher years ago that the whole 'Christian <br/>
connection' was a lot of propaganda, and an excuse to go after the <br/>
christians.  They apparently weren't really directly related, or the <br/>
issue was just food or taxes or something, and had nothing to do with <br/>
religeon.  Maybe someone on this list can go into better detail...<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1761158555">The daimyo in charge, Matsukura, was not only squeezing the population <br/>
for taxes,<br/>
he was also ferocious in his persecution of anyone suspected of being a <br/>
Christian.<br/>
The litany of tortures he practiced is stomach churning.<br/>
<br/>
The rebellion had a strong religious flavor to it because of a <br/>
charismatic Christian youth,<br/>
Amakusa Shiro, who became its de facto leader.   The rebels inflicted a <br/>
series<br/>
of ignominious defeats on the besieging samurai armies and so alarmed <br/>
the Shogunate that<br/>
help was requested from the Dutch, who obliged by attacking the rebels <br/>
from the sea<br/>
with naval cannon.<br/>
<br/>
Matsudaira Nobutsuna, the commander sent by the Shogunate to end<br/>
the uprising, opted for a lengthy siege, only concluding with a final <br/>
assault when<br/>
the rebels supplies had been exhausted and starvation had set in.<br/>
<br/>
There is a good description of the Shimabara rebellion in Ivan Morris' book<br/>
"The Nobility of Failure" in the chapter entitled, "Amakusa Shiro - <br/>
Japanese Messiah."<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1417733466">Hi Gabs<br/>
<br/>
As usual there is more to the "subject" than first meets the eye!! I have been undertaking some research on this topic and it may, one day, see the light of day in a book!! However in the meantime......<br/>
<br/>
There is an interesting chapter in Ivan Morris' Book " The Nobility of Failure" (ISBN 0-03-010811-X) Pub. 1975 which covers the "Japanese Messiah" and aspects covering the Shimabara Rebellion.  It is also briefly mentioned in Stephen Turnbull's "Samurai Sourcebook" under the Seige of Hara 1637-38 and several other of his works.<br/>
<br/>
There are also some interesting articles to be found on the "NET" if you search for "Amakusa Shiro" (the messiah), Shimabara or Hara.<br/>
<br/>
Good luck with the hunt, I am sure you will find it an interesting topic.... the last full, true samurai campaign.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1716258635">You might try Ivan Morris 'Nobility of Failure' has a chapter about Amakusa<br/>
Shirothe 'leader' of the rebellion. Also James Murdochs 2nd volume of his<br/>
history of Japan has a lot of detail but a dated perspective.</div>

 </span></blockquote>So the Dutch War of Independence, that lasted for 80 years b/w the Spain and the Low Countries, the latter aided and abetted by England, was being played out in Kyushu, where the Calvinist Protestants hurled shot after shot at the Shimabara rebels who were most likely papists under the influence of the Iberian Jesuits and Dominicans.  The shogunate played off the Protestants against the Catholics in this episode.<br/>
