for questions, so here I am.<br/>
<br/>
I am looking for information on Otani Yoshitsugu.<br/>
The site listed an update to the 'samurai of the week' section but <br/>
that section apparently does not have archived data.<br/>
Does anyone know where I can find the data and/or the source of its <br/>
information.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-693478145">None of the 'featured samurai' are archived, and we took down the <br/>
registry a while ago and totally reworked, added to, and cleaned it <br/>
up, but it is still a work on progress, so none of those bios are <br/>
available online.  There is a chance within the next 6 weeks that it <br/>
will get put together into a giant online database, but that is still <br/>
sort of up in the air.  For the moment, here is info on Otani <br/>
Yoshitsugu:<br/>
<br/>
Yoshitsugu's origins are unclear but one theory holds that <br/>
Yoshitsugu's family were former retainers of the Ôtomo family of <br/>
Bungo Province. He was recommended to Toyotomi Hideyoshi (possibly by <br/>
the young Ishida Mitsunari) around 1574 and quickly rose through the <br/>
ranks. He attacked Takigawa Kazumasu in the 1583 Shizugatake Campaign <br/>
and afterwards, follwing Hideyoshi's defeat of Shibata Katsuie, was <br/>
given Tsuruga in Echizen Province. He assisted in the logistical <br/>
aspects of Hideyoshi's 1587 invasion of Kyushu and was present for <br/>
the siege of Odawara Castle in 1590. He was later dispatched to the <br/>
northern provinces as a land survey officer, though his activities <br/>
during the 1590's are otherwise obscure, possibly due to a worsening <br/>
case of leprosy he was suffering from by this point. While in the <br/>
north he was forced to quell the resistance of Onodera Yasumichi in <br/>
1599, whose castle of Ômori Yoshitsugu besieged. In 1600 he at first <br/>
thought of joining Tokugawa Ieyasu's side in the coming war but was <br/>
convinced by Ishida Mitsunari to follow the latter instead. Though <br/>
suffering from now-advanced leprosy, he joined the 'western' forces <br/>
on the battlefield at Sekigahara and directed his troops from within <br/>
a palanquin. After the defection of Kobayakawa Hideaki to Tokugawa <br/>
Ieyasu's side, he ordered a retainer to cut off his head and spirit <br/>
it away. His daughter was married to Sanada Yukimura.<br/>
