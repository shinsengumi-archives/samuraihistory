<h3>Mitokomo</h3>
by <i>midorinotoradesu</i>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-2014076499">I have a question about a Japanese T.V. show.  I've been watching it <br/>
off and on for about a year now.  Mitokomo is probably the most <br/>
famous period drama on Japanese television.  It is very interesting <br/>
and I've made several observances.  It is obviously set in the Edo <br/>
Jidai.  They have had 3 or 4 different series of the show, marked by <br/>
different actors playing the important roles.  Mitokomo himself is <br/>
very important.  And his importance is what I am trying to figure <br/>
out.  They pull out his seal at the end of every show and say, "Kono <br/>
mon dokoro ga mei ne hairanuka?".  Translation something like: Can <br/>
your eyes not see this mark?  It is the Tokugawa Mon.  So is Mitokomo <br/>
one of the Tokugawa Shoguns or just a high level retainer? If he is <br/>
one of the Tokugawa Shoguns, which one is he?  <br/>

Mito Komon Mitsukuni or Tokugawa Mitsukuni (1628-1700) was Lord of Mito <br/>
and a son of one of the ancillary houses of the the Tokugawa Shogun. A <br/>
devoted scholar he dedicated himself to the study of Japanese history, <br/>
sponsored the writing of the Dai Nihon Shi, and "discovered" Kusunoki <br/>
Masashige making him a national hero. His Mito school of history <br/>
favored things Japanese over Chinese, Shinto over Buddhism and the <br/>
Emperor over the Shogun. The spread of this school of thought laid the <br/>
foundations for the national debate that arose when the Americans came <br/>
and showed the Bakufu to be lacking in leadership, and thus the Meiji <br/>
Restoration.<br/>
	He may have travelled in cognito ,"as a commoner", once or twice and <br/>
that fact has given rise to a series of books which then became a TV <br/>
show and there has been a movie as well I believe. The gimmick is that <br/>
no commoner could wear or carry the Tokugawa mon, so in the climactic <br/>
scenes he whips out his inro to the shock of all, who now see that he <br/>
is a Lord and not just some meddling old man...<br/>

means the "Yellow Gate of Mito" is that why the character is always <br/>

 </span></blockquote>Ah, "Mito Kômon."<br/>

My favorite jidai geki.<br/>

kokoroeru? Saki no fuku-shôgun, Mito Mitsukuni-kô ni arawaseru zo!"<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>As the rest of the line states, "saki no fuku-shôgun" -- the previous vice-shôgun.<br/>
<br/>
He is Mito Mitsuni (Tokugawa Mitsukuni), a grandson of Ieyasu, and head of the <br/>
powerful Mito branch of the Tokugawa. He was a scholar, a historian, and quite <br/>
the philosopher.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>"Kômon" is the (Japanese pronunciation of the) Chinese title which is the <br/>
equivalent of Mitsukuni's court rank -- "Dainagon" or "Great Counselor." The use <br/>
of Chinese titles was quite popular in early Tokugawa period, which was infused <br/>
with Confucian idealogy.<br/>
