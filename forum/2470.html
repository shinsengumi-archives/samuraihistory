<h3>Nagashino</h3>
by <i>cepooooo</i>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-539693740">Sure, guns were used since the 1550s, but it was at Nagashino,  that <br/>
for the first time the "volley firing" was used. By having shooters <br/>
rotating behind a palisade, Nobunaga used for the first time firearms <br/>
in an effective way. The rotation of shooters meant no gap between one <br/>
bullet and the next, and the palisade defended them from the charging <br/>
opponent. No army fighting with medieval weapons and tactics could have <br/>
ever won against that, in fact in Nagashino some 10,000 of the Takeda's <br/>
men died, two third of the entire army.<br/>
Regarding firearms, the Japanese started to make their own in the <br/>
1550s, copying from the Portuguese models. One of the main foundries <br/>
was in Sakai (today South Osaka), and that's why Nobunaga really wanted <br/>
to take that town - which, of course, he did.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1986687381">I agree with Nate.<br/>
In particular, the term Renaissance is normally used in a cultural <br/>

If we should select a historical period in medieval Japan we could <br/>
"compare" (oowwww, here we go again??) with the Renaissance, it would <br/>
probably be the very late Muromachi+Azuchi-Momoyama period of "Gold and <br/>
Red," coming after the austere, heavily Zen influenced arts of the <br/>
Kamakura/Muromachi periods. Nobunaga and Hideyoshi castles were perfect <br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Completely not true. A common fallacy. Rotating volley<br/>
fire was used by Nobunaga as early as 1554:<br/>
<br/>
"The following year, 1554, Nobunaga demonstrated that<br/>
he also knew how to use these new weapons when he<br/>
attacked Imagawa Yoshimoto's Muraki Castle on the Chit<br/>
Peninsula. Nobunaga advanced to the edge of the moat,<br/>
and organised relays of ashigaru with arquebuses to<br/>
keep up a constant fire. This was a clear example of<br/>
organised volley firing 25 years before Nagashino" <br/>
Turnbull, "The Samurai Sourcebook", p 135. <br/>
<br/>
The Ikko-ikki used it against him MANY times, notable<br/>
the second siege of Nagashima. Nobunaga's brilliance<br/>
at Nagashino was combining the use of this tactic and<br/>
the terrain and obstacles to form a defense designed<br/>
specifically for his opponent's greatest strength, his<br/>
cavalry. <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-292179867">Not a problem. It gets talked about often like it was<br/>
a breakthrough in military tactics--and I think it<br/>
was. But not because of the rotating firing<br/>
lines--that had been done before. <br/>
<br/>
To me, Nagashino confirms Nobunaga's military genius.<br/>
Not because he used rotating firing lines, but because<br/>
he analyzed his enemy and came up with a perfect plan<br/>
to defeat him. The way he combined the natural<br/>
terrain, the obstacles, and the fires is exactly like<br/>
they teach us as military officers. Unfortunately,<br/>
Takeda Katsuyori didn't listen to his officers, like<br/>
modern S-2's, who would have told him no way they<br/>
should go in there. Oh well. <br/>

<br/>
Wargaming, in a fashion, is an integral part of my<br/>
job. I've got no disrespect at all for someone else<br/>
who does it for fun. <br/>
<br/>
The point of my post is that in studying Japanese<br/>
history, you do not use the term "renaissance" to<br/>
describe any particular period of JAPANESE history.<br/>
The "Renaissance" was a Western European phenomenon,<br/>
by no means a world-wide event, and the use of it in<br/>
connection with Japanese history smacks of cultural<br/>
bias. Japan didn't HAVE a "Renaissance", at least not<br/>
in the same sense Europe did, so you can hopefully see<br/>
my confusion as to the use of the word. <br/>
<br/>
When you mentioned you used it because it's a term<br/>
used to describe that period in your wargaming, I<br/>
dismissed the question. I certainly didn't mean to<br/>
dismiss you--you answered my question for me. You were<br/>
using the term in a familiar application to you--and<br/>
now I understand that. If you had argued that it was a<br/>
valid HISTORICAL period of Japan, I would have still<br/>
been confused--would you mean the Azuchi-Momoyama<br/>
period, because there was a flourishing of the arts?<br/>
or would you mean the early Tokugawa, because of the<br/>
watershed political changes? Very confusing. <br/>
<br/>
Again, nothing meant against wargaming--I was thinking<br/>
in terms of a historical definition of the word. You<br/>
merely were using it in a context unfamiliar to me,<br/>
and I thank you for clearing it up. <br/>

  Thank you for clarifying your comments. I appreciate it.  I'm sorry if I was too quick to take offense.  I suspect that there are "serious historians" out there who look down on wargaming.  Of course, I would argue that wargaming has done more to teach history to the masses that all the serious historians put together (or at least most of them).  :)<br/>
<br/>
  You are correct, I was using the term "Renaissance" to identify a particular period of time and not to identify a particular period in Japanese history.  Or, at the most, a particular time in Japanese warfare involving the use of artillery and firearms.<br/>
<br/>
  If you don't mind sharing, I would be interested in hearing more about your job.  How does one make a living involving wargames?<br/>
<br/>
  Thanks again.<br/>

<h3>500,000 Deer Skins from Siam</h3>
by <i>cepooooo</i>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1175125537">Hi there. I am writing a paper on the "Junk-trade" commerce between <br/>
Ayutthaya (Siam) and Nagasaki in the first half of the 17th c. <br/>
According to a Dutch source, the Siamese sent to Tokugawa Japan 500,000 <br/>
deer skins in 1608.<br/>
Anybody has any idea why the Japanese would need so many deer skins-and <br/>
why Siamese?? Maybe they were cheaper? Better? If you have any kind of <br/>
source, even better, but reasonable guesses are ok too ;o)<br/>
THANK YOU!!<br/>

<h3>Re: Renaissance (was; Re: [samuraihistory] Kawanakajima-----historically modern?)</h3>
by <i>goodfella26426</i>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1847804511">"The point of my post is that in studying Japanese<br/>
history, you do not use the term "renaissance" to<br/>
describe any particular period of JAPANESE history.<br/>
The "Renaissance" was a Western European phenomenon,<br/>
by no means a world-wide event, and the use of it in<br/>
connection with Japanese history smacks of cultural<br/>
bias. Japan didn't HAVE a "Renaissance", at least not<br/>
in the same sense Europe did, so you can hopefully see<br/>
my confusion as to the use of the word. "<br/>
<br/>
Especially demonstrated in the case of Italy. THe italians wenth thru their renaissnce while England, France, Germany, etc.. were all still in the medieval age.. most deffinitely a cultural thing..<br/>
<br/>

Not at all, and I apologize if that's how it came out.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Wargaming, in a fashion, is an integral part of my<br/>
job. I've got no disrespect at all for someone else<br/>
who does it for fun. <br/>
<br/>
The point of my post is that in studying Japanese<br/>
history, you do not use the term "renaissance" to<br/>
describe any particular period of JAPANESE history.<br/>
The "Renaissance" was a Western European phenomenon,<br/>
by no means a world-wide event, and the use of it in<br/>
connection with Japanese history smacks of cultural<br/>
bias. Japan didn't HAVE a "Renaissance", at least not<br/>
in the same sense Europe did, so you can hopefully see<br/>
my confusion as to the use of the word. <br/>
<br/>
When you mentioned you used it because it's a term<br/>
used to describe that period in your wargaming, I<br/>
dismissed the question. I certainly didn't mean to<br/>
dismiss you--you answered my question for me. You were<br/>
using the term in a familiar application to you--and<br/>
now I understand that. If you had argued that it was a<br/>
valid HISTORICAL period of Japan, I would have still<br/>
been confused--would you mean the Azuchi-Momoyama<br/>
period, because there was a flourishing of the arts?<br/>
or would you mean the early Tokugawa, because of the<br/>
watershed political changes? Very confusing. <br/>
<br/>
Again, nothing meant against wargaming--I was thinking<br/>
in terms of a historical definition of the word. You<br/>
merely were using it in a context unfamiliar to me,<br/>
and I thank you for clearing it up. <br/>
