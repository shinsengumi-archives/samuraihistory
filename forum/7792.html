<div id="ygrps-yiv-1287111091">I realize that this is a history list and not a film criticism/discussion<br/>
list. However, I do think that historical novels or films can sometimes give<br/>
us a few insights into studying actual history, especially when source<br/>
documents or accounts that are contemporary to the time being studied are<br/>
not always available. So I'm going to go ahead and discuss some films here.<br/>
I'll try and relate the discussion of films to the study of history. <br/>
<br/>
Discussing AFTER THE RAIN: Just my opinion, but I try to be careful when<br/>
using terms such as "western". What does that really mean? That Kurosawa was<br/>
influenced by non-Japanese (American or European) writings or films? Or that<br/>
he incorporated some of these concepts and ideas into his own script for<br/>
AFTER THE RAIN and/or his other films?  Many American or European novelists<br/>
and film makers have adopted Japanese ideas and concepts into their works.<br/>
So does that make them "eastern?" What constitutes "western" and "eastern?"<br/>
How meaningful are these concepts, really? <br/>
<br/>
Also which Japanese criticized Kurosawa and what were their specific<br/>
criticisms? <br/>
<br/>
I'm not one who espouses "identity politics," which I understand to be a<br/>
strain of academic thought that people should only write or create or<br/>
interpret from their own cultural experiences and not stray into the<br/>
experiences of cultures not their own.  I don't follow this, as in some<br/>
ways, we all belong to the culture known as "human beings." We don't exist<br/>
in a vacuum; so anyone, whether Japanese, European, American, African,<br/>
whatever, will be influenced to a greater or lesser extent by other cultures<br/>
and not just by the culture that we may have grown up in.  <br/>
<br/>
Now for the issue as to whether a person such as the main character in AFTER<br/>
THE RAIN can be a "good" samurai: Are you trying to say that this would be a<br/>
"western" idea, that a man like this might be an admirable samurai? <br/>
<br/>
You are correct in that within the Edo period, a bushi who makes his living<br/>
by swordfighting for money was not considered to be very honorable at all.<br/>
Because the ethic was that a samurai was supposed to use his sword skills in<br/>
service to his lord and not for monetary gain. That was the ethic of the<br/>
day. <br/>
<br/>
But then why study history? Do we simply say, "this swordsman was<br/>
dishonorable because that's what was thought by the majority in the time<br/>
that he lived" and leave it at that? Don't we sometimes study history to<br/>
study these codes of ethics -- and sometimes to question them? Or is this<br/>
"western?" I don't think so.  <br/>
<br/>
We've discussed Kobayashi Masaki's film SEPPUKU here earlier. In this film,<br/>
a ronin shows up at the gate of a daimyo's Edo headquarters, stating that he<br/>
wishes a spot to commit seppuku so as to no longer have to live in dire<br/>
poverty. It turns out that this ronin didn't even have real swords, but had<br/>
pawned them and substituted bamboo blades for his real ones; he had sold his<br/>
"soul of the samurai" for money. So how could he commit seppuku? It turns<br/>
out further that seppuku wasn't his real motive, he really wanted to beg for<br/>
money. How more dishonorable than that can a samurai be? This was the ethic<br/>
of the day, and in the film, the clan involved, the Ii clan, decide to give<br/>
out a stern message by forcing the man to commit seppuku with his bamboo<br/>
blade. According to the standards of that society, that was a just and<br/>
appropriate response to this man's shameless beggary and extortion.<br/>
<br/>
But then Kobayashi turns the whole event upside down by revealing that<br/>
perhaps this man had very few alternatives to what he had chosen to do. His<br/>
family was sick and starving and he had no way to support them, even though<br/>
he had tried. Would it have been more honorable to let his family starve and<br/>
die rather than attempt to get money to try and save them?  Was the clan's<br/>
reaction honorable and just? Or cruel and sadistic? All these questions get<br/>
raised in the film. Though the events he portrays are set in the 17th<br/>
century in Japan, these questions that are raised apply all over the world,<br/>
throughout different ages -- that could have been one of the motives for<br/>
Kobayashi to make this historical film. Did this make Kobayashi "western?" I<br/>
don't think so.   <br/>
<br/>
On another subject: how does the study of historical films and novels relate<br/>
to the study of actual history? Most fiction is speculative and there are<br/>
those who find it worthless because it is fiction and not an attempt to<br/>
study what is "real." But some of us do turn to fiction because other<br/>
sources aren't available. I find it interesting: did Kobayashi turn to a<br/>
ferile imagination when he made the film about samurai begging for funds<br/>
while claiming to want to commit seppuku? Or is it possible that this sort<br/>
of thing actually happened? Is the bamboo-blade seppuku a product of a wild<br/>
imagination, or is it possible that something like this may also have<br/>
happened but the historical accounts are lost? That is the nature of<br/>
speculative fiction. It might have a place in studying history or perhaps it<br/>
doesn't.<br/>
<br/>

NinaThe screen writer of the film (Akira Kurosawa),<br/>
while one of the great film makers in the world, was often criticized in<br/>
Japan for being too western and had trouble getting some of his films made<br/>
without western backing.  The idea of an accountant that uses a ploy to<br/>
trick kenjutsu masters into feeding him (effectively begging) then when he<br/>
finally can fence, fencing for money is all despicable in the eyes of<br/>
samurai (as they made clear at the end of the film). <br/>
The samurai (masterfully portrayed by Mifune Shiro) was an amazing swordsman<br/>
and a very nice man, but by "period" samurai standards, not a worthy<br/>
samurai. <br/>
This is not a story about a great samurai, it is at its heart a love story<br/>
and the relationship between a man and his wife and how she grows to respect<br/>
him and love him not for who she wants him to become but for who he is.<br/>
