DVD Review<br/>
Harakiri (Seppuku), director Masaki Kobayashi's powerful indictment <br/>
of social structures, in this case the Tokugawa shogunate, which <br/>
demolish the individual's dignity in favor of authoritarian rule, is <br/>
a superb film. Set in 1630 near the beginning of the famous <br/>
shogunate's rule, Harakiri (Seppuku) exposes Tom Cruise's vain <br/>
attempt at multiculturalism, The Last Samurai, for what it isÂ—a <br/>
mindless narrative based on inane American notions of the samurai. <br/>
Kobayashi's film is a subtle, astute tale full of outrage and <br/>
profundity.<br/>
<br/>
As the film opens, momentous change is sweeping across Japan, <br/>
causing many samurai to fall into exile as ronin, masterless <br/>
samurai. Despite the changes, the Iyi Clan is prosperous and adheres <br/>
strictly to their oaths. Thus, when a man claiming to be a retainer <br/>
of the fallen Fukushima Clan arrives, they question his motives. <br/>
Hanshiro Tsugumo (Tatsuya Nakadai) asks permission to commit <br/>
harakiri, ritual suicide, in the Iyi Clan's forecourt. The <br/>
counselor, Kageyu Saito (Rentaro Mikuni), is skeptical because many <br/>
ronin have been attempting to extort money from various clans by <br/>
playing to their sympathies under the guise of this sacred ritual. <br/>
Saito meets with Tsugumo in private, speaking frankly in the ascetic <br/>
environment, telling the story of a young man, Motome Chijiiwa <br/>
(Akira Ishihama), who made the same proposition. Through a series of <br/>
vivid flashbacks, Chijiiwa's fate at the austere hands of the Iyi <br/>
Clan is revealed. Exposed as a scoundrel, they force him to commit <br/>
harakiri with his bamboo sword.<br/>
<br/>
The story does not phase Tsugumo, however, who confidently informs <br/>
Saito that he has every intention of slicing his own abdomen. The <br/>
ceremony is prepared, but Tsugumo makes a request for the great Iyi <br/>
swordsmen Hikokuro Omodaka (Tetsuro Tamba) to assist in the ritual. <br/>
Omodaka is absent due to illness, so Tsugumo makes two additional <br/>
requests for samurai who are also absent. Each of the three <br/>
requested men was intricately involved in Chijiiwa's excruciating <br/>
death, prompting Saito to suspect Tsugumo of a conspiracy. As they <br/>
wait for news on the three missing samurai, Tsugumo tells the story <br/>
of his life and reveals his relationship to Chijiiwa. There is no <br/>
telling how things will play out, but Saito and Tsugumo find <br/>
themselves locked in a battle of wills that could very soon turn <br/>
into a deadly duel.<br/>
<br/>
Kobayashi's direction is patient in its storytelling. Working from a <br/>
script by Shinobu Hashimoto (most famous for Rashomon), Kobayashi <br/>
shifts focus between the Iyi courtyard and Tsugumo's story with <br/>
great skill, allowing the flashbacks to slowly reveal all the events <br/>
that led up to Tsugumo's arrival. Watching the events unfold, I <br/>
found myself mesmerized by how little actually happens. In many <br/>
ways, Harakiri is the antithesis to Kurosawa's brilliant samurai <br/>
pictures. Apart from the violent and unbridled demise of Chijiiwa <br/>
(shown in unblinking horror, with canted camera angles heightening <br/>
the effect) the movie is mostly calm and little more than two men <br/>
conversing in front of a large audience. Yet, there's a kind of <br/>
spectacle in all of this. The richly adventurous black-and-white <br/>
cinematography by Yoshio Miyajima merges both serenity and chaos, <br/>
capturing the alluring production design with tremendous realism. <br/>
Furthering that sense is the musical score, bringing emotion and <br/>
drama into perfect harmony. The filmmaking is so good that I <br/>
genuinely felt like I was sitting in feudal Japan while watching it.<br/>
<br/>
There are flaws, however, in the storytelling. At 133 minutes, <br/>
Kobayashi could employ some judicious editing to strengthen the <br/>
film's effect. There are moments when the courtyard scenes lag, <br/>
taking the audience out of Tsugumo's drama. However, the extended <br/>
length is made durable by Tatsuya Nakadai's incredible performance <br/>
as Tsugumo. Only 30 years old when making the film, Nakadai embodies <br/>
his character with zeal and intelligence. The ragged beard and <br/>
tethered clothes further his performance, which contains a range <br/>
unusual in Japanese films of the period. The dialogue is poetic, <br/>
employing a kabuki aesthetic and mixing it with method acting. Pay <br/>
special attention to the early scenes when Nakadai is listening to <br/>
his fellow actor, Rentaro Mikuni. The two create a tension that <br/>
seeps off of the screen and into the viewer.<br/>
<br/>
Harakiri is a classic piece of cinema. The themes of the film, which <br/>
are antiauthoritarian, are timeless and raise many questions. What <br/>
is honor? Who decides whether an act is honorable? What is the price <br/>
of humanity? Kobayashi weaves these questions into a stunning story <br/>
that can only be appreciated by viewing it.<br/>
