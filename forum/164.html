<h3>A question and a introduction.</h3>
by <i>Aaron</i>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-4983684">Hi<br/>
<br/>
  My name is Aaron and I have had an interest in samurai history <br/>
since a boy. It started with manga's like Lone wolf and cub and <br/>
movies like Yojimbo, Ran etc. But as I grew older my interest in the <br/>
history grew.<br/>
   I am definitly an amature historian and not a scholar by any sense <br/>
of the word. But I hope to contribute to the list as time goes on.<br/>
<br/>
   My question is, were peasants literate during the samurai eras or <br/>
was it only the samurai or noble classes.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Regards<br/>
Aaron</div>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-613308070">As far as I have read most people including many lower samurai were<br/>
illiterate or semiliterate up until the Edo period. From that time on<br/>
literacy spread until by the 18th century Japan was perhaps the most<br/>
literate country at that time.<br/>
