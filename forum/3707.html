 </span></blockquote>       Okay, just a question here: which would have been better: for them to<br/>
have used deception and get in to attempt the spread of their message or<br/>
tell<br/>
the truth, probably get killed and never get a word in about their message?<br/>
--------------------------<br/>
Well, this is what (not you, but Xavier) I call hipocrisy.<br/>
Christian scriptures say in a very clear way that if the word of the (greek)<br/>
evangelion, is not wanted, the missionary should shake his sandals, to take<br/>
all the dust from the land or house, and go elsewhere to never coming back.<br/>
Buddhism, Taoism and Confucionism never needed to spread lies to be present<br/>
in Japan, and was even subject of study in high schools specially in Samurai<br/>
Families.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
To me, missionary work can take on many disguises, because it's a matter of<br/>
using whatever means you have to to get your message out and if you believe<br/>
it's<br/>
that important, you die for it.  As someone said, it's a matter of WHICH<br/>
(L)ord you're dying for.  In their cases, they were dying for a Lord Not Of<br/>
This<br/>
World.  They adhered absolutely to the tenets of bushido in that they served<br/>
their highest Lord to the death.<br/>
------------------<br/>
Well, had ya forgot that they had a previous Lord to whom they was already<br/>
in oath of Loyalty? It is called threason anyway. So, in this way, it is not<br/>
bushido.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Show me one samurai who never lied or used<br/>
falsehood or murdered or committed some form of treason to protect his<br/>
lord --<br/>
human or Otherwise -- and I'll show you a liar.  :-)<br/>
-----------------<br/>
Well, I admit that I must study more about the life of individual samurais<br/>
in general than great batles and events in Japan History, however I know<br/>
about The Saint of the Sword (The Kensei), and never heard about him needing<br/>
to break oathes and telling lies to accomplish his missions. (read Go Rin No<br/>
Shou)<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
       As for Nobunaga, what about the threat of the Ikko Ikki?  Do you<br/>
think<br/>
they wanted to party hearty?  Do you think they were going to try and<br/>
proselytize him and his army?  Hardly likely.  It is unlikely that a<br/>
majority of the<br/>
people who stood in Nobunaga's way, even if they did congeal into a potent<br/>
fighting force, would have stood a chance against a brilliant general such<br/>
as the<br/>
leader of the Oda and his right hand man, Toyotomi, this is true.  But that<br/>
wasn't the issue.  The issue was that anyone who stood in Oda's way of<br/>
unifying<br/>
Japan -- in WHATEVER WAY THAT WAS -- was seen as a threat.  Any threat -- no<br/>
matter how great or small, or how justified or unjustified -- must be<br/>
removed.<br/>
 Therefore, the genocide, however indefencible to us, was very defencible to<br/>
HIM, and quite frankly, that's the only opinion about the issue that really<br/>
mattered in the end, although it is nice to bat it around and say "what if"<br/>
and<br/>
"what was he thinking?" now with four hundred years plus of hindsight.<br/>
       And I must throw my hat into the ring about it too -- I may not be a<br/>
Catholic (either belief or by church membership), but these anti-Catholic<br/>
posts<br/>
have GOT to stop.<br/>
       Anyway, that's my two "not-worth-much" cents.  8-)  Take care, y'all.<br/>

"All gifts demand a compensation"<br/>
(Old Viking Saying)<br/>
<br/>
It is just to go back to the topic and not preaching or embelezling<br/>
christianity history related to Samurai.<br/>
<br/>
About Nobunaga, ya forgot the point that he did all that massacre under the<br/>
political and finantial support of the Jesus Company (Jesuites), and yes,<br/>
poor villagers was killed for just dwelling near the temples. And concerning<br/>
the temples weaponry, since the beggining, certain forms of buddhism,<br/>
specially Dhyana, has contained Martial Arts under their spiritual<br/>
practices, not only to their own safety, but as a trainning to achieve<br/>
enlightenment. (it was presented in the Pure Land monasteries in Japan,<br/>
because in China, the Pure Land Teachings and Dhyana Teachings was taunt<br/>
together from the same patriarch, Bodhidharma who also had a linneage from<br/>
Nagarjuna too.).<br/>
References:<br/>
The Bodhisattva Warriors<br/>
Terence Dukes<br/>
Wisdom Publishing<br/>
(it is in english)<br/>
<br/>
Although (under my knowledge), Martial Arts are not present in Tibetan<br/>
Vajrayana, there is several references in their sutras, shastras and<br/>
treatises using weapon iconography both representing Demonic Forces working<br/>
against karma, sentient beings, etc or in hand of a Wrathful deities to cut<br/>
negativities, such as the three poisons of the mind.<br/>
<br/>
So, they had weapons, and what? They was not a big fan of Nobunaga's abuses,<br/>
and so what? Does they attempted to take over control of Japan, went to<br/>
Nobunaga's house to kill him, to justificate such actions?<br/>
<br/>
Concerning you throwing your hat about that, it displeases me that people do<br/>
so much to act in defense of a institution that gave so much support to such<br/>
atrocities, including Germany's Nazism, but no one said anything about a<br/>
serious demonstration of RACISM and discrimination against my country<br/>
(Brazil), in a message that was totally OFF TOPIC, and of course, a SERIOUS<br/>
VIOLATION not only against Yahoogroups TOS (Therms of Service) but against<br/>
even some international laws. I sent my protests to the list owner and he<br/>
asked me for more tolerance to ensure peace. And All what I did was to say<br/>
that I was very happy that in this recent fiction movie inside an period of<br/>
Japan History, that they did a positive reference instead of the usual<br/>
racist discrimination USA Movies did against asiatic in the past presenting<br/>
asiatics as monkeys and simmilar extremisms. Like those that made the<br/>
fammous Mr. Bruce Lee so upset in his life. (and in this way I was happy<br/>
that The Last Samurai did that, even if not 100% historically accurated) So,<br/>
I even respectfully ask you to, before take the role of "most holy than<br/>
thou", to think about this issues.<br/>
<br/>
My country is not perfect, and I know that, however racism here is crime<br/>
punishable with jail and I am very proud of that.<br/>
