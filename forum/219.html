"Of all that is written I love only what a man has written<br/>
with his blood.  Write with the blood, and you will<br/>
experience that blood is spirit."---Friedrich Nietzsche<br/>
<br/>
"ATTENTION: KEEP YOUR EYE ON THE DETAILS."---Unknown<br/>
<br/>
"It is spiritless to think that you cannot attain to that which<br/>
you have seen and heard the masters attain.  The masters are men.<br/>
You are also a man.  If you think that you will be inferior in doing<br/>
something, you will be on that road very soon."---Yamamoto Tsunetomo</div>
