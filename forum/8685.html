<br/>
If you want to assert Berne Convention copyright, then maybe you should <br/>
be attaching a Berne Convention copyright notice. These notices <br/>
typically contain the copyright symbol, the year, and the name of the <br/>
owner.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Are you referring to the message attached to the bottom of my post? If<br/>
so, that's automatically attached by my employer whenever I send an<br/>
external e-mail using this account, so there is not much I can do about<br/>
it. <br/>
