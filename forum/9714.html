<div id="ygrps-yiv-766381415">I am trying to find the sign's of the Samurai. I think that there are <br/>
42 sign's in all. These are drawing's, that represent the symbol's of <br/>
the Samurai. Some look like mushroom cap's, with other line's drawn <br/>
around them. Sort of like the modern Day bio hazard symbol. Can anyone <br/>
direct Me to a link, where I can find these? Thanks. Tom.</div>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1065951434">Try looking up "kamon" in your prefferred search engine. You're thinking of kamon, which are family crests. Each samurai family had their own, much like a European knight had a coat of arms. There are major differences, but those with more knowledge than I can sort that out. Or, you can do some research, which is the preferred option. <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-2036842333">Hi!<br/>
I'm a designer and one day I found this website with lots of kamons. I don't <br/>
know how accurate they are but there is a lot in there and they are all <br/>
hi-res if you need to download.<br/>
Hope it helps: <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://eps.crest-japan.net/index_en.php">http://eps.crest-japan.net/index_en.php</a><br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-949268139">Yes Kamon will be you best bet. I ask my host mother awhile back about  <br/>
the same thing and she showed me to a good website. But it was all in  <br/>
Japanese but the pictures was very detailed. If I find it I will try  <br/>
to email you.<br/>
<br/>
One way to find it is go to yahoo.cm.jp I think and type kamon in  <br/>
Japanese. Doing that will surely help too.<br/>
