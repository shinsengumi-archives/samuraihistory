Japanese filmmaker Takeshi Kitano remakes popular series, <br/>
successfully adds his own spin<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
Stone-faced Japanese filmmaker Takeshi Kitano blurs the line between <br/>
insanity and genius with The Blind Swordsman: Zatoichi, his sublimely <br/>
syncopated re-imagining of the popular samurai movie series from the <br/>
1960s, '70s and '80s.<br/>
<br/>
With blond-dyed hair, ``Beat'' Takeshi, as the director likes to call <br/>
himself when acting, puts a new spin on the rumpled avenger the late <br/>
Shintaro Katsu, embodied through 26 features and tons of TV episodes. <br/>
He's quieter and chuckles like a fool a lot, but Takeshi's wandering, <br/>
gambling masseur is still swiftly and precisely deadly with a cane-<br/>
sheathed sword.<br/>
<br/>
But that mayhem (and there is lots of it, choreographed with brutal <br/>
impact and lots of computer-generated blood) is just the core of an <br/>
astute design scheme that lifts B-movie entertainment to a level of <br/>
kamikaze art.<br/>
<br/>
At various stages throughout the film, you'll notice background <br/>
activities or connecting scenes -- 19th-century peasants working a <br/>
field, say, or inspired nonsense with barrels -- taking on a <br/>
distinctive rhythmic quality that could, perhaps, reflect Zatoichi's <br/>
heightened hearing. When this joyously culminates with a bizarre <br/>
climactic tap-dancing routine, you know things have gone where no <br/>
samurai has dared go before. If this doesn't completely throw you out <br/>
of the film, you'll be absolutely delighted.<br/>
<br/>
The story, which is loosely based on the first Zatoichi movie, <br/>
follows the traditional-enough lines of our hero entering a town <br/>
caught up in a gang war. There's also a masterless ronin, Gennosuke <br/>
Hattori (the imposing Tadanobu Asano), whom we know Zatoichi will <br/>
eventually face down.<br/>
<br/>
But that's as standard as matters are allowed to get. Two geisha with <br/>
murder on their minds (and one big secret between them), a crusty old <br/>
woman and her wastrel nephew whose sexuality comes into sudden <br/>
question are just some of the oddballs Zatoichi has to cope with.<br/>
<br/>
As he's done in some of his gangster movies (Sonatine) and <br/>
sentimental kid comedies (Kikujiro), Takeshi juggles and juxtaposes <br/>
comedy with violence and burlesque with social commentary. But he's <br/>
never before mixed so many disparate elements as boldly, nor as <br/>
successfully, as he does in Zatoichi. It's a mad masterpiece.</div>
