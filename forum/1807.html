<div id="ygrps-yiv-1300619097">Some of the English and French clocks of the period have an insane <br/>
amount of dials that tracks tides, moonrise, sunset, etc. Clocks are one <br/>
of the few areas where Europe was far ahead of the East starting in the <br/>
12-1300's with the invention of the verge escapement. Part of the reason <br/>
for this of course is that other cultures didn't have to pray at exact <br/>
times like the Catholic church of the period insisted on. I do remember <br/>
seeing a book on the subject but if I recollect properly, clockmaking <br/>
doesn't get started until the Jesuits show up.<br/>
<br/>
Still cool for later period stuff.<br/>
<br/>
Some stuff off a website:<br/>
<br/>
We have a number of such books on general or specific technologies <br/>
published during the period, as never existed in the preceding era. <br/>
Progress in printing and the demand for information from industrialists <br/>
stimulated their publication. Number, variety and contents of these <br/>
books far more superseded those written in the contemporary China, and <br/>
we may compare them with the Renaissance and Baroque technical books of <br/>
Europe. Most of them are reprinted with commentary and notes by modern <br/>
editors.<br/>
<br/>
We can classify these books in several categories: first, compendium or <br/>
encyclopedia; second, picture book; third, practical text; and fourth, <br/>
memorandum of practioner. Karakuri-kimmo-kagamigusa (automaton) 1730; <br/>
Karakuri-zui (clock & automaton) 1796; <snip snip snip><br/>
<br/>
In addition to these books local historians are searching for materials <br/>
of related subjects in unpublished letters or reports.<br/>
<br/>
More:<br/>
<br/>
The first mechanical clocks introduced to Japan were probably Italian <br/>
and Dutch clocks presented as gifts by European merchants in the early <br/>
to mid sixteenth century. Between 1550 and 1650 there was a strong <br/>
missionary influence in Japan, particularly the Jesuits, who taught <br/>
clock making. In 1650 all Europeans were ejected from Japan with the <br/>
exception of a small European enclave at Nagasaki. Early Japanese clocks <br/>
therefore used Western technology to keep the Chino/Japanese time system.<br/>
<br/>
This time system divides the day into two parts, each with six two hours <br/>
periods. The first is from sun up to sun down and the second from sun <br/>
down to sun up. The problem is obviously that with changing seasons the <br/>
dark hours and the light hours will be relatively longer or shorter. <br/>
This resulted in two kinds of clock, one with a variable running speed <br/>
and fixed markers or one with a constant running speed and movable markers.<br/>
<br/>
In 1853 Perry re-established a European presence in Japan and in 1873 <br/>
the Japanese revoked their traditional time keeping system and adopted <br/>
Western time keeping. Traditional Japanese clocks have therefore become <br/>
very collectible.<br/>
<br/>
More:!<br/>
When the Dutch factory chief Isaac Titsingh left Japan in 1784, he <br/>
decided to take home a local timepiece. He was furious with the <br/>
shogunate for its intransigence and stymieing of trade, and feigned <br/>
illness to be relieved on his post ahead of schedule. But the clocks of <br/>
Japan were something for which he had nothing but admiration. "I <br/>
examined a clock", he wrote on his return, "in the palace of the <br/>
governor of Nagasaki; and as the construction seemed curious, I was <br/>
desirous of bringing one with me from Japan." Yet trade being fettered <br/>
as it was, "the high price demanded for them deprived me of this <br/>
gratification" (Isaac Titsingh, /Illustrations of Japan/, 1822; p.159). <br/>
Fortunately later travellers were better heeled, and there are clock <br/>
collections in the West. But we have waited until now for a proper <br/>
exhibition of Japanese clocks in all their 'curiousness'. This wonderful <br/>
show (which goes far beyond just clocks) should not be missed.<br/>
<br/>
Many items used in Japanese time-keeping are not indigenous, and had <br/>
Titsingh looked closer, he might have seen workings not dissimilar to <br/>
European ones; very possibly the governor's clock included imported <br/>
parts. Steel springs could not be made in Japan, neither could small <br/>
cogwheels. In fact, clocks and pocket watches were extensively imported <br/>
to Japan, where the latter became known as "London clocks" <br/>
(/rondon-dokei/); it is often forgotten that England lost its <br/>
horological priority to Switzerland only in the 19th century. A samurai <br/>
and wit, Ota Nanpo, wrote of the situation in Edo at just the moment <br/>
Titsingh was in town. "No-one was without an imported European clock <br/>
slipped in at his breast" (Ota Nanpo, 'Ichiwa ichigon', in /Zoku nihon <br/>
zuihitsu taisei/, supplement, 1978, p.197).<br/>
<br/>
Time is told differently in different parts of the globe, and it was a <br/>
feature of Japanese time telling to assign six hours to daylight and six <br/>
to darkness. This meant that, other than at the equinoxes, a day-time <br/>
and a night-time hour were not the same, and that they fluctuated <br/>
against each other throughout the year. Full time 'masters of clocks' <br/>
(/tokeishi/) regulated the weights that hung from the gyrating spindles <br/>
to retard or quicken movement. Not for nothing went the comic verse,<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
However cunningly made,<br/>

Are just too many<br/>

Japan, Edo period (1615-1868)<br/>
<br/>
Time in Japan's cities was mostly measured by the booming of hour-bells <br/>
(/toki no kane/), either those erected for the purpose, or those <br/>
co-opted from local temples. The bell at the city entrance to Edo rang <br/>
an hour ahead to ensure those going to attend at the castle would never <br/>
be late. Edo's main hour-bell was in Kokuchô, which happened to be by <br/>
the Dutch East India Company's hostel. This spawned many jokes of a <br/>
culturally relative kind.<br/>
<br/>
This is fundamentally an art exhibition, and the technical pieces on <br/>
display are mostly given the backdrop of a painting or print <br/>
illustrating them in real spaces. /Ukiyo-e/ prints – the forte of <br/>
Timothy Clark who curated this show – are copiously used in evidence. <br/>
More than half of the gallery is given over to other instances of <br/>
time-telling, such as representations of the signs of the so-called <br/>
Chinese Zodiac (actually not a zodiac at all), with which most people <br/>
today are familiar. These signs (monkey, cock, tiger, etc.) were used in <br/>
fashion ornaments, such as /netsuke/ toggles, or were the subject of <br/>
full-blown paintings. A painting of a dragon, for example, would be <br/>
appropriate to put out in a Year of the Dragon (like 2000), and as the <br/>
signs came around every 12 years, it was worth the cost of buying such <br/>
things, each according to their budget. People might display the sign of <br/>
their birth, and the grave of the third Shogun, Iemitsu, is covered with <br/>
hares, as this was his natal sign.<br/>
<br/>
The cycle of the year has a place in the heart of anyone who has <br/>
received a Japanese education, and paintings of the four seasons, the <br/>
twelve months, or the festivals and events proper to these are all <br/>
common in Japanese visual arts. It is a feature of Japanese painting, <br/>
not seen elsewhere on the Asian continent, to depict a single landscape <br/>
across a complete year, usually with two seasons per screen across a <br/>
pair. Some good examples are on display in the Japan Time exhibition.<br/>
<br/>
Yet More!<br/>
<br/>
*/A very rare and unusual watch. The Japanese based their method of <br/>
timekeeping on a Chinese system which is somewhat eccentric, the length <br/>
of their periods of time altering throughout the year. Each 24 hour day <br/>
is divided into its two natural sections, day and night. These are then <br/>
divided into six equal parts. This necessitates allowing mechanical <br/>
timekeepers to have adjustable markings. Timepieces made for the <br/>
Japanese market are rare. This is the only example of a clockwatch we <br/>
have seen. The case itself is also somewhat odd, being large and deep. <br/>
It would have originally had a protective case or box made of leather or <br/>
perhaps wood. /*<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1513620304">HI James and others<br/>
<br/>
thanks some really nice info on time keeping in Japan<br/>
during and after the Edo period, but what about before<br/>
then<br/>
<br/>
Surely they didnt wait for the cock to crow. There<br/>
must have been some method of time keeping so that<br/>
occassions and events could start at a set time.<br/>
<br/>
I have a friend in Japan who is interested in history<br/>
I willask him also and post here if he has anything to<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1517530816">Hey there.  Me again.<br/>
  Maybe I can be of some help.  (Maybe not, time will tell.  8-)!)  Some time <br/>
ago now, I got a copy of the Tale of the Heike.  (Didn't finish it: got too <br/>
bogged down with titles and the complicatedness of the story itself.  But I do <br/>
plan to read -- and finish -- it someday.  That, the Tale of the Genji and the <br/>
Taiheiki.)  In it was a chart listing the times of the day, and they were in <br/>
twelve two-hour blocks, each named with a corresponding part of the Chinese <br/>
Zodiac, and went in order of that system (i.e., hour of the dragon, hour of the <br/>
snake, &c.).  Which one started the cycle I don't remember, but it was on the <br/>
odd hours.  If I'm not mistaken, it went as follows:<br/>
<br/>
WESTERN         JAPANESE<br/>
2300 to 0100           Rat<br/>
0100 to 0300           Ox<br/>
0300 to 0500           Tiger<br/>
0500 to 0700           Rabbit<br/>
0700 to 0900        Dragon<br/>
0900 to 1100           Snake<br/>
1100 to 1300           Horse<br/>
1300 to 1500           Goat<br/>
1500 to 1700           Monkey<br/>
1700 to 1900           Rooster<br/>
1900 to 2100           Dog<br/>
2100 to 2300           Pig<br/>
<br/>
  Now whether this was ACTUALLY used or not, and whether or not I've got my <br/>
times right, I'm not sure.  I don't want to question the historicity of the <br/>
Tale of the Heike, but it is a novel, if memory serves me correctly.<br/>
  Hope this helps.  8-)<br/>

Zodiac, and went in order of that system (i.e., hour<br/>
of the dragon, hour of the <br/>
snake, &c.).  Which one started the cycle I don't<br/>
remember, but it was on the <br/>
odd hours.  If I'm not mistaken, it went as follows:<br/>
<br/>
WESTERN         JAPANESE<br/>
2300 to 0100           Rat<br/>
0100 to 0300           Ox<br/>
0300 to 0500           Tiger<br/>
0500 to 0700           Rabbit<br/>
0700 to 0900        Dragon<br/>
0900 to 1100           Snake<br/>
1100 to 1300           Horse<br/>
1300 to 1500           Goat<br/>
1500 to 1700           Monkey<br/>
1700 to 1900           Rooster<br/>
1900 to 2100           Dog<br/>
2100 to 2300           Pig<br/>
<br/>
  Now whether this was ACTUALLY used or not, and<br/>
whether or not I've got my <br/>
times right, I'm not sure.  I don't want to question<br/>
the historicity of the <br/>
Tale of the Heike, but it is a novel, if memory serves<br/>
me correctly.<br/>
  Hope this helps.  8-)<br/>
