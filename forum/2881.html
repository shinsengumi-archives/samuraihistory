 </span></blockquote>Good story to stop idiots from mishandling sharp edges bases on their <br/>
experiences with dull, stainless steel kitchen knives, but no way. You <br/>
can give yourself a good slice but that would be the limit unless you <br/>
did something really swift and dropped it and the tried to catch it! Get <br/>
hold of some well sharpened carpenters tools or microtomes and then you <br/>
will now how sharp is sharp. I like old American chisels or the new <br/>
Japanese chisels, they are both high carbon steel that will take a great <br/>
edge. They have planing contests in Japan where they try to remove the <br/>
thinnest, most consistent shaving and in the old days they would pin <br/>
such things up in wood shops in the US.<br/>
