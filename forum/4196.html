<div id="ygrps-yiv-1205373807">I'm reading a interesting book by Giles Milton. It is about the first ships arived in japan in 1600. In particular it tells the story of William Adams.<br/>
I haven't finished it yet, but I can tell you something about his wives.<br/>
The one who remained in England survived with the provents that the Company of the Calls Oriental (compagnia delle Indie Orientali in italian...I don't know if this is the right traslation!) but I still don't know what happens to her next.<br/>
Then, Adams had another wife...a japanese one, who lived in his estate in Hemi.<br/>
As soon as I finish the book I'll tell you more!<br/>
SALUT!<br/>
