<h3>Clan Organization</h3>
by <i>spearweasel</i>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-98674126">I was reading about the bamboo plate armor of the ninja and how they <br/>
used the mystic disciplines of the Hagakure, which was written by <br/>
Musashi after the Mongol Wars.<br/>
<br/>
OK, I'm just kidding. <br/>
<br/>
Working on a Sengoku campaign, ca 1550 (as usual), and was curious. <br/>
Can anyone point me to a typical structure for a samurai clan of <br/>
moderate to large size? In addition to the daimyo, what specific <br/>
officers/ministers/apparatchiks/functionaries would such a clan have?<br/>
<br/>
Daimyo's bodyguard?<br/>
Council of important vassal daimyo?<br/>
Treasurer?<br/>
Official bean counter?<br/>
<br/>
What sorts of positions would be found in such a clan? I understand <br/>
that it will differ from clan to clan somewhat, but I would like to <br/>
get a clear picture of what sorts of offices there are and who would <br/>
typically fill them. <br/>
<br/>

 </span></blockquote>While I am not an expert on this area, I do have an interest as <br/>
well.  May I suggest the "Clan Structure" and other pertinent pages <br/>
on the Yama Kaminari website?  <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.nb.net/~kmeg/kaminari/">http://www.nb.net/~kmeg/kaminari/</a><br/>
