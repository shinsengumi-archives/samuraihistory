<h3>Re: [samuraihistory] Aging samurai</h3>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-133685924">Well, as a person who had been trained in the ancient<br/>
martial arts and strategy at the earlier ages, I do<br/>
think that I have some quailification to respond to<br/>
this message.<br/>
<br/>
Can a Samurai "retire"? I have not heard of such words<br/>
in my entire life. How old was Shingen when he led his<br/>
campaign  and was invincible against 'young' Tokugawa<br/>
Ieyasu and Oda Nobunaga? How old was Yamamoto Kansuke<br/>
when he joined Singen?<br/>
<br/>
Admiral Lee, Sun-Shin who was commanding the Korean<br/>
Navy during the Japanese invasion in the 16 century<br/>
became either a second Lieutenant or a capatian in the<br/>
modern military rank when he was 32 years old because<br/>
he hurt his left leg during the military officer<br/>
selection exam 4 years before. But, he became one of<br/>
the greatest warrior or samurai in history.<br/>
<br/>
I am sure that we can find a lot of similar examples<br/>
in the western history such as Sir William who<br/>
defeated Napoleon. <br/>
<br/>
Although I wish a success in your search for the<br/>
Japanese word for the retired or aging(how old?), I do<br/>
not think that a samurai can retire even if he tries<br/>
hard.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
               Sincerely,<br/>
<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Well, historically, retired folk were "inkyo" but that's not anything <br/>
particularly "samurai" related.<br/>
<br/>
Samurai was a (hereditary) social status, like the class of the hereditary <br/>
knightly class in Europe -- it wasn't a job. You don't retire from a social <br/>
class. You die.<br/>

  Samurai did retire - they just didn't stop being Samurai - Mori Motonari 'retired' in favor of his son Takamoto to lead the Mori clan (although he obviously didn't give up his influence on the direction of the clan).  I don't think the question was "what is it called when a Samurai stops being a Samurai".... <br/>
