<h3>Toshie Maeda</h3>
by <i>asianguy007us</i>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1000904016">Toshie Maeda was a pivotable samurai figure in Japanese history, who <br/>
knew all three of the unifers, Oda Nobunaga, Hideyoshi Toyotomi, and <br/>
Tokugawa Ieyasu.  There is a Japanese samurai television series <br/>
called Toshie and Matsu.  I would like to know if what is depicted of <br/>
the relationship between Oda Nobunaga and Toshie Maeda is <br/>
historically accurate, or rather, what is the story between the two <br/>
samurai.  The television drama depicts a sense of true friendship, <br/>
though stormy relationship in that Maeda is a kind, pure, <br/>
sincere "bullet" for Oda, the reason the latter saw in the young <br/>
Maeda capability beyond bullet concept--that hear is a man he could <br/>
depend and necessarily be a yes man.  I like to hear from a member <br/>
who could direct to read something on Toshie Maeda. I hope someone <br/>
can be kind to me and help me to understand better.<br/>
<br/>
Most sincerely,</div>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1292888941">Hi all,<br/>
 On Maeda Toshiie I have the following basic information regarding his <br/>
relations with Oda Nobunaga and his rise in that system. <br/>
 Toshiie lived from 1538 to 1599 and was born in the province of Owari. This <br/>
was a bonus to him because the Oda families strength was in using a select <br/>
core of men from Owari (Nobunaga's home province) as captains of Oda's armies <br/>
and Horse guards.<br/>
 He was given the fief of Fuchu in Echizen (33,000 Koku) and was one third of <br/>
the group called the 'Fuchu Sanninshu' or Fuchu triumvate, a group of strong <br/>
vassals serving under the Oda house.<br/>
 As one of Nobunaga's retainers from the years around his (Oda's) fathers <br/>
death Maeda was a trusted and reliable part of the Oda clan and was one of a <br/>
group of samurai entrusted with the running of the armies for Nobunaga...As <br/>
such you could presume that their relationship was based on a high degree of <br/>
both trust and reliability. <br/>
 Toshiie was moved from Fuchu to Noto province in 1581 but the evidence on <br/>
the move seems not to show that he was moved because of distrust but rather <br/>
moved to support the group of Maeda's vassals as one unit and allow the group <br/>
to expand. This again supports the strong picture of a deep trust between the <br/>
two.<br/>
 The picture that emerges is of a relationship of both trust and dependance <br/>
on Maeda from Nobunaga...How far this went is unclear although it is probable <br/>
that the TV series has invented much of the relationship to promote <br/>
storyline. They were close, trusting and friendly and as a Captain of the Oda <br/>
forces Maeda would need to have been!<br/>
 Good books to read on the two of them are "The Samurai sorcebook" by Stephen <br/>
Turnbull which provides a very basic overview and a little information on <br/>
them both. Another one to read is "Japonius Tyrranus" by Jerome Lamers...Both <br/>
available through Amazon I think...<br/>
