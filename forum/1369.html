<h3>Hello Sensei Shinsei</h3>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-133076839">Shinsei and friends,<br/>
   I have been wanting to ask another question about Masamune and his<br/>
teacher. You confirmed that Masamunes other name was Koumitsushi.(Shi <br/>
meaning teacher or master)<br/>
 Masamunes teachers name was Shintogo Kunimitsu. Did Shintogo ever use <br/>
the name or sign with Kunimitsushi? Thank You all,</div>

Actutually "Shi" sometimes means "sensei" ,such as in Koushi<br/>
(Confucious),but it often means "child".And the kanji used <br/>
in"sisho"and "onshi" is another one.<br/>
<br/>
I guess you know Yukimitsu.Some say he was  Masamune's father.I think <br/>
the "koumitsushi" signature might be one evidence to the <br/>
hypothesis.Koumitsushi can be read as "Yukimitsu-ga-Ko"(Yukimitsu's <br/>
son).<br/>
<br/>
Anyway I don't know any examples "Kunimitsushi" is used by Kunimitsu <br/>
himself.<br/>
<br/>
