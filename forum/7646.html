SASEBO NAVAL BASE, Japan  An area scholar of the Japanese samurai <br/>
culture and a pair of kendo masters visited the Harbor View Club on <br/>
Sunday and presented a lecture about samurai, a display of centuries-<br/>
old swords and an exhibition of ancient kendo movements.<br/>
<br/>
Navy spouse Holly Mateikat counts among her friends samurai scholar <br/>
and collector Naomi Itoh, fifth-degree kendo master Ikuo Matsuo and <br/>
his teacher, eighth-degree master Tsuyoshi Fukugawa. She thought an <br/>
event showcasing Japanese culture could be a rich experience for the <br/>
base community.<br/>
<br/>
"I felt it would serve to help Americans understand and appreciate <br/>
the culture of our host country," she said. "I also hoped it would <br/>
enhance the relationship established between our two countries.<br/>
<br/>
"It was wonderful for my Japanese friends, too. They were truly <br/>
flattered and appreciative that we were so interested in their <br/>
culture and traditions."<br/>
<br/>
The event, hosted by the base Morale, Welfare and Recreation <br/>
department, started with the lecture, which was translated for those <br/>
attending, and was followed by the martial arts exhibition.<br/>
<br/>
"Seeing some of the real samurai swords here was cool, especially <br/>
with some being more than 300 years old," said Sasebo dependent Leif <br/>
Bogen. "I've never seen the razor-sharp real ones before, just the <br/>
cheap ones in stores," he added.<br/>
<br/>
"This was very interesting, especially the history of the swords," <br/>
said Navy spouse Christopher Lambert.<br/>
<br/>
The culture-sharing event is of the sort MWR Director Scott <br/>
Poluhowich said he'd like to host more often.<br/>
<br/>
"We try and, certainly, we'd like to have more events like this," he <br/>
said. "It's just a matter of making contacts in the area community <br/>
who are willing to volunteer, and having people from the base <br/>
community suggest and assist in making the connections."<br/>
