<div id="ygrps-yiv-393603296">Hi,<br/>
<br/>
My name is Lindsey and I am in eighth grade. I have been assigned a project in school on Samurai and as part of my assignment I must *interview* an "expert" on the subject.  This is my second request for help, but I am afraid maybe I didn't explain very well the first time.  I must also do research as part of my assignment, but I really need to *interview* someone.  I only have about 10 questions.  Is there anyone on this list who might be able to help me?<br/>
<br/>
Thanks!<br/>

The problem is, most of us here are enthusiasts, but<br/>
hesitate to call ourselves "experts". Feel free to<br/>
send me your questions and I will try to help, but my<br/>
help may be pointing you towards someone else who is<br/>
more qualified. <br/>
