 </span></blockquote>Um, why? Being Japanese doesn't mean you're required<br/>
to commit seppuku.<br/>
A legitimate point, to be sure.  But by way of background, my father used a<br/>
.30-06 on himself as a way of redeeming his honour (an oversimplification,<br/>
but pretty accurate), and it's left me with a profound distaste for that<br/>
method of departure.  I watched my mother deal with the emotional<br/>
consequences of the act for another ten years.  So I've looked at the idea a<br/>
little more intimately than most gaijin, I think, and my personal belief is<br/>
that there are better ways to go, no matter what the problem.  I feel - and<br/>
it is strictly my feeling - that it's better to stand back up again and go<br/>
on, trying to heal one's honour in life, or (in warfare) to go down<br/>
fighting.<br/>
I compare Asano's seppuku in Inagaki's "Chushingura" with Mishima's - thank<br/>
you one and all for reminding me of his name - and in Mishima's I see a very<br/>
human reaction to a degree of pain that I think excessive.  Within my own<br/>
personal structure of honour, and without slighting a number of very great<br/>
men who took this way out, seppuku is not a valid way of making a statement.<br/>
Without doubt it requires courage and immense fortitude ('guts' would be too<br/>
cruel a pun), but by and large it still seems to me ultimately less<br/>
courageous than the ongoing effort to live and continue to grow, and to<br/>
redeem honour in life.  Referring once again to "Chushingura," I have more<br/>
respect for the bushi who elected not to die at once, but instead to make<br/>
good the pledges and debts of the han, than I do for Asano's inflexible<br/>
pride that took him to that end, at the cost not only of his life but of the<br/>
livelihoods of his samurai, his wife and children, and the commoners under<br/>
his care.  I regard power as properly an obligation, rather than a<br/>
privilege.  Giri - as I see it - requires a greater care for one's<br/>
dependents.<br/>
Don't mean to start a big philosophical argument, but you did ask why...<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
You're thinking of Mishima Yukio, the author. It<br/>
wasn't at a television station, it was at Ichigaya,<br/>
the then military academy, now the headquarters of the<br/>
Japan Defense Agency (think the Japanese Pentagon).<br/>
I've stood in the spot where he did the deed. It<br/>
wasn't simply a protest, it was a botched and horribly<br/>
failed attempt to get the students to rise up in a<br/>
coup--they laughed at him, and he withdrew to attempt<br/>
his fairly botched suicide.<br/>
	Thank you for the corrections.  Is it also incorrect, then, that the act<br/>
was filmed?  I had understood this to be the case.<br/>

<br/>
 Seppuku is considered a more genteel and less plebean or vulgar term.<br/>
Compare<br/>
the use in English of some French terms instead of regular English. Some<br/>
examples: "mutton" to replace the good old Anglo-Saxon "sheep meat"; "It has<br/>
a<br/>
certain 'je ne sais quois'" rather than "it has a certain 'I don't know<br/>
what'";<br/>
or "that was its raison d'être" rather than "that was its reason for being."<br/>
<br/>
Tony<br/>
<br/>
	Of course in the case of 'mutton' vs. 'sheep meat,' we have the Norman<br/>
conquest to consider as well.  Englishmen were growing the sheep, but it was<br/>
their Norman masters eating it:  so with 'cow' and 'beef', 'sheep' and<br/>
'mutton', 'pig' and 'pork', we have the English term for the animal, but the<br/>
French-derived term for the meat.<br/>
	The comparison I've made is between "he ended his life" and "he blew his<br/>
brains out."  My understanding - notwithstanding my semi-flippant 'glad to<br/>
be gaijin' comment - is that the peasantry didn't find the practise any more<br/>
admirable or comprehensible than many gaijin do, and hence used<br/>
'belly-slitting' rather than a more polite term for the act.  Again, please<br/>
feel free to correct me.<br/>

''An inglorious and messy end for a<br/>
dedicated man.''<br/>
No way!<br/>
	With no disrespect intended, I'll stick to my opinion on this - I refer you<br/>
to Nate's summary of the "fairly botched suicide".  If you attempt to follow<br/>
the traditions of your ancestors in your departure, and those traditions<br/>
call for a calm and composed reaction to horrible pain, while your emulation<br/>
of the act results in being unable to hold still enough to do it with style<br/>
and grace, then I think my description pretty accurate.  Note that I do not<br/>
criticise his honour:  but I cannot think that Mishima meant to make his<br/>
exit so different from the calm and resolute endurance that seppuku is<br/>
supposed to entail.  I would have wished him a better ending, for it is<br/>
apparent that it meant a very great deal to him.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
''This is one of those things that makes me intensely glad to be a gaijin,<br/>
''<br/>
Mishima is the person who makes me regret mostly that I am a gaijin.<br/>
<br/>
	Of all the people in Japanese history who have evoked that feeling in me, I<br/>
confess that Mishima is not on the list.  Musashi, yes.  Hidetsuna, yes.<br/>
(He's the one who reportedly shaved his head to rescue a peasant child,<br/>
scorning class privilege and social rank, in the episode Kurosawa borrowed<br/>
for "Seven Samurai.")  Hiroshige and Hokusai, yes.  Mifune, yes again -<br/>
because only in Japan, I think, can you have one of your great dramatic<br/>
actors in the same person as one of your leading action stars:  Spencer<br/>
Tracy and John Wayne in one, so to speak.  The poet who wrote _The Narrow<br/>
Road to the Far North_, even.  (Yet another name I've forgotten over the<br/>
years.)  Again, this is not meant to criticise you.  What is it about<br/>
Mishima that affects you so, if I may ask?<br/>

 </span></blockquote>My condolences. I don't wish to sound callous, but<br/>
your feelings seem to be more directed at suicide in<br/>
general, rather than seppuku in particular. Again, you<br/>
don't have to be Japanese to commit suicide (as you<br/>
tragically are aware) and you don't have to commit<br/>
seppuku to be Japanese. <br/>
<br/>
Of course I agree that "sticking it out" is much more<br/>
honorable than what many in the west call suicide,<br/>
"taking the easy way out". Even if that way is neither<br/>
easy nor pleasant. <br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> > 	Thank you for the corrections.  Is it also<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>It may have been, I'm not sure. I know that a short<br/>
while before, Mishima made a movie where the pivotal<br/>
scene was a seppuku (performed by him), a sort of<br/>
foreshadowing, if you will. The scene was intensely<br/>
graphic, and if I believe correctly he actually did<br/>
cut himself (on accident this time). Copious amounts<br/>
of fake blood were used. This is third hand info, as<br/>
I've not seen the scene, and only had it described by<br/>
my Japanese lit teacher in college (a few years back).<br/>
The recreation of the recreation is recreated in the<br/>
biographical movie of his life. <br/>
<br/>
 The poet<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> > who wrote _The Narrow<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Matsuo Basho is the poet you're looking for. And I<br/>
agree, I've got no desire to emulate Mishima.<br/>
Personally, he was a nutjob, out of touch with<br/>
reality, as was proven when he attempted to cause a<br/>
coup and even the students at Ichigaya laughed at him.<br/>
The books of his I've read are, well, disturbing.<br/>
Hardly my favorite author, much less someone who'd<br/>
make me want to be Japanese. <br/>
<br/>
Murakami Haruki, OTOH...<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-39864946">Mishima's meditation (or is that masturbation?) on duty and suicide <br/>
"Patriotism" was made into a short film, the seppuku scene was said to <br/>
last ten to fifteen minutes. The family destroyed all copies so as far <br/>
as we know none exist at this time. The same year he died, he appeared <br/>
in "Hitokiri" starring Katsu Shintaro as Okada Izo. Mishima played <br/>
Tanaka Shinbei a real life ronin who killed himself when confronted by <br/>
the police, check it out.<br/>
	Another method of seppuku, for the battlefield, was to grip the <br/>
wakizashi with right hand reversed, passing the blade behind the head, <br/>
laying the cutting edge on the neck and pull. The left hand could be <br/>
placed on the back of the blade to insure a deep cut. Remember Nobunaga <br/>
walked into the heart of a conflagration rather than give himself up, I <br/>
think most would agree his was an honorable choice.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>No one really knows. If they did, we'd either a. hear<br/>
about how the body was found by the Akechi, or b. how<br/>
some intrepid Oda samurai spirited away his head, to<br/>
keep it from falling into Mitsuhide's hands. <br/>
<br/>
As regaring whether Nobunaga's suicide was honorable<br/>
or not, I'd say in this case, sure, since he didn't<br/>
really have a choice. He fought against the Akechi<br/>
attack until he ran out of arrows and the situation<br/>
was hopeless, and retired to commit seppuku (as far as<br/>
is known) only at the last minute. There was no avenue<br/>
of escape, for him to "fight another day". <br/>
<br/>
To be honest, this attitude is perfectly accepted in<br/>
the military today--I've had several discussions with<br/>
fellow army officers where we all said we'd save a<br/>
bullet in our 9mm for us, should the prospect of being<br/>
captured by the north Koreans (I was stationed twice<br/>
along the DMZ) in the event of a war. However, the key<br/>
here really isn't the prospect of dishonor--to any<br/>
decent enemy, I'd fight until I couldn't fight<br/>
anymore, and then surrender if there was nothing else<br/>
I could do. However, Charles Jenkins notwithstanding,<br/>
the nK doesn't have a great reputation for treatment<br/>
of enemy soldiers, as with most communist regimes. I<br/>
admire men like John McCain quite a lot, but I'd be<br/>
sorely tempted to let my wife collect on my insurance<br/>
rather than face captivity under those conditions. <br/>
<br/>
Another question--where the heck does this "Digest<br/>
Number XXX" stuff come from? That wasn't the original<br/>
title of this thread. <br/>
