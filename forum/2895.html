<h3>Bushido pre-Hagakure</h3>
by <i>S. Lyle Parker</i>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-694809733">Hi.<br/>
<br/>
Sorry for the late response to this post and my apologies if someone else <br/>
has already addressed this issue.  I am trying to get caught up on my <br/>
list-reading, and am doing a fairly bad job.  Maybe when winter break <br/>
comes...<br/>
<br/>
Anyway, my understanding is that what later becomes referred to as Bushido <br/>
has many precursors that appeared prior to _Hagakure_.  It is a little out <br/>
of my period, but I recall that Yamaga Soko (1622-1685) wrote a treatise (or <br/>
portion thereof) that was entitled "shido".  In it he sets out what he <br/>
believes to be the correct comportment of a member of the samurai class.<br/>
<br/>
Apart from these all-encompassing "this is what a warrior is (or should be)" <br/>
type of texts, there are many ways in which warrior ideals were disseminated <br/>
and/or propaganidized.  Not the least of which would have been the war tales <br/>
-- albeit, as originally oral tales meant for nonliterate audiences.  Also, <br/>
many high-ranking warrior leaders from the Kamakura era onward wrote buke <br/>
kakun "warrior house codes" which were short treatises usually with a target <br/>
audience of the writer's successor/descendants as well as the higher ranking <br/>
retainers.  This is not to suggest, however, that there was anywhere near a <br/>
consensus as to "a warrior is X type of person, dresses in Y type of <br/>
clothing, and comports himself in Z manner", and as such no tidy overarching <br/>
ideal of a samurai to which all aspired.  So the kakun, although exhibiting <br/>
some similarities to one another, really reflected the inidividual <br/>
predilections of the author and to some extent the prevailing beliefs of the <br/>
time period in which they were written.<br/>
<br/>
An example of this is that the kakun from the early Medieval period often <br/>
stressed the importance of samurai improving their ability in letters <br/>
(writing, music, poetry, etc.)  This was likely due to the fact that the <br/>
warriors (mostly from the Eastern part of Japan) were coming into increasing <br/>
contact with the people of high breeding from Kyoto and found their <br/>
abilities in this area lacking. As the courtiers had had a monopoly on <br/>
governmental positions until the Kamakura period, their tastes and <br/>
refinements were, to a certain extent synonymous with governmental <br/>
authority.  The case is drastically different as regards kakun from the <br/>
Gekokujo period (1467 onward), at least as far as those written by samurai <br/>
that held court rank.  These men were highly literate and as such were not <br/>
concerned with whether their kids could read or write.  These house codes <br/>
are much more pragmatic in tone and generally deal with issues of immediate <br/>
concern to the preservation of the "clan" and its territories .<br/>
<br/>
So I guess, my points for this rant are as follows.  1) There were certainly <br/>
precursors to the ideals set forth in Hagakure, those from the period <br/>
immediately preceeding it being the closest in both form and tone.  2) There <br/>
was some sense of a warrior identity as far back as the Kamakura period, but <br/>
its specific articulation varied by person, geography and time period.<br/>
<br/>
In closing please allow me to aopologize for the incomplete reference, but I <br/>
am currently at "work" and dont have access to my files.  I will look into <br/>
the Yamaga Soko thing and will try to send more complete info in a day or <br/>
two.<br/>

the Samurai_ by William Scott Wilson<br/>

Hey Angry Lllama<br/>
<br/>
That is true what you said about the hagakure being a rather late <br/>
development (1716), but I<br/>
figure Yamamoto Tsunetomo was "standing on the shoulders" of those who went <br/>
before him.<br/>
To say that there was no bushido before 1716... is it really fair to claim <br/>
that? Just because it<br/>
wasn't written down? Sure, it may have varied from region to region and era <br/>
to era, but the<br/>
samurai as a caste surely had a set of expectations or ethics - whether <br/>
self-imposed or<br/>
imposed by others. If I'm way off base, let me know. Related to this, I'd <br/>
like to know: is there<br/>
any evidence for "bushido" prior to the Hagakure? What are the other main <br/>
pieces of samurai<br/>
literature?<br/>
<br/>
Thanks.<br/>
<br/>
