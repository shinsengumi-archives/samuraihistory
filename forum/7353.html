"I looked<br/>

well. The largest japanese "clan" would be clan yama kaminari.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1475747172">The SCA is mostly European culture, by definition.  There are "some" <br/>
chinese, mongol and japanese groups (as there are groups based in <br/>
fantasy) within the SCA but these are a small percentage.<br/>
<br/>
I have been in the SCA on and off since 1981 and have had people <br/>
actually talk me out of a samurai persona because they really are a <br/>
stretch according to the definition of the SCA.<br/>
