<h3>Samurai Essay</h3>

<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-448329342">Hi, I'm writing an essay about samurais. I was wondering if anyone<br/>
could answer my following questions. If you can't, do you know about<br/>
any websites where I can email someone about it?<br/>
Here is the questions<br/>
<br/>
1. How old were the boys when they were recruited as samurais?<br/>
2. Did you have to be of the the upper class to be become one?<br/>
3. Did they got to war against each other?<br/>
<br/>
These are my questions, it would be really great if you could take<br/>
some time to answer some of the questions. Thanks beforehand.</div>

<br/>
Samurai were a social class. This answers your first two questions.<br/>
<br/>
One was BORN into it. No one was "recruited" as a samurai.<br/>
<br/>
And as to three: of COURSE. They were the warrior class, of course  <br/>
they did.<br/>
<br/>
To write an essay, you really should READ some material rather than  <br/>
just asking questions. Let the material you read produce the questions  <br/>
as they answer others. Just about any cursory reading of ANYTHING on  <br/>
samurai (for example, the wikipedia article) would have had the  <br/>
answers to these questions.<br/>
