<div id="ygrps-yiv-1456386655">I'm a person who loves to encourage people to write more samurai fiction. So this contest works wonders for this. And I liked the different categories. And you gave plenty of notice as far as deadlines.<br/>
<br/>
Suggestions: <br/>
<br/>
1) Clarify the issue about stories that are sequels or prequels to an author's previous contest story. Either allow such stories, as long as the prequel/sequel can stand completely as an independent story. Or else make a rule that a writer cannot write a story about any character who was in any of his/her previous years' entries.<br/>
<br/>
2) You might want to allow a writer to enter more than one story, as long as each of an entrant's stories are in a different category.  <br/>
<br/>
3) I would make at least a suggestion that, as this is the "SAMURAI Fiction Contest", that the main character of any story actually be a samurai. Or else, if the POV character isn't a samurai, that the story centers on some sort of samurai character. I realize that in earlier eras of Japanese history, that samurai didn't exist as a distinct, separate class. So for these stories, it should center on a person who would perform a role that a samurai would perform i.e. fight in battles or studies a martial art.<br/>
<br/>
Just a few comments and suggestions. These contests are a lot of fun and I look forward to the 2007 Samurai Fiction Competition.<br/>

Good point. Common sense says it is fine as long as it is a complete <br/>
short story on its own, but since I didn't clarify that this time <br/>
around (didn't even think about it) it of course popped up.  I'll <br/>
clarify it this next time, same characters - fine as long as it is a <br/>
complete short story and doesn't read like a chapter in a larger <br/>
story.<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>

<br/>
Isn't that sort of like stuffing the balot box?  Although if I did <br/>
allow this, I would also have to require a seperate fee for each <br/>
story, which might make it interesting, story wise and money wise.<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
That is a tough one.  The first contest was very strict, and there <br/>
were good results. This one was less strict, and had a larger <br/>
variety. I'll have to think about this one, but I am taking it under <br/>
advisement. Technically speaking, the "historical fiction" option <br/>
covered this. So I'm drawn between the two - I don't want to <br/>
actively discourage anyone from entering by making it too strict, <br/>
but at the same time the more focused stories tend to be more <br/>
interestng, because the people with the knowledge and interest are <br/>
the ones who write them.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks for the thoughts.</div>
