<br/>
The skin of the arm pit is very soft and thin, with maojor arteries lying close to the surface of the skin. Whether the blade penetrated there or not, it the personis likely to bleed to death. Itd be like slicing across the jugular. I saw on a documentary "Ancient Warriors" on TLC a few years ago, that a slice from a katana could kill a man there in something like 8 seconds (I'll watch the video again to be sure, and let you  know if that number is off. Same thing as the wrists. Japanese armour doesnt do the greatest job at protecting the inner wrist.<br/>

	I believe that there was indeed protection for the armpit incorporated <br/>
in Japanese armour, and as early as the eleventh century. The kyubi no <br/>
ita and sendan no ita were plates of armour attached to the front of <br/>
the oyoroi that covered the armpits when the wearer raised his arms to <br/>
fire his bow.<br/>
