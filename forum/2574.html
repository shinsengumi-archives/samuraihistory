<div id="ygrps-yiv-1186999536">KonnichiWa Gang--Just saw where Kuchi, Japan has named their new airport <br/>
Kuchi Ryoto in honor of Ryoto Sakamoto the Samurai warrior from Kenshin <br/>
Himura's era (1860's). He was very active in the war which put Emporer Meiji <br/>
in power. Anybody know if he was a Hitokori Battousai? What was his clan? <br/>
Domo arigato for the aid. Happy Thanksgiving and Happy Birthday to Classic <br/>
Kei(Dirty Pair/Lovely Angels)(11-27-2121)and Happy Anniversary to my Mom and <br/>
Dad--all tomorrow the 27th!! Be sure to check out Tom Cruise in The Last <br/>
Samurai next month! See ya soon--Keiman and Kei.<br/>

	I am sure you mean Kochi on Shikoku. Home of Sakamoto Ryoma who lived <br/>
in Kochi when it was the captiol of Tosa-han. He was a loyalist, who <br/>
understood the threat presented by the Western powers as well as the <br/>
opportunities for trade and growth that might ensue from intercourse <br/>
with those same nations.<br/>
	While the Bakufu struggled to restore its former glory and the <br/>
Southwestern han struggled to bring it down, Ryoma sought a "Third <br/>
Way". Sadly he was killed before his genius could be fully utilized in <br/>
the service of his country.<br/>
	He was indeed an accomplished swordsman and is in fact MORE respected <br/>
because he never killed another man in anger, or to further his cause...<br/>
