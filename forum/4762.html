  Generally speaking a kodachi is shorter than a katana (daito/dachi) and <br/>
longer than a wakizashi (shoto).  The name kodachi literally means "short <br/>
longsword."  Or at least something similar to that.  It is still classified <br/>
as a long sword, and often weilded as such since it is possible to use both <br/>
hands on the tsuka (handle) whereas the wakizashi can only be used with one <br/>
hand due to the short tsuka.<br/>
  The advantage to a kodachi over a daito is that it is slightly faster to <br/>
move with, however it is shorter which means you have to get that much <br/>
closer to be effective with it.  All depends on what you want focus on, <br/>
speed or range.<br/>
  On a side note, the odachi that I mentioned before literally translates to <br/>
great longsword.  Just something else to add to the "prefix + dachi" thing.<br/>
  My appologies if my translations are off, I am still in the process of <br/>
teaching myself.  I will be taking more formal nihonga classes this fall.<br/>
<br/>
