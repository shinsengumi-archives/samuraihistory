<h3>SamuraiWiki - approved editors</h3>
by <i>kitsuno</i>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1177156917">The SamuraiWiki (http://wiki.samurai-archives.com) is now locked from<br/>
editing by new members. It goes without saying that you don't need to<br/>
sign up to READ everything on the site.<br/>
<br/>
If you wish to become an approved editor, please join the SamuraiWiki<br/>
Editor's Group: http://groups.yahoo.com/group/samuraiwiki/<br/>
<br/>
Post your interest in becoming an editor, what your<br/>
interests/specialties are in regards to Japanese history, what "areas"<br/>
of the SamuraiWiki you'd like to work in, and if applicable, feel<br/>
freet to mention any "qualifications".  If approved, you will gain the<br/>
ability to edit any unlocked articles, and to create new articles.<br/>
<br/>
These members are already Approved Editors:<br/>
