<h3>Asakura Yoshiaki</h3>
by <i>jckelly108</i>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1112076233">Hello all,<br/>
<br/>
A few weeks ago, in the context of another discussion, I asked what <br/>
the status of Yoshiaki was at the end of his life. What I was looking <br/>
for is whether the Emperor ever formally rescinded the title of Shogun <br/>
from Yoshiaki?<br/>
<br/>
I found this site on the web (in Japanese)<br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://homepage1.nifty.com/heiankyo/yomo19.html">http://homepage1.nifty.com/heiankyo/yomo19.html</a><br/>
and others, which indicate that Yoshiaki's title was never stripped <br/>
from him.<br/>
<br/>
Does anyone have any other documentation (primary or otherwise) <br/>
about this?<br/>
<br/>
It's often stated that the end of the Muromachi Shogunate came in <br/>
1573, and this is probably true de facto. But it's interesting to me <br/>
that Yoshiaki lived on until 1597s and he was in fact the <br/>
"de jure" Shogun for the entire time.<br/>

       Question: what's the difference between the Asakura Shogunate and the <br/>

Just a question.  :-)  Take care.<br/>

The Ashikaga Bakufu existed during the Muromachijidai, (and its collapse marked the end of the period), known by the district in Kyoto in which Ashikaga Takauji established his residence and offices, in 1338, two years after Takauji had established the Ashikaga in office.  <br/>

 </span></blockquote>I think I caused this trouble. Yes of course Yoshiaki was the last <br/>
of the Ashikaga Shogun - not Asakura. I am sure that I had Asakura on <br/>
the brain due to the research I've been doing on the early Oda <br/>
family.<br/>
<br/>
Sorry for the confusion. Lesson learned for me: I shall not not write <br/>
emails before at least one cup of coffee.<br/>
