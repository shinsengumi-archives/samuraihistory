<h3>Japanese army in Korea 1590s</h3>
by <i>burker94509</i>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1464414819">Does anyone know where I can find OBs for the Japanese army in Korean in the <br/>
1590s?<br/>
<br/>
I'm especially interested in the composition of the forces.   In other words, <br/>
what percentage of the forces, if any, were mounted samurai, samurai on foot <br/>
and the different types of ashigaru (and their weapons: bow, spear, swords, or <br/>
arquebus).<br/>
<br/>
Thanks in advance.<br/>

 <br/>
 </span></blockquote>Others might have better overall statistics, but the Shimazu listed the<br/>
following for 1591:<br/>
 <br/>
300 yari (200 of which are long yari), 200 hand-spears (not sure what<br/>
constitutes a hand-spear), 1,500 guns, 1,500 bows. That only describes a<br/>
force of 3,500, but perhaps might be typical, meaning 43% guns, 43%<br/>
bows, 14% yari. Swords would not have been primary weapons and would be<br/>
a personal weapon not counted in these registers.<br/>
 <br/>
As for mounted men vs foot soldiers, from 1597 the Shimazu listed the<br/>
following (I'm excluding labourers from this list):<br/>
 <br/>
262 mounted men, with 5068 personal followers on foot. 800 other foot<br/>
soldiers (landless men, muashi, and squires, kaji ko-sho), and 665<br/>
weapon bearers. If we exclude weapon bearers (or dogu, who may or may<br/>
not have actually fought in battle, I'm not sure), then that's 4%<br/>
mounted samurai with 96% foot soldiers. <br/>

<blockquote><span title="ireply"> >Samurai vs. Ashigaru?<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>That's harder to say. The source I'm getting this info from (the<br/>
Iriki-In documents) doesn't show the word that is being translated for<br/>
the 5,068 personal followers of the mounted samurai. This figure would<br/>
probably encompass ashigaru as well as higher ranking non-mounted<br/>
military men and samurai, and the higher ranking mounted samurai brought<br/>
more men with them than the lower ranking mounted samurai. <br/>
 <br/>
If I had to throw out a completely unscientific guess I would maybe<br/>
suggest an average of 2-3 followers per mounted samurai being men<br/>
ranking higher than ashigaru. That seems reasonable to me, but it<br/>
wouldn't shock me too much if I was completely wrong. As for the<br/>
landless men and squires, I'm really not sure. Landless men would<br/>
probably count as ashigaru, or non-samurai footmen to be more accurate,<br/>
but without knowing too much about the kaji kosho (squires) it's hard to<br/>
say what their function would be. <br/>
 <br/>
The translator used the english term 'squire' for the kaji kosho, which<br/>
could mean they were semi-aristocratic men who may have in turn had<br/>
their own followers, or they could have been non-combatant general<br/>
attendants. They were listed as having their own labourers assigned to<br/>
them, so that suggests that maybe they were likely the former - men of<br/>
some standing who may not have been direct retainers of the Shimazu,<br/>
maybe village headmen and the like. In that case some may have worn<br/>
armour, but they probably would have functioned as ashigaru assigned<br/>
under a samurai commander.<br/>
 <br/>
Again though, I'm just guessing here. Maybe someone else might be able<br/>
to shed some light on some of this?<br/>
