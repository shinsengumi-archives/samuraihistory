<h3>Maeda family</h3>
by <i>K. L. Horn</i>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1874354136">Hello all. I'm new at this and hope i am going about it the right <br/>
way. My name is Kenji and I am the product of a post WW2 <br/>
Marine/Japanese marriage. I have a limited amount of info on my <br/>
Japanese heritage, but here's what I do know:<br/>
 My grandfather (mother's father) was named Kikuma Maeda. <br/>
Until my mother's marriage to my US born father, her family was<br/>
of Samurai lineage. She is from Sasebo and I know that their family <br/>
owned all or part of a MT near there prior to the war. Her brother <br/>
is still in possession of the family Katana, which is about 400 years <br/>
old. Unfortunately, my grandfather died when my mother was a little <br/>
girl, my grandmother died when I was young, my mother has limited <br/>
knowledge of her ancestry and there is a communication barrier with<br/>
my <br/>
Uncles overseas. Also, at about the time of my grandfather's death,<br/>
WW2 began and it seems that much of the knowledge never passed on.<br/>
Anyhow, I would greatly appreciate any info anyone can offer dealing <br/>
with the Maeda clan, their samurai background, lineage, etc. (I have<br/>
read what is available on the Samurai-bigsite-city website). Thanks <br/>
for your time and sorry for the rambling.</div>
