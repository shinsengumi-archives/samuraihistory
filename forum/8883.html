<h3>Third Annual Samurai Fiction Contest</h3>
by <i>kitsuno</i>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-104539883">I have already posted this to the Samurai Archives Citadel Forum, but<br/>
I want to catch everyone so I am posting here as well.  I am in the<br/>
preparation stages for the rules, regs, and parameters for the third<br/>
annual Samurai Fiction contest.<br/>
<br/>
Here is some information:<br/>
<br/>
This time around I will expand the number of genres available, however<br/>
this time I will make them more strict. Previously, the "Historical<br/>
Fiction" section was the only genre with any real "rules" for how it<br/>
was to be done. This time around, to make it fair, I will add one or<br/>
two requirements per genre.<br/>
<br/>
Also, this time the entry fee will be on a sliding time scale - that<br/>
not might be a "real" English phrase, so let me explain:<br/>
<br/>
If you sign up for the contest between now and September 15th, 2006,<br/>
the fee will be $7.<br/>
<br/>
If you sign up for the contest between September 16th and December<br/>
31st, 2006 the fee will be $10.<br/>
<br/>
If you sign up for the contest between January 1st and the deadline of<br/>
March 31st, 2007 the fee will be $15.<br/>
<br/>
So, hopefuly it will encourage the procrastinators to sign up and<br/>
start writing early. As before, the winner of the contest will win the<br/>
entire pot minus 5% to cover paypal fees, and this year, if we can get<br/>
over 10 entries, I will throw in some of my own money for the winner<br/>
(depending if there is a strike where I work or not - so as soon as I<br/>
decide how much, I'll let you know.) I am still debating how much, but<br/>
it may be substantial - so if you are interested, or if you know<br/>
someone who would be interested, let people know - the more entries,<br/>
the higher the prize.<br/>
<br/>
If you want to join, PayPal the registration fee (currently $7) to<br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="mailto:webmaster@...">webmaster@...</a> - as always, please list with your<br/>
paypal payment along with your name as many as applicable: Your Yahoo<br/>
ID, your Delphi Forums ID (even if that forum is no longer really in<br/>
use) and your Samurai Archives Citadel ID. This is so that I can keep<br/>
easy track of who has entered.<br/>
<br/>
The entry fee is non-refundable unless there is no contest. But there<br/>
will be a contest.<br/>
<br/>
If anyone knows they will not enter, but wants to judge, let me know.<br/>
If you sign up as judge now, but eventually decide to enter, that's<br/>
fine, too. You'll be removed from the judges circle to enter into the<br/>
contest. Like always, I won't be judging, since I will be the one<br/>
receiving the stories. I will just moderate the proceedings.<br/>
<br/>
Feel free to ask any questions.<br/>
<br/>
I will keep updating as things progress.</div>
