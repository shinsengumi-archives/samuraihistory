<h3>Re: [samuraihistory] samurai for hire</h3>

<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1125263866">A small corps of samurai (perhaps 800-strong) were maintained by King of Ayutthaya.  In 1628 they put down the opposition movement against the successor to King Thom.  They were maintained by King Ekathotsarot of Ayutthaya (the kingdom in place prior to present-day Thailand), when Ayutthaya attracted a number of foreign merchants from ming China and the Netherlands, but in 1620 they were forced into flight after Ekathotsarot was defeated during a palace coup led by Songdhamrna.<br/>
The leader of this group of Yamada Nagamasa (1590-1630), who became lord of Nakhon Si Thammarat (in present-day southern Thailand), but he died after being wounded fighting supporters of King Songtham.  <br/>
