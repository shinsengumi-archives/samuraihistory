"Unbeaten Tracks in Japan: An account of travels in the interior<br/>
including visits to the aborigines of Yezo and the Shrine of Nikko"<br/>
Isabella L Bird, written 1878.<br/>
<br/>
I have found this book and have only had a chance for a quick perusal.<br/>
<br/>
"The house-master is of the samurai, or two-sworded class, now, as<br/>
such, extinct. His face is longer, his lips thinner, and his nose<br/>
straighter and more prominent than those of the lower class, and there<br/>
is a difference in his manner and bearing. I have had a great deal of<br/>
interesting conversation with him."<br/>
Although the class has gone, the author notes on a couple of occasions<br/>
this difference in bearing.<br/>
<br/>
The other note is the stunning beauty of the countryside on the one<br/>
hand, and the utter and abject squalor, poverty and misery of the<br/>
general rural population on the other. Full of interesting observation.<br/>
