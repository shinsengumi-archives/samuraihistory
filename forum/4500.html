 </span></blockquote>Whatever you are, you seem not to have problems in telling what is <br/>
right from what is wrong.<br/>
Where is that security coming from? It doesn't matter if you're a <br/>
Muslim fundamentalist, or a Hindu who believes in 300.000.000 of Gods, <br/>
when you judge so straightforwardly you show that you are pointing back <br/>
to some truth you recognize as ultimate.<br/>
That might be right according to YOUR point of view, but let me tell <br/>
you that it is a very surpassed approach when it comes to history.<br/>
At least, admit that your opinion is subjective.<br/>
The discussion is interesting if anybody proposed something, not if the <br/>
participants try to impose their own ideas.<br/>
