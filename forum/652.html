<div id="ygrps-yiv-1532292826">I'm Jonathan and I decided to join this group because of a recently <br/>
developing interest of mine in Feudal Japan and the Samurai.  I guess <br/>
my most recent re-reading of James Clavell's Shogun did it.  Third <br/>
times the charm.  <br/>
I don't have much in the way of expertise, only a desire to learn <br/>
more.  I am interested especially in the Tokugawa Bakufu since that <br/>
seems to have been th pinacle of Samurai power in Japan (at least I <br/>
have been lead to believe that), but I also wish to learn about the <br/>
other Bakufus and about Japanese mythology and its links to Shinto <br/>
and Buddhism.</div>

I gotr into the site first because of my interest in the martial arts and the <br/>
warriors code, I'm now studying the ancient samurai forms of un-armed self <br/>
defense, the 1,000 year old to todays jiu jitsu, judo and aikido.  Any <br/>
questions let me know and you should try to down load the Hagakure, code of <br/>
the samuirai, its a great book with many insights.  I have to go , I have <br/>
judo this morn. zenlex.</div>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1366384185">Hi Zenlex, <br/>
 Regarding the reply that stated that "I am studying the 1,000 years old to <br/>
today's Jiu jitsu, Judo, and Aikido"...<br/>
 I hate to put a  dampener on things but it is highly unlikely that you are <br/>
studying any Ryu-ha that is this old..Unless you happen to be a Deshi in the <br/>
Sho Sho Ryu which claims descent from Fujiwara Kamatari..And even this is <br/>
dubious.<br/>
 The oldest PROVEN Ryu-ha that is currently extant is the Tenshin Shoden <br/>
Katori Shinto Ryu (from the 14th century)....And the oldest PROVEN Ryu-ha for <br/>
primarily Jujutsu techniques is the Takenouchi Ryu..Regarding Judo and <br/>
Aikido, BOTH of these are Gendai Budo and little more than 150 years old at <br/>
the most..Although Aikido can claim descent back to around the 16th century <br/>
through the links with the Daito Ryu..again..Dubious.<br/>
 As I said I do not want to put you off training...That is always good to <br/>
hear..Only please check that what you describe is correct and not simply the <br/>
'advertising' that many ryu now use to attract trainees..It puts a mark on <br/>
the reat of the Budo of Japan and helps to attract the glory hunters more <br/>
than it should..Helping no one.<br/>
 Abayo.</div>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-360831613">Thanks for the warm welcome.<br/>
I'd like to download the Hagakure that you spoke of.  What is the web <br/>
address for it?  Thanks.<br/>
