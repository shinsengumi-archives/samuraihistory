<h3>Japanese history book source</h3>
by <i>wahmeister</i>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-630942689">Hello,<br/>
 As you know there is a "United States library of congress" where any <br/>
book can be found that was printed in the US.<br/>
 Is there an equivilent Library in Japan where hard to find Japanese <br/>
history books can be found for doing research?<br/>
I am looking for a copy of the Kyoho MeibutsuCho. <br/>
  I would appreciate your help, L.Berry</div>
