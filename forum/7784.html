<br/>
If anyone who doesn't plan to enter is interested in judging, let me <br/>
know.<br/>
<br/>
This year there is a choice of 8 genres. The stories must involve <br/>
Japan or the Samurai, and the story may take place any time up to, <br/>
but no later than the end of the 19th century, and may take place at <br/>
any point in Japanese history before this.<br/>
<br/>
Requirements: <br/>
<br/>
This is to be a piece of fiction writing taking place within an <br/>
unspecified period in Japanese history up to the late 19th century, <br/>
it is only optional to involve a real samurai from Japanese history <br/>
or a historical event except where noted by genre. The genre is <br/>
completely open from comedy to sci-fi.<br/>
<br/>
Parameters: <br/>
<br/>
The story is required to be more than 1,000 words, with a 5,000 word <br/>
targeted limit - overages are acceptable. It can be done in the <br/>
first person, or the third person, and must be a complete short <br/>
story, not an excerpt from a larger story. The genre(s) must be <br/>
listed at the top of the story above the title - one genre or a <br/>
combination of two genres are acceptable. Although the particular <br/>
genre will not affect judging, all entrants are required to make <br/>
sure that their story falls within their chosen genre(s).<br/>
<br/>
Further Info:<br/>
<br/>
The entrance fee is $10 - the winner will receive the combined total <br/>
of all entrance fees minus 5% to conver the paypal fees, therefore, <br/>
the more entrants, the larger the payoff for the winner.<br/>
