 </span></blockquote>Who mentioned movies? Who mentioned historically correct details regarding the ninja? How would you be an authority on the ninja?<br/>
You study Budo by your own admission. It is very rude by every cultures beliefs to denounce that of which you are ignorant.<br/>
<br/>
And ignorant of such matters you are.<br/>
<br/>
Whether the term "Ninja" appeared in Japan  _ever_  is no matter. Nowdays it is an accepted layman's term. Whether you like it or<br/>
not. And the world will use it without you.<br/>
<br/>
I have respect for the way of Bu, but not for you, because you are ignorant, and have no respect for anything but your own<br/>
"knowledge". Of which you probably know nothing outside of Budo teachings, and the odd bit of book reading here or there by authors<br/>
who are also no authority on the subjects which they publish books on.<br/>
<br/>
That is my last comment on the matter on the list, if you wish to comment youself, which you no doubt would accept to do without<br/>
thought, then you have my e-mail address and have my invitation to mail me personally for any reason.<br/>

<br/>
Are you ten years old?<br/>
If you disagree with someone, so be it, but that was the rudest display of<br/>
adolescent behavior I have seen in a very long time.<br/>
Show some respect.<br/>
People from various martial arts are passed verbal transmissions of their<br/>
"history" and the reasons for various traditions revolving around that art.<br/>
As mentioned in this diatribe, I am a student of Aikido. Daito ryu more<br/>
specifically.<br/>
In our art, the hakama is gifted to a shodan. It is believed by our shihan<br/>
that the hakama was worn for both ceremony and ease of movement for combat<br/>
in an "in-house" circumstance.<br/>
In another art there may have been different traditions or circumstances<br/>
surrounding its use.<br/>
However, regardless of any one teaching, you must consider the fact that the<br/>
hakama was Japanese, not the tool of martial arts. It was worn by<br/>
practitioners and "lay" folk alike. Martial arts all stemmed from India and<br/>
developed into numerous styles over many generations throughout all of the<br/>
orient, taking on various characteristics by each major clan and teacher.<br/>
The hakama was just a garment that simply followed the Japanese during their<br/>
day, and when one clan broke from another ... or one family divided and<br/>
became two ... when they moved on they took their hakamas with them. Perhaps<br/>
after the fact each determined that it had certain combative attributes. Who<br/>
can truly say?<br/>
I know that YOU weren't there any more than Eric was, so certainly you can't<br/>
answer the question with any more authority than he could.<br/>
In any case, people have different reasons for the things they think and<br/>
believe, and not all of it is rootless. Unless YOU are the expert on all<br/>
these matters, which I do not believe you are, try to have a little<br/>
sensitivity in rebuking information you BELIEVE is incorrect.<br/>

<br/>
you have come on and written these long booklength<br/>
responses twice now with absolutley no respect for the<br/>
people who wrote the originals.  Then you have the<br/>
nerve to say that they should be "sensitivity" when<br/>
rebuking responses.  I am not even sure who you are<br/>
responding to but just chill out man.  No one here has<br/>
ever said that there info was more valid.  This is a<br/>
discussion group anyway right.  People put stuff up<br/>
and others respond.  the only one getting all upset is<br/>
you...  If you are going to put up a response that has<br/>
to do with your side of a argument please do so. <br/>
However if you are going to critisize how others<br/>
respond and what they respond with please just join<br/>
another group.  You asked the question whether the<br/>
person you are responding to is ten years old.  You<br/>
are the one obviously offended and not able to control<br/>
yourself.  Are You ten years old????  Please if you<br/>
have some response to a question someone sends or a<br/>
disagreement with info that is sent feel free to<br/>
respond but stop insulting and sending responses that<br/>
have no value to the group as a whole.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-12894380">There was NO need to be so impolite, caling someone<br/>
"ignorant" just because their info MAY be innaccurate,<br/>
is childish.<br/>
<br/>
what makes you such an authority on the subject? how<br/>
much research have you done? books read? <br/>
<br/>
Even if you are the ultimate master of all martial<br/>
knowledge, this does not give you the right to so<br/>
rudley rebuke another person.<br/>
<br/>
The teachings of Bushido clearly state that<br/>
impoliteness is a thing not worthy of a Samurai, or<br/>
one who studies the Martial arts. Think on this for<br/>
future reference.<br/>
