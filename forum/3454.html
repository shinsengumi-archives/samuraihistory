<h3>Re:Gasaraki/shintoism mysticism questions</h3>

<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1145841067">Sorry Keiman<br/>
<br/>
Didn't was able to find anything about Gasaraki<br/>
Do ya are sure it was not a mispelling?<br/>
<br/>
Shintoism is not my strong point anyway.<br/>
But I've found some answers that may have something to do with what ye are<br/>
searching for.<br/>
<br/>
For "kai", I found this:<br/>
Kai-i<br/>
Ranks within the Shinto Priesthood. There are four ranks: jô (purity), mei<br/>
(brightness), sei (righteousness), and choku (uprightness). Regulations for<br/>
ranking are fixed by the Jinja Honchô.<br/>
<br/>
Jinja Honchô<br/>
Association of Shinto Shrines organized when the nation's shrines were<br/>
disestablished as a result of the Occupation order issued in 1945.<br/>
Membership includes most of all shrines in Japan (about 80.000 shrines) and<br/>
about 20.000 priests. Guided by the spiritual leadership of Ise no Jingû.<br/>
The Jinja Honchô works to preserve Shrine Shinto (Jinja Shinto) and to<br/>
Maintain Principles of integrity. Its head office is in Tokyo, and local<br/>
brances (jinjachô) are located throughout Japan.<br/>
<br/>
Jinja Shintô<br/>
Shrine Shinto. The traditional religious practices carried on in shrines<br/>
throughout Japan's history, as well as the attitudes toward life which<br/>
support these practices. At the core of this religion exists a reverent<br/>
religious experience which has prevailed from antiquity and which leads<br/>
Japanese believers to experience the will and activity of the gods through<br/>
various events of everyday life. Shrine Shinto claims no founder, but<br/>
through the interpretation of classical mythology and the re-evaluation of<br/>
folk ways, it is gradually organizing its own theology. The<br/>
politico-theoretical side of Jinja-Shintô is called Kokka Shintô or State<br/>
Shinto. At present there are in Japan some 80.000 shrines of which some 97<br/>
percent belong to the Jinja Honchô.<br/>
<br/>
Kugutsu and Kugai, I didn't found anything about.<br/>
<br/>
I found however Asagutsu:<br/>
A kind of shoe worn by nobles in ancient times, and by Shinto priests during<br/>
the performance of certain religious ceremonies today. Believed to have<br/>
originally been constructed of leather, asagutsu have been made of hollowed<br/>
paulownia wood finished in black lacquer since the Heian period.<br/>
<br/>
You can perhaps have more acess to shinto mysticism without becoming a<br/>
priest, through shugendo, but you will surelly face the Honji Suijaku Setsu<br/>
cosmogony inside the Shinbutsu Shûgô that I already have mentioned before.<br/>
<br/>

Post Scriptum: I could put the kanji of the japanese mentioned names here,<br/>
but does not have any apropriate software do input such data in the email.<br/>
Does anybody know any freeware download I can do for that purpose?<br/>

the four base words in gasaraki. That is ga, sa, ra, ki. They are in the <br/>
