Subject: <br/>
<br/>
I just found a book called 'The Uesugi' Samurai Heroes 2 written by<br/>
Martin Jones and Terje Solum published by Dai Sho Publishing (London)<br/>
1995. Its a short work on Uesugi Kenshin. The writer also penned a book<br/>
on Takeda Shingen (Samurai Heroes 1?) and was going to write one on II<br/>
Naomasa. Does anyone have any info on these books and the writer,<br/>
especially where I can find these books. Thanks<br/>
<br/>

All three are available and I have them.<br/>
Each one is progressively better in terms of content and include colour<br/>
sections with Mon.<br/>
That said, all three are excellent.<br/>
<br/>
Two Dragons (who also produce a fine range of 15mm miniatures) are<br/>
involved in the process and will be producing more at a later stage.<br/>
The author also wrote some articles for Wargames Illustrated a number of<br/>
years ago.<br/>
<br/>
There are several sources in the UK who stock these booklets but I am<br/>
not sure if they had web sites (I cannot find a reference anyway).<br/>
<br/>
Unsure about the rest of the world from stocking point of view.<br/>
<br/>
However if you want to drop me a mail off line<br/>
(<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="mailto:rob@...">rob@...</a>) I am sure we can come to some arrangement<br/>
and I can send you the books in exchange for some thing I cannot easily<br/>
get in the UK.<br/>
<br/>
As a point of reference the authors of Killer Katanas wargame rule set<br/>
also produce some similar style booklets and these cover the Mori,<br/>
Shimazu, Date, Tokugawa, Hideyoshi with Hojo to come.<br/>
These have a brief detail of the clan, and features on two battles, with<br/>
(obviously) a focus on replaying the battle using KK rules.<br/>
They are also good value for money even though I do not play the game<br/>
itself. (I do have the rules and more wargames figures than most sane<br/>
people can imagine!)<br/>
<br/>
Hope that helps anyway<br/>
<br/>
Kind regards<br/>
<br/>
