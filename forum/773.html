<h3>Intro/Question</h3>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-2076821402">First of all, I'm Liz and I just joined this group.  I'm doing a <br/>
research paper on samurai and seppuku, and I have a question for you all that <br/>
I'm hoping someone can answer as soon as possible.  The paper is due tomorrow <br/>
and I just realized that I don't have an example for how samurais sometimes <br/>
used seppuku to save others.  If I'm completely off and they never did then I <br/>
can just take it out, but it would help if I had some kind of example so I <br/>
could leave it in.  Please, if anyone has any examples that they could give <br/>
me could you e-mail/IM me?  My e-mail is <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="mailto:kawaiilizard@...">kawaiilizard@...</a> and my AOL/AIM <br/>
name is KawaiiLizard.  Thank you so much for your help in advance!  Also, if <br/>
you don't know of a specific example but you know an easy way to find one on <br/>
a website, I'll take that, too!  Thanks a bunch!<br/>

<br/>
I think you are sailing close to the wind!! You have probably missed you<br/>
assignment date, hope you have an understanding tutor. Not sure where you<br/>
are (time wise!!), but here is a suggestion fo an unusua approach:<br/>
<br/>
I have recently been writing a chapter on "Women of the Samurai" and, of<br/>
course, Gacia Hosokawa features quite strongly. You should assume that the<br/>
suicide was for the "Good of Others", but still not a christian act!!<br/>
Seppuku is rather different for women on the samurai class - but the end<br/>
result is the same.  You can search the WEB and find several sites giving<br/>
information [probably the best approach at this late stage]. This site is<br/>
pretty good for an overall veiwpoint.<br/>

Good luck with the paper....<br/>
