 </span></blockquote>This is about the tenth time in the last two months or so that somebody <br/>
gets in, asks something for a paper, gets info and takes off. While I <br/>
think that most of us takes pride in being capable to help with <br/>
specific issues, I believe that users with a very BASIC question should <br/>
do their homework first, and then come here and ask questions.<br/>
To ask what was a daimyo is a bit like asking what was a European <br/>
feudal lord. It's a VERY generic, broad question, and accordingly there <br/>
is PLENTY of information about it.<br/>
idiotkid43, use google, or GO TO THE LIBRARY of your university, and <br/>
then come back with more specific questions, and perhaps with some <br/>
greetings and signature at the end of your message.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-2107938115">The idea that somebody would be writing a university-level paper on samurai and not know what a daimyo is, or how to easily find out, strikes me as truly, deeply bizarre. If it were a grade-school assignment, or even one from middle school, OK. But *university*?<br/>
<br/>
I'll bet that our 14-year old friend who recently joined the group would have no trouble explaining what a daimyo is.<br/>
