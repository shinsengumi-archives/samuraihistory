A tale of humanity and heroism among the samurai elite <br/>
<br/>
FILM REVIEW <br/>
<br/>
ALLAN HUNTER <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
When The Last Sword Is Drawn (15) <br/>
<br/>
Director: Yojiro Takita <br/>
Starring: Kiichi Nakai <br/>
Running time: 138 minutes <br/>
<br/>
CROUCHING Tiger, Hidden Dragon and Hero are among the films that <br/>
have broken down the resistance of British audiences to foreign-<br/>
language fare. They may also have contributed to an unrealistic view <br/>
of what Asian cinema has to offer. <br/>
<br/>
All pristine, perfectly composed images and eye-catching <br/>
pyrotechnics, they suggest every martial arts film from the Far East <br/>
sets out to dazzle. But unlike those lavish Chinese cinematic <br/>
productions, the Japanese film When The Last Sword Is Drawn is much <br/>
more traditional and has the satisfying sweep and sprawl of a good <br/>
old-fashioned novel - which is hardly surprising given its roots in <br/>
a bestseller by prizewinning author Jiro Asada. <br/>
<br/>
Structured around a series of flashbacks and blending the complex <br/>
social history of 19th century Japan with more universal concerns of <br/>
family, honour and class struggle, it often feels like a Japanese <br/>
equivalent of Dr Zhivago or Gone With The Wind, displaying much in <br/>
common with the cinema of Kurosawa and Oshima. <br/>
<br/>
The tale begins during the winter of 1899. An elderly man called <br/>
Hajime Saito (Koichi Sato) arrives at a clinic seeking help for his <br/>
sick grandson. A doctor offers assistance and Saito spots a photo of <br/>
Kanichiro Yoshimura (Kiichi Nakai), a man he once despised and <br/>
wanted to kill. The doctor (Takehiro Murata) also knew the man and <br/>
his son and their conflicting memories of his true nature provide <br/>
the basis for the story. <br/>
<br/>
In the 1860s, Saito and Yoshimura were both members of the <br/>
celebrated Shinsengumi, an elite force of samurai dedicated to the <br/>
defence of Kyoto. Saito considered himself to possess all the <br/>
virtues of a samurai and thought Yoshimura little more than a <br/>
country bumpkin whose mere presence was an insult to his dignity. <br/>
<br/>
Yoshimura, however, was easily the best swordsman of his generation <br/>
and was also dedicated to his family. He considered indignity a <br/>
small price to pay if he could continue to provide for them. Thus, <br/>
he accepted the jobs others shunned, demanded extra payment for acts <br/>
of bravery and never flaunted his superiority. "What kind of samurai <br/>
is that?" demanded one colleague. <br/>
<br/>
The doctor recalls an entirely different man; a devoted father and <br/>
husband who did whatever was necessary to provide for his family and <br/>
keep them alive. Gradually, as their memories converge, it becomes <br/>
clear just what an extraordinary figure Yoshimura really was. <br/>
<br/>
The personal story at the core of When The Last Sword Is Drawn is <br/>
played out against the shifting allegiances and social changes in <br/>
the Japanese history of the period. Gunfire begins to make the sword <br/>
a weapon of the past. Divisions within the Shinsengumi sow the seeds <br/>
of its eventual destruction. There is an elegiac, end-of-era quality <br/>
that carries echoes of such influential American westerns as The <br/>
Wild Bunch and The Shootist. <br/>
<br/>
Director Yojiro Takita takes an understated approach: the film wears <br/>
its beauty without ostentation. Confrontations are swift, brutal and <br/>
bloody without becoming stylised. The flashbacks occasionally <br/>
threaten to break the spell of the narrative, but what ultimately <br/>
shines through is the humanity of the story as memories and <br/>
incidents transform our understanding of an individual, revealing <br/>
that heroism can take many forms and that even the bitterest rivals <br/>
can eventually achieve mutual respect. <br/>
<br/>
On selected release from Friday<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-713197996">Hey Kitsuno!<br/>
<br/>
That was an interesting review about the movie. I managed to catch it <br/>
for my Japanese history class and it was amazing. To me, no other film <br/>
exhibited the economic and emotional difficulties of the samurai. Truth <br/>
be told, the tale explores more on the life of the lowly samurai hero <br/>
and how reality has forced him to make great changes in his life. I <br/>
cried at the end of this film. I can't help it, it was too sad, yet as <br/>
an educated viewer, I knew that it was the right thing to do.<br/>
<br/>
Other than the review, for those who are interested  to me, this is one <br/>
of the better Samurai movies out there since Akira Kurosawa. For fans of <br/>
the Shinsengumi, they're the group highlighted in this movie. Very <br/>
moving and a rather in-depth perspective of samurai life.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1998019416">On a recommendation I rented "When The Last Sword Is Drawn" this <br/>
weekend, it impressed me so much I bought a copy off E-bay-(The one <br/>
I watched did not have subtitles) I believe it is under it's <br/>
Japanese title "Mibugishiden"<br/>
I also highly recommend "Tasogare Seibei" (Twilight Samurai), I <br/>
think it ws the best film I have seen this year! It really impressed <br/>
me. <br/>
I did not care for "The Last Samurai", I think part of that was Tom <br/>
Cruise. <br/>
