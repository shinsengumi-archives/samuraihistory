<h3>15mm Samurai and Korean Figures</h3>
by <i>burker94509</i>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1342848568">I need to tap into the group's collective knowledge.  What companies make <br/>
15mm figures for Samurai and Koreans for the Japanese invasion of Korea in 1592?<br/>
<br/>
I know that Two  Dragons, Minifigs, Irregular Miniatures, Tin Soldier, and <br/>
Naismith, all have samurai lines. The first three would be compatible with each <br/>
each in terms of size.  Tin Soldier are very large 15s while Naismith are very <br/>
small 15s.<br/>
<br/>
In terms of Koreans, Naismith makes at least 6 different packs of Koreans, <br/>
but I don't know if they are for the Yi Dynasty or for an earlier period.  East <br/>
Riding Miniatures has some Yi Dynasty Koreans, but they only make command <br/>
figures and two types of heavy cavalry (no infantry).<br/>
<br/>
Irregular Miniatures makes some Korean figures as part of the Mongol line, so <br/>
I suspect that they would be too early for the period I am interested in.<br/>
<br/>
Does anyone know of any other manufacturers of 15mm Japanese and Korean <br/>
figures?<br/>
<br/>
Thanks in advance.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1366788326">Dear Bob:<br/>
With regard to the uniforms of Korean infantry<br/>
figures, I presume that the manufacturer did not make<br/>
infantry soldire figures on purpose because regular<br/>
infantry during the Yi dynasty did not have any<br/>
armors. They did not look any warrior figures.<br/>
Also, as far as I know, the reular cavalry did not<br/>
have armors and their uniforms were probabily same as<br/>
those of the infantry.<br/>
<br/>
The reason for not having armors except for commanders<br/>
during the Yi dynasty was that the main tactical units<br/>
of soldiers were archers with complementary cannon<br/>
units but mostly in the Navy. If you had seen movie<br/>
"Brave Heart", you may recall the efficacy of the<br/>
Enlish archers against tough Scottish soldiers armed<br/>
with swords and spears.<br/>
<br/>
Koreans were originally related to Mongols and<br/>
Manchurian at the ancient times. Tradionally, the<br/>
archery had been an important part of arts for the<br/>
nobility. I remember that the Japanese at the ancient<br/>
times also put more emphasis on the archery than on<br/>
the  swordmanship.<br/>
<br/>
Back to your question, if you want to have more<br/>
precise information, you may check the Korean websites<br/>
of Museums. I wish I could give more input. But, as<br/>
you know from my earlier message to you, I am pretty<br/>
tight with finishing my paper, now. Good luck on your<br/>
research.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-936182557">Thanks for your e-mail.  I found a company in Austrialia, Eureka Miniatures, <br/>
that makes 15mm Koreans for this period.  I've also found a website that has <br/>
pictures from the Korean War Memorial Museum.  Interestingly enough, the <br/>
cavalry pictures show the cavalry wearing armour.<br/>
<br/>
Good luck with your paper.<br/>
