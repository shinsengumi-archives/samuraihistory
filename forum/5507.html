Anyone expecting a Kurosawa-like epic, a thrilling action film <br/>
replete with beautifully choreographed - and senselessly bloody - <br/>
sword fights are in for a big disappointment with "The Twilight <br/>
Samurai," the new film by Japanese director Yoji Yamada. There are <br/>
only two short fight sequences in the film - both beautifully <br/>
photographed, but a minor part of the story, which looks at the <br/>
quietly heroic life of a minor samurai. <br/>
 <br/>
     The film is set in the 19th century, as the feudal Edo period <br/>
was giving way to Meiji Restoration. (A knowledge of Japanese <br/>
history is not required for this film.) The days of the samurai are <br/>
slipping away. Duels are forbidden, prowess with the sword doesn't <br/>
command the respect it once did. <br/>
 <br/>
     Seibei Iguchi (Hiroyuki Sanada), a minor clerk for the clan, <br/>
might have had samurai fire in his belly at one point. He trained <br/>
with a samurai master and taught at his school, but he has been <br/>
beaten down by life: caring for his wife during drawn-out death from <br/>
tuberculosis, while dealing with a live-in mother in the grips of <br/>
with what appears to be Alzheimer's - and caring for his two <br/>
daughters. <br/>
 <br/>
     Yet he is not unhappy with the strangely rewarding wreckage of <br/>
his life. He finds it fulfilling and wishes he could live a peaceful <br/>
life as a peasant instead of a poor one as a samurai. The boys at <br/>
the office - a warehouse controlled by the clan, mock Iguchi, <br/>
calling him "Twilight Samurai," because he would rather go home to <br/>
his family than out whoring around with them at the end of the day. <br/>
 <br/>
     The divorce and return of Tomoe (Ria Miyazawa), a childhood <br/>
friend, leads to a confrontation with her violent ex, a high-ranking <br/>
samurai mucky-muck who Iguchi beats senseless - using just a stick. <br/>
This pumps up Iguchi's profile within the organization, although not <br/>
his sense of himself - and his chances to find happiness with Tomoe. <br/>
 <br/>
     Based on the best-selling novel by Shuhei Fujisawa and directed <br/>
by Yamada, the Japanese director best known for his 48-episode "Tora-<br/>
san" series, "Twilight Samurai" is a seemingly ordinary story of <br/>
surprising depth and poignancy - and a film that seems, at heart, at <br/>
least, as much "Unforgiven" as "Crouching Tiger." It plays through <br/>
Sept. 16 at The Screening Room, 82 State St., Newburyport. For film <br/>
times, call 978-462-3456. <br/>
