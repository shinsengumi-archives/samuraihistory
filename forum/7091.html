<div id="ygrps-yiv-530936244">That is the joys of the internet, people will always insult people as long as they believe thay can get away with it. This group can be a very productive and above all interlectual experience. Unfortunatly if like me you make the odd grammatical error you can also be corrected, which can be a little insulting. In all this is a productive group to be a part of and although I havent posted in a while I always enjoy reading the regulars opinions. I myself moderate on a huge gamingg forum and it can be a little frustrating, but all in all this is a cool group as long as we all stay on subject.....<br/>

 </span></blockquote>And the one thing this moderator hates is people who<br/>
hide in the herd. Especially when I've asked, offline,<br/>
for you to list any insults I've directed at you, and<br/>
I've tried, repeatedly, to clarify anything you were<br/>
misreading. And now, I get publicly threatened on the<br/>
list. See below: <br/>
<br/>
Someone who once insult me on the web<br/>

 </span></blockquote>This is very junior high school. I'd think a 36 year<br/>
old would be above that. <br/>
