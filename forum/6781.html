<h3>Osaka Castle</h3>
by <i>g3mneye</i>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-2071884141">Hi there:<br/>
<br/>
I've got a question. I know that after Hideyoshi Toyotomi died in <br/>
1598 his son took command but then quickly lost it to Ieyasu <br/>
Tokugawa. I've learned that Osaka castle, which was Hideyoshi's <br/>
headquarters, was destroyed by Tokugawa. Now my question here is how <br/>
was it destroyed was it burned to the ground? Oh yeah one more thing <br/>
how did Hideyoshi die was he murdered or did he die of natural <br/>
causes?<br/>
<br/>
Thanks everybody,<br/>

The buildings were bombarded by cannon and burned. When Tokugawa took control, he rebuilt the complex on top of the existing walls (so none of the walls you see there today are the Toyotomi originals, although they have excavated some of these).<br/>
Hideyoshi died of natural causes-some sort of illness. Syphillis is a popular theory, which would explain his increasingly bizarre behavior towards the end of his life-but I don't know how much stock to put in that. His notorious countless dalliances with women add more credence to the theory, though.</div>

The castle was rebuilt but it wasn't simply reconstructed.  The outer walls remained the same, but the tenshaku was larger and placed differently to that of the Toyotomi-period Osaka castle.<br/>

That's correct about the tenshaku-it was a different<br/>
color too (black-Toyotomi, white-Tokugawa). The<br/>
Tokugawa one also bit the dust (struck by lighting in<br/>
the 1600's) and didn't get rebuilt until the 1930's. <br/>
However, the outer walls are not the Toyotomi<br/>
originals. The Tokugawa covered the entire complex<br/>
with dirt (building a small mountain on top) and under<br/>
the guidance of Todo Takatora built all new ones. Many<br/>
of the stones have the mon of the lord who was<br/>
responsibile for constructing that section of wall,<br/>
and the Osaka Castle museum actually inspected and<br/>
catalogued EVERY SINGLE STONE!!! in the walls a few<br/>
years back. Why? Seems symbolic more than anything<br/>
else. The old walls were perfectly good. As stated<br/>
earlier, they have conducted excavations and uncovered<br/>
some of the Toyotomi walls.<br/>
Several publications sold at the Osaka-jo museum have<br/>
great diagrams of all this. Gakken also just released<br/>
a new book that recreates the Toyotomi version of the<br/>
citadel with computer graphics. <br/>
