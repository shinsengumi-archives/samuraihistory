<div id="ygrps-yiv-1044995970">Hello Mukuan<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
My information does not disprove that Keijiro Maeda was a nephew of Toshiie<br/>
Maeda, neither does it prove it!<br/>
However, the following may help in your research - remember the custom of<br/>
samurai families of taking different names during their life. Also notice<br/>
the use of the first character in the given name (Toshi)<br/>
<br/>
Toshiie Maeda had at least four sons:<br/>
<br/>
1. Toshinaga [1562-1614(?) ] - had no son (he adopted his younger brother<br/>
Toshitsune to succeed him)<br/>
<br/>
2. Toshitsune [1593 - 1658] - had three sons Mitsutaka, Toshitsugu &<br/>
Toshiharu<br/>
<br/>
3. Toshimasa {or Takamasa}  - was on the wrong side at Sekigahara and was<br/>
disposessed hence no history...<br/>
<br/>
4. Toshitaka  - had son Toshitoyo.<br/>
<br/>
Regards,<br/>
<br/>

<blockquote><span title="ireply"> > disposessed hence no history...<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I have a bit of info to add to that - -  Due to his 'mistake' at the <br/>
battle of Sekigahara - breaking with his older brother and turning <br/>
away a messenger from Ieyasu requesting his participation - he lost <br/>
his holdings, and went to kyoto with his wife, and took the tonsure.  <br/>
He was still around during the battle for Osaka castle, however in <br/>
this case he also remained little more than a bystander, and did not <br/>
participate. <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-914063819">all i could say was he did the honorable thing of turning away Ieyasu's <br/>
messenger...Sekigahara's outcome would have been different had the Western <br/>
armies lords been honorable to their cause...by the way,what mangga is it <br/>
that u people are talking about.</div>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1052445606">Checking my references (English and Japanese) it seems if Toshiie had a<br/>
brother he wasn't important.All the genealogies that I can locate of the Maeda<br/>
family begin with Toshiie.<br/>
    It is not clear if your "Keiji" is the adopted son of Toshiie or is it<br/>
Toshihisa? Keiji may have been the childhood name for one of Toshiie sons or<br/>
he maybe complete fiction, no nephews are mentioned. Needless to say it is<br/>
farfetched to believe that such a character was the lover of the wife of one<br/>
of the most powerful Daimyo ever, to the writers credit if he got caught w/<br/>
Toshiie's wife he would not have lived long and all records of his existence<br/>
would most certainly have been erased.<br/>
<br/>
Kabukimono is deragatory I believe and means a "dandy", a flashy dresser.<br/>
