what if he lost big time and Sweden was occupied ;)<br/>

from Vikings and Irish (old English prayer) It would be hard to point to <br/>
a culture on earth that didn't have wars. May be I should us the term <br/>
civilization (city folk) since there were a few hunter gatherer tribes <br/>
that weren't very warlike.<br/>

NONE of the juicy bits of history are taught in most grade schools.<br/>
<br/>
To keep this on topic, I would contrast and compare the armies of the 30 <br/>
years war with the Sengoku period armies. I would consider Japan to be a <br/>
decent military power until Gustavus introduced fast and mobile <br/>
artillery after which Europe keeps developing its military and Japan <br/>
lies stagnant.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Lion of the North?  No thats more like Karl the 12th.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>

 </span></blockquote>Not in Sweden, they teach it with a fair deal of gore and slaying to<br/>
keep the class intrested.<br/>
But in Highschool, they calm down with the slaying bit, and actually<br/>
tell you about the society in a historical perspective.<br/>
<br/>

 </span></blockquote>I still think you are misstaking him for Karl the 12th.<br/>
<br/>
Fantastic Fact: Sweden is the only country in the world (to my<br/>
knowledge) that has actually managed to conqer Russia, and Moscow. The<br/>
russians were kinda cool about and said that If you put the Crownprins<br/>
in Moscow, we will let you stay, and you have two weeks to comply. We<br/>
didnt. They threw us out. So for two weeks, the russian emoire was a<br/>
part of Sweden.<br/>
<br/>
The Japanese military didnt evolv at all untill the meji revolution.<br/>
Kinda stagnant for 400 years...<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-238151110">Why did the Mongols attempt to invade Japan twice in the<br/>
thirteenth century? Why did they invade anywhere? Why does<br/>
anyone? Resources, imperialism, recognition as a dominant<br/>
race were all factors.  Prior to the two assaults, the<br/>
Mongols had dispatched ambassadors to the Bakufu,<br/>
requesting/demanding the submission of the Japanese to a<br/>
position of inferiority, both of which were rather harshly<br/>
manhandled. When diplomatic bullying failed, the Mongols<br/>
decided fatefully to put their fleets into action.<br/>
