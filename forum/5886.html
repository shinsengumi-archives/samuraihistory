<div id="ygrps-yiv-2065945647">hello everyone,<br/>
  i was wondering if anyone could tell me what clothe material was used on the KOTE of samurai armour. The KOTE has all of these lames, mail, and plates on it, but what kind of material are these connected to?,and How do you attach all of the plates,mail, & lames to it??? I've been useing the website www.sengokudaimyo.com as a guide to making my own authentic samurai armour but some of the chapters don't tell me everything i need.(like what certain fabric or materials are needed) Keep in mind, it is the best website i've found about making samurai armour yet, but some of the small important details needed arn't included. If anyone can help, please do so. Also, if anyone knows any great websites or books on THE PROCESSES & THE MATERIALS NEEDED to make samurai armour, please let me know. Thank you for your time.<br/>

  The backing materials (ieji) varied a bit. Usually the middle layer was <br/>
hemp soaked in a waterproofing/stiffener/(insect proofing?) made from unripe <br/>
persimmons. The outer shell in higher quality sets was silk, often a <br/>
brocade, sometimes imported. Lower grade armours especially in the sengoku <br/>
jidai often had a hemp outer shell. The inner shell was either hemp or silk. <br/>
All of this was edged in supple deerhide (usually black).<br/>

<h3>please help about samurai armour - a long reply</h3>
by <i>deanwayland</i>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-583380673">Hi,<br/>
<br/>
Michael, has already mentioned the structure for the foundation fabric,<br/>
but as to the technique for attaching the plates and mail for kote etc.,<br/>
it can be done as follows:<br/>
<br/>
1. Firstly make up all the platework and use the mail (kusari) to join<br/>
up all the parts, paint it (don't forget to under-coat it). <br/>
<br/>
BTW As a guide the mail is very fine, meaning the holes in the plates<br/>
are about 1/4" or 7mm centre to centre and about 1.2 in diameter. The<br/>
round "rings" that lay flat should be made of about 0.8-1.0 mm wire,<br/>
while the oval "links" that stand on their long edges should be thinner<br/>
at around 0.6-0.9mm. The diameter for the mandrel around which you wrap<br/>
your wire, should be about 3-4mm. You can make the oval rings by taking<br/>
the uncut coil of round rings and squeezing them to shape in a vice,<br/>
then cut them off as per normal. This kusari is comparatively weak along<br/>
side European mail, but it isn't required to be structurally sound, as<br/>
its job is to stop sharp things slicing bits of you off, which as it is<br/>
supported by the textiles beneath, it does very well indeed!<br/>
<br/>
2. Ideally make up a simple wooden "picture" style frame, to which you<br/>
can pin the fabric, to hold it firmly in place, while letting you work<br/>
on it from either side. This frame is invaluable.<br/>
<br/>
3. Now lay your middle layer of hemp over the frame, and then cover that<br/>
with your chosen outer shell, now pin them to the frame. If you can't<br/>
get hemp or indeed afford it, use corse linen. Do NOT put the inner<br/>
shell in position yet, nor should you cut it to shape. <br/>
<br/>
4. Lay your metal work on the section in the middle, and use a few pins<br/>
to initially hold it in place.<br/>
<br/>
5. Okay, now we start sewing. Don't panic, you do not need to sew every<br/>
piece down with a separate set of stitching, the old armourers were very<br/>
cunning, particularly when it came to mass production. Use a simple<br/>
running stitch around the outside edges, so that on the plates you end<br/>
up with alternate little 7mm sections of thread with blank space in<br/>
between. And to secure the mail, just take your needle from the back to<br/>
the front, and go around that edge of the oval "link" that's lying<br/>
against the fabric and back through your cloth. In effect you are<br/>
creating little loops to hold the mail in place. Do NOT sew the round<br/>
"rings" down, this will pull the armour in too tight making it sort of<br/>
shrink and become stiffer, not a good idea, as we found out, we had to<br/>
sew one kote twice:-(<br/>
<br/>
BTW we had to do another twice because the chap used white linen thread<br/>
on black armour, laid upon a dark blue foundation. We swapped it for<br/>
black linen, as it looked much better, so choose your thread wisely.<br/>
<br/>
6. Around the elbow section, where there is often lots of mail, but few<br/>
plates (an elbow cap and maybe up to five tiny semi-circular plates in<br/>
orbit around it), and assuming you've sewn the edges as stated in "5"<br/>
above, just sew the links around the plates themselves, put in a running<br/>
stitch across the middle of the solid panel of mail, let the rest float<br/>
free for ease of movement. If you go for the style of open work mail on<br/>
the inside of the elbow, you'll need to go around the "links" of each<br/>
open section to stop it from flapping about.<br/>
<br/>
7. Now comes the trick. With all these running stitches you would think<br/>
one breakage and your armour will fall off! Not so, turn the armour over<br/>
so you are looking at the inside and all those vunrible threads. You<br/>
then give it a wipe over with thin glue. I believe the Japanese used a<br/>
glue made from rice paste or possibly a fish based one (Tony, Michael?).<br/>
When it dries, the armour will be very stiff, but after a very, very<br/>
short while, it'll loosen up. The idea is that if a thread breaks then<br/>
its prevented from unravelling by the glue, thus saving you hours and<br/>
hours of unnecessary sewing:-)<br/>
<br/>
8. At this point you'll probably want to touch up the paint work before<br/>
taking it off the frame for shaping.<br/>
<br/>
9. Pin your inner shell to the armour and cut it to shape (sorry I would<br/>
need lots of pictures here to show you how, refer to Tony's pages for<br/>
guidance). Having got it to the right shape take the inner shell off<br/>
again and put it aside for the time being.<br/>
<br/>
10. Get some very very thin leather. Ideally you should use the kind of<br/>
Japanese leather made for the task, as it is not only thin, but has<br/>
little or no stretchiness. Cut it in to a long narrow strip about 20mm<br/>
across. If it has a stencilled pattern on it you will need to start<br/>
sewing it to the edge with its outside face flat against the outside of<br/>
the kote fabric, so you are seeing its reverse side. Put its edge in<br/>
line with the edge of the kote, so it lays inboard of the edge. Now sew<br/>
along the outside edge. <br/>
<br/>
11. Put in any ties or toggles (kohaze) etc that you need at this point.<br/>
But not the cord that closes the kote into a tube shape.<br/>
<br/>
12. Take your inner shell place it against the inside of your kote, and<br/>
fold the leather trim over itself and around the back of the inside of<br/>
the kote. By doing this you hide the stitching that holds the leather in<br/>
place and reveals the stencilled pattern of the leather (if it has one).<br/>
Now, sew through the front of the kote and the leather (on the back) as<br/>
close to the leather as you can get. Don't use tiny stitches, use big<br/>
ones 1/4"-3/8"(7-10mm). The idea being that when you've finished there<br/>
should be little exposed stitching that can be caught as you put your<br/>
arm in and out, while at the same time leaving it easy to open the kote<br/>
up to do repairs. If you want to be a bit classy you can apply a 1/8th<br/>
(3mm) herring bone patterned braid up against the edge of the leather,<br/>
making the stitching practically invisible.<br/>
<br/>
13. Finally put in the cords that hold the kote shut, again refer to<br/>
Tony's pages.<br/>
<br/>
Although not cheap, for Japanese leather, silk braid etc. see Trevor's<br/>
restoration pages at:<br/>

<br/>
BTW Tony, I've no idea if you cover all of this stuff on your pages, but<br/>
as I needed to write this up for myself, I thought I'd use the<br/>
opportunity, and then share it.<br/>
<br/>
Anyway, hope this is useful<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-807338347">hi,<br/>
  Thank you very much for this info. I'm gonna try it out asap. Do you know how to make a full suit of samurai armor? if so, do you have any pics? Anything to help me would be great. Also, in your step 9 below, you said that you would need lots of pics to show me how to put it all together. Well, i was thinking that the next time you made samurai armor, you could catalog the process for me.(detailed pics and notes). I'm not asking you to do it for me for free if that's what your thinking. I'll gladly $pay$ you for your time.(for the pics & notes). I know it might be asking a bit much but if your interested please let me know. I really want to make samurai armor but i'm affraid of screwing it all up cause i don't have a lot of info on how to make it. All i got is a lot of pics of full-scale size armor and not a lot of detailed pics on how it all goes together. Well, like i said if your interested let me know,....please be interested. Thanks again,<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-893718973">Hi Mark<br/>
<br/>
Eep!<br/>
<br/>
I'm so sorry, if I had the time I certainly would help, but sadly I'm<br/>
not that lucky. I haven't done much building myself, my eyesight is<br/>
really bad but I did lead a project to make an armour, for one of my<br/>
friends. As I said in my reply, I was taking the opportunity to get some<br/>
of the data down on paper:-) My intention is, to get a few of the<br/>
pictures of our "work in progress" posted to my web site, with a short<br/>
explanation. When I do I'll post the news here.<br/>
<br/>
Meanwhile, to give you an idea of what you could be letting yourself in<br/>
for: I started researching back in 1986, started seriously sorting out<br/>
the building in 1994 and we still haven't finished the dam thing yet! In<br/>
the end we more or less gave up, until last year, when we got our butts<br/>
off the deck and knuckled down to doing some more research and work<br/>
(that awful little four letter word). All the parts we had half done<br/>
were finished, and we started to look around for a decent smith who<br/>
could make the other parts for us instead, otherwise Andrew, the friend<br/>
in question will be long in his grave by the time we actually finish it! <br/>
<br/>
For myself, earlier this year I gave in and bought a Japanese festival<br/>
armour as a sort of stop-gap, I was sick of the great theoretical<br/>
armour, I wanted the real thing, well I got it, er.. sort of. The<br/>
replica in question is way under weight and needs a lot of work, just to<br/>
make it serviceable, but a whole lot less than starting from scratch.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-2080461610">Hi Dean,<br/>
 Thank you very much for replying. Sucks you don't have time. I have my first child coming in 1-2 weeks so i'll probably understand what you mean. Oh well, i thought i'd ask anyways. (you sure,...???? $$$$$$) Let's keep it at that for now, but if you change your mind u have my e-mail. Back to that first e-mail u sent me about stitching the armor to the fabrics...,...a couple more ?'s then i'll stop bothering u for advice.<br/>
 <br/>
 1. So in actuallity, there are 4 layers of clothe? Outer Layer(that's what you see on the outsite), a layer of Cloth Hemp?(goes under outer layer)where can a get that?what size?, a layer of Very Very Very Thin Leather(goes under hemp layer), and then the Inner Shell(goes under v v v thin leather)?is this layer leather? do i harden the leather?if so do i boil it and then mold it to fit my arm? or does it stretch the whole way down the entire KOTE and stay flexable?<br/>
 <br/>
2. I understand stitching the mail down but about the plates.. How do sew them down. You talked about a "running stitch"???what's that? i'm not a sewer. Do a sew through the metal? Do i predrill little holes?? I don't understand that part. <br/>
 <br/>
3. How do you put a running stitch across the middle of a solid panal of mail? <br/>
 <br/>
4. Different topic. Do you have any instructions on how to lace lames together????? I just can't seem to get it right. My armor is all flimsy and isn't very rigid. My Lames are about 1.5" wide x 2.5" high 10gauge stainless steal.(free from work) I need to learn some better methods on lacing them together. I don't think i have enough hole punch in each lame? Website's don't really go into detail on putting more than 2 lames together.(that sucks) Anyway, if you have a good technique on lacing Lame armor, please let me know.<br/>
 <br/>
                               Thanks for everything Dean,<br/>

Eep!<br/>
<br/>
I'm so sorry, if I had the time I certainly would help, but sadly I'm<br/>
not that lucky. I haven't done much building myself, my eyesight is<br/>
really bad but I did lead a project to make an armour, for one of my<br/>
friends. As I said in my reply, I was taking the opportunity to get some<br/>
of the data down on paper:-) My intention is, to get a few of the<br/>
pictures of our "work in progress" posted to my web site, with a short<br/>
explanation. When I do I'll post the news here.<br/>
<br/>
Meanwhile, to give you an idea of what you could be letting yourself in<br/>
for: I started researching back in 1986, started seriously sorting out<br/>
the building in 1994 and we still haven't finished the dam thing yet! In<br/>
the end we more or less gave up, until last year, when we got our butts<br/>
off the deck and knuckled down to doing some more research and work<br/>
(that awful little four letter word). All the parts we had half done<br/>
were finished, and we started to look around for a decent smith who<br/>
could make the other parts for us instead, otherwise Andrew, the friend<br/>
in question will be long in his grave by the time we actually finish it! <br/>
<br/>
For myself, earlier this year I gave in and bought a Japanese festival<br/>
armour as a sort of stop-gap, I was sick of the great theoretical<br/>
armour, I wanted the real thing, well I got it, er.. sort of. The<br/>

some of the info you need is on www.sengokudaimyo.com<br/>

this site is one for making toy version a (full size)<br/>

The template for the koe is quite good but you may<br/>
need to alter it. I would suggest that you make it too<br/>
bit then start cutting down.<br/>
<br/>
I have been reading thris thred with interest as I<br/>
have been slowly working on some pices myself.If you<br/>
are going to make Japanese armour, you really can not<br/>
do it from ready books and looking at photos. You are<br/>
going to have to do what anyoe else has done, thats<br/>
get to a museum and view as many sets as possible. If<br/>
you write in advance and talk with the muesum they<br/>
wiill take you into the displays and also to the store<br/>
rooms where I bet that have extra pieces. I handled at<br/>
least 20 sets of kote before I attempted mine. the<br/>
first sleeve took me one month doing an hour or so<br/>
every day. that included making all my own rings etc.<br/>

you need to handle the mail and the plates to see how<br/>
its constructed.<br/>
<br/>
I was very lucky to have Ian Bottomley show me mail<br/>
and also draw diagrams for me on how to make it.<br/>
<br/>
go for it its great fun, but you must handle the real<br/>
things first<br/>

Hi Dean,<br/>
 Thank you very much for replying. Sucks you don't<br/>
have time. I have my first child coming in 1-2 weeks<br/>
so i'll probably understand what you mean. Oh well, i<br/>
thought i'd ask anyways. (you sure,...???? $$$$$$)<br/>
Let's keep it at that for now, but if you change your<br/>
mind u have my e-mail. Back to that first e-mail u<br/>
sent me about stitching the armor to the<br/>
fabrics...,...a couple more ?'s then i'll stop<br/>
bothering u for advice.<br/>
 <br/>
 1. So in actuallity, there are 4 layers of clothe?<br/>
Outer Layer(that's what you see on the outsite), a<br/>
layer of Cloth Hemp?(goes under outer layer)where can<br/>
a get that?what size?, a layer of Very Very Very Thin<br/>
Leather(goes under hemp layer), and then the Inner<br/>
Shell(goes under v v v thin leather)?is this layer<br/>
leather? do i harden the leather?if so do i boil it<br/>
and then mold it to fit my arm? or does it stretch the<br/>
whole way down the entire KOTE and stay flexable?<br/>
 <br/>
2. I understand stitching the mail down but about the<br/>
plates.. How do sew them down. You talked about a<br/>
"running stitch"???what's that? i'm not a sewer. Do a<br/>
sew through the metal? Do i predrill little holes?? I<br/>
don't understand that part. <br/>
 <br/>
3. How do you put a running stitch across the middle<br/>
of a solid panal of mail? <br/>
 <br/>
4. Different topic. Do you have any instructions on<br/>
how to lace lames together????? I just can't seem to<br/>
get it right. My armor is all flimsy and isn't very<br/>
rigid. My Lames are about 1.5" wide x 2.5" high<br/>
10gauge stainless steal.(free from work) I need to<br/>
learn some better methods on lacing them together. I<br/>
don't think i have enough hole punch in each lame?<br/>
Website's don't really go into detail on putting more<br/>
than 2 lames together.(that sucks) Anyway, if you have<br/>
a good technique on lacing Lame armor, please let me<br/>
know.<br/>
 <br/>
                               Thanks for everything<br/>

Hi Mark<br/>
<br/>
Eep!<br/>
<br/>
I'm so sorry, if I had the time I certainly would<br/>
help, but sadly I'm<br/>
not that lucky. I haven't done much building myself,<br/>
my eyesight is<br/>
really bad but I did lead a project to make an armour,<br/>
for one of my<br/>
friends. As I said in my reply, I was taking the<br/>
opportunity to get some<br/>
of the data down on paper:-) My intention is, to get a<br/>
few of the<br/>
pictures of our "work in progress" posted to my web<br/>
site, with a short<br/>
explanation. When I do I'll post the news here.<br/>
<br/>
Meanwhile, to give you an idea of what you could be<br/>
letting yourself in<br/>
for: I started researching back in 1986, started<br/>
seriously sorting out<br/>
the building in 1994 and we still haven't finished the<br/>
dam thing yet! In<br/>
the end we more or less gave up, until last year, when<br/>
we got our butts<br/>
off the deck and knuckled down to doing some more<br/>
research and work<br/>
(that awful little four letter word). All the parts we<br/>
had half done<br/>
were finished, and we started to look around for a<br/>
decent smith who<br/>
could make the other parts for us instead, otherwise<br/>
Andrew, the friend<br/>
in question will be long in his grave by the time we<br/>
actually finish it! <br/>
<br/>
For myself, earlier this year I gave in and bought a<br/>
Japanese festival<br/>
armour as a sort of stop-gap, I was sick of the great<br/>
theoretical<br/>
armour, I wanted the real thing, well I got it, er..<br/>
sort of. The<br/>
replica in question is way under weight and needs a<br/>
lot of work, just to<br/>
make it serviceable, but a whole lot less than<br/>
starting from scratch.<br/>
But I do intend to replace it with something much<br/>
better.<br/>
<br/>
The problem was we started with the idea of doing it<br/>
as right as<br/>
possible, but of necessity we had to make compromises<br/>
as we went along,<br/>
which no doubt you will probably have to do as well.<br/>
For example we<br/>
didn't use urushi (Japanese lacquer), due to its cost<br/>
and toxicity. And<br/>
when we did the kote (armoured sleeve), kohire<br/>
("little-fin" brigendine<br/>
shoulder guards) and the tate-eri ("shield-collar") we<br/>
had to use<br/>
American doe skin as we couldn't get the right thing<br/>
from Japan. Now, we<br/>
can and the guys who did the sewing are cursing a lot<br/>
as they know that<br/>
I'm going to "persuade" them to replace it. The dou<br/>
(body armour) we had<br/>
made is in russet 2mm steel and does look amazing, but<br/>
it doesn't have<br/>
any gessan yet, but I hope to have that sorted out<br/>
sometime soon, as<br/>
Michael who answered your first email does make armour<br/>
in his spare time<br/>
(spare time? a misnomer I think, would you not agree<br/>
Michael?).<br/>
<br/>
Anyway I wish you the best of luck, I'm sorry I can't<br/>
currently be of<br/>
more help, but as soon as I've got the stuff up on the<br/>
net I'll let you<br/>
know.<br/>
<br/>
All the best<br/>
<br/>
Yours<br/>
<br/>
Dean<br/>

I couldn't agree more, Ian did the same for us. We were lucky enough to<br/>
have access to the Wade collection (Snowshill Manor) several years ago<br/>
('95-'96), and we'd stay over in the Manor for week-ends on the trot,<br/>
studying, sketching and pulling our hair out, but it was worth it. Plus<br/>
Ian spent a day with us there explaining everything, in collaboration<br/>
with Mike Jessop the then curator. Sadly the collection is currently not<br/>
on display as they are doing a lot of refurbishment to the building and<br/>
no one has any idea what's going to happen to the arms and armour. <br/>
<br/>
BTW for those of you who have a copy of Ian and Jock's book "Arms and<br/>
Armour of the Samurai", the two-page picture just before the title page<br/>
was taken in the then "Green" room at Snowshill, an amazing collection.<br/>
<br/>
Mark, to re-enforce what Paul says, there is NO substitute for getting<br/>
your hands on real armour, so get yourself off to a museum with a<br/>
collection, contact the curator and tell him/her what you're doing and<br/>
ask to have a hands on introduction. Don't be too disappointed if you<br/>
have to try several, or if they restrict what you can see or handle.<br/>
This is only to be expected with stuff that is quite often delicate. The<br/>
other places to visit include arms fairs, where this stuff is up for<br/>
sale, I spent many a happy hour or six wandering around learning as I<br/>
went. Finally if you can afford it, one technique is to buy bits of the<br/>
real thing, study it, then sell it on and buy something else, repeat<br/>
until happy, broke or both.<br/>
<br/>
Yours<br/>
<br/>
Dean<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1423528493">Hi Mark,<br/>
<br/>
Okay, to really answer your questions I'd have to write a book, and a<br/>
pretty big one at that, and there is no way that I'm adequately<br/>
qualified to even think about it, never mind the fact that as I said<br/>
time is short, and your right that "sucks".<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> >    Thank you very much for replying. Sucks you don't have time. I have <br/>
>    my first child coming in 1-2 weeks so i'll probably understand what <br/>
>    you mean.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Oh yeah, you definitely will....<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> > Oh well, i thought i'd ask anyways. (you sure,...???? <br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>h yeah, I'm sure...<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> >    $$$$$$) Let's keep it at that for now, but if you change your mind <br/>
>    u have my e-mail.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I have...<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> > Back to that first e-mail u sent me about <br/>
>    stitching the armor to the fabrics...,...a couple more ?'s then <br/>
>    i'll stop bothering u for advice.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>So folks, I'm a sucker...<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> >    1. So in actuallity, there are 4 layers of clothe?<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>NO, just 3...<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> > Outer <br/>
>    Layer(that's what you see on the outsite),<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Yep...<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> > a layer of Cloth <br/>
>    Hemp?(goes under outer layer)where can a get that?what size?,<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Yep, and don't worry about trying to get hemp, its expensive, use<br/>
"linen",  which is made from the "flax" plant, or just a corse weave<br/>
cotton, almost like a sort of fine heavy sack cloth. Go chat with a<br/>
cloth merchant...<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> > a <br/>
>    layer of Very Very Very Thin Leather(goes under hemp layer),<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Er... no, the thin leather is the edge trim not a layer...<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> > and <br/>
>    then the Inner Shell<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Yep..<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> >(goes under v v v thin leather)?<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>no, see above..<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> >is this layer <br/>
>    leather?<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>no, this inner shell should be a soft linen, cotton or rarely silk, it<br/>
has to be comfortable as it goes directly against your bear skin...<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> > do i harden the leather?if so do i boil it and then mold <br/>
>    it to fit my arm? or does it stretch the whole way down the entire <br/>
>    KOTE and stay flexable?<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>as I said no leather layer, it goes on the edge only, and if you boil<br/>
leather, you get soup..<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> >    2. I understand stitching the mail down but about the plates.. How <br/>
>    do sew them down. <br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>All the plates on kote etc, have holes around their edges through which<br/>
either the links of the mail pass, or where there is no mail, you use<br/>
thread to sew it down...<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> >You talked about a "running stitch"???what's <br/>
>    that? i'm not a sewer.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Well there's another skill you'll need to learn to become a "Japanese"<br/>
armourer, ask someone you know who sews, or visit your local library and<br/>
get a book on sewing for beginners...<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> > Do a sew through the metal? Do i predrill <br/>
>    little holes??<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Yes, as I described above...<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> > I don't understand that part. <br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Good point, this is why I agree with Paul, go get your hands on the<br/>
"real" thing, it will all become clear, especially if you can find<br/>
someone who'll talk you through it while you have the armour in your<br/>
hands...<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> >    3. How do you put a running stitch across the middle of a solid <br/>
>    panal of mail? <br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>When I say "solid" I meant, composed of just mail, no plates, no big<br/>
gaps. The word "Mail" comes from Latin via medieval French, and it can<br/>
be translated as "net" or "mesh", its full of holes and you simply take<br/>
your thread and loop it round a bit of the mail "tying" it to the cloth.<br/>
It'll become obvious when you see a real kote up close.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> >    4. Different topic. Do you have any instructions on how to lace <br/>

>    if you have a good technique on lacing Lame armor, please let me <br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Again, I feel a major work coming on, sorry, go look at the real thing.<br/>
Also try getting hold of a book entitled:<br/>
<br/>
"The Manufacture of Helmets and Armour in 16th Century Japan" by<br/>
Sekikabara Kozan translated by H.R.Robinson, and look at the diagrams in<br/>
the back...<br/>
<br/>
And finally, re your other email, as to tools, again I suggest find<br/>
yourself a friendly local armourer and get their advice. Tony's website,<br/>
which Paul has given you will help you if you can't find someone to talk<br/>
to.<br/>
<br/>
Anyway, I'm off to do all the other things that I'm supposed to be<br/>
doing, good luck with your project.<br/>

<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1271398206">Hello again,<br/>
  I just want to thank you guys(Dean & Paul) for the great advice. I really appreciate you guys taking some time out and explaining all of this stuff to me. I might sound stupid, but, i never even thought of going to a museum to see armor. That's a great idea!!! Again, thanks a lot for all of the advice. I'll post some pics up as i go along. Hope to hear some good replies about it. Thank you.<br/>
                                                            Greatfully yours,<br/>
                                                              Mark<br/>
 <br/>
P.S.- do you guys ever go to any of the SCA events? I live in Buffalo N.Y. so if you go to any in Rochester N.Y. or most other cities in N.Y.,i might see ya there.<br/>
 <br/>
                         Later Guys!!!!!<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1101180109">HI<br/>
<br/>
I live inthe Uk and have never seen the SCA. <br/>
<br/>
I do a martial art that has a section for fighting in<br/>
armour. I now have a paul chen armour which I use for<br/>
bashing about in.<br/>
<br/>
I started to dabble in simple armour making so I could<br/>
understand how the stuff worked etc. I have never<br/>
finished a set yet, I just have a go at bits and<br/>
pieces, never made anything yet of outstanding<br/>
quality. For good stuff in the USA you need to speak<br/>
with Anthony Bryant as he has had some really training<br/>
compared to some of us working from his notes and<br/>
making feable attempts.<br/>
<br/>
Milwaukee public museum has about 11 sets of which I<br/>
htink 7 are on display (were last time I was there)<br/>
all of which are in excellent condition. They are<br/>
really good there and let me look at everything in the<br/>
stores and photo as much as I wanted. Shame was no one<br/>
there knows a thing about the stuff.<br/>

  I just want to thank you guys(Dean & Paul) for the<br/>
great advice. I really appreciate you guys taking some<br/>
time out and explaining all of this stuff to me. I<br/>
might sound stupid, but, i never even thought of going<br/>
to a museum to see armor. That's a great idea!!!<br/>
Again, thanks a lot for all of the advice. I'll post<br/>
some pics up as i go along. Hope to hear some good<br/>
replies about it. Thank you.<br/>
                                                      <br/>
     Greatfully yours,<br/>
                                                      <br/>
       Mark<br/>
 <br/>
P.S.- do you guys ever go to any of the SCA events? I<br/>
live in Buffalo N.Y. so if you go to any in Rochester<br/>
N.Y. or most other cities in N.Y.,i might see ya<br/>
there.<br/>
 <br/>
                         Later Guys!!!!!<br/>

Hi Mark,<br/>
<br/>
Okay, to really answer your questions I'd have to<br/>
write a book, and a<br/>
pretty big one at that, and there is no way that I'm<br/>
adequately<br/>
qualified to even think about it, never mind the fact<br/>
that as I said<br/>
time is short, and your right that "sucks".<br/>
<br/>

<br/>

 </span></blockquote>sure,...???? <br/>
<br/>
h yeah, I'm sure...<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> >    $$$$$$) Let's keep it at that for now, but if you<br/>
 </span></blockquote>change your mind <br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> >    u have my e-mail.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I have...<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> > Back to that first e-mail u sent me about <br/>

 </span></blockquote>more ?'s then <br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> >    i'll stop bothering u for advice.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>So folks, I'm a sucker...<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> >    1. So in actuallity, there are 4 layers of<br/>
 </span></blockquote>clothe?<br/>
<br/>
NO, just 3...<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> > Outer <br/>
>    Layer(that's what you see on the outsite),<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Yep...<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> > a layer of Cloth <br/>
>    Hemp?(goes under outer layer)where can a get<br/>
 </span></blockquote>that?what size?,<br/>
<br/>
Yep, and don't worry about trying to get hemp, its<br/>
expensive, use<br/>
"linen",  which is made from the "flax" plant, or just<br/>
a corse weave<br/>
cotton, almost like a sort of fine heavy sack cloth.<br/>
Go chat with a<br/>
cloth merchant...<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> > a <br/>
>    layer of Very Very Very Thin Leather(goes under<br/>
 </span></blockquote>hemp layer),<br/>
<br/>
Er... no, the thin leather is the edge trim not a<br/>
layer...<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> > and <br/>
>    then the Inner Shell<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Yep..<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> >(goes under v v v thin leather)?<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>no, see above..<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> >is this layer <br/>
>    leather?<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>no, this inner shell should be a soft linen, cotton or<br/>
rarely silk, it<br/>
has to be comfortable as it goes directly against your<br/>
bear skin...<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> > do i harden the leather?if so do i boil it and then<br/>
 </span></blockquote>mold <br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> >    it to fit my arm? or does it stretch the whole<br/>
 </span></blockquote>way down the entire <br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> >    KOTE and stay flexable?<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>as I said no leather layer, it goes on the edge only,<br/>
and if you boil<br/>
leather, you get soup..<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> >    2. I understand stitching the mail down but about<br/>
 </span></blockquote>the plates.. How <br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> >    do sew them down. <br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>All the plates on kote etc, have holes around their<br/>
edges through which<br/>
either the links of the mail pass, or where there is<br/>
no mail, you use<br/>
thread to sew it down...<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> >You talked about a "running stitch"???what's <br/>
>    that? i'm not a sewer.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Well there's another skill you'll need to learn to<br/>
become a "Japanese"<br/>
armourer, ask someone you know who sews, or visit your<br/>
local library and<br/>
get a book on sewing for beginners...<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> > Do a sew through the metal? Do i predrill <br/>
>    little holes??<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Yes, as I described above...<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> > I don't understand that part. <br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Good point, this is why I agree with Paul, go get your<br/>
hands on the<br/>
"real" thing, it will all become clear, especially if<br/>
you can find<br/>
someone who'll talk you through it while you have the<br/>
armour in your<br/>
hands...<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> >    3. How do you put a running stitch across the<br/>
 </span></blockquote>middle of a solid <br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> >    panal of mail? <br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>When I say "solid" I meant, composed of just mail, no<br/>
plates, no big<br/>
gaps. The word "Mail" comes from Latin via medieval<br/>
French, and it can<br/>
be translated as "net" or "mesh", its full of holes<br/>
and you simply take<br/>
your thread and loop it round a bit of the mail<br/>
"tying" it to the cloth.<br/>
It'll become obvious when you see a real kote up<br/>
close.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> >    4. Different topic. Do you have any instructions<br/>
 </span></blockquote>on how to lace <br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> >    lames together????? I just can't seem to get it<br/>
 </span></blockquote>right. My armor is <br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> >    all flimsy and isn't very rigid. My Lames are<br/>
 </span></blockquote>about 1.5" wide x <br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> >    2.5" high 10gauge stainless steal.(free from<br/>
 </span></blockquote>work) I need to learn <br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> >    some better methods on lacing them together. I<br/>
 </span></blockquote>don't think i have <br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> >    enough hole punch in each lame? Website's don't<br/>
 </span></blockquote>really go into <br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> >    detail on putting more than 2 lames<br/>
 </span></blockquote>together.(that sucks) Anyway, <br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> >    if you have a good technique on lacing Lame<br/>
 </span></blockquote>armor, please let me <br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> >    know.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Again, I feel a major work coming on, sorry, go look<br/>
at the real thing.<br/>
Also try getting hold of a book entitled:<br/>
<br/>
"The Manufacture of Helmets and Armour in 16th Century<br/>
Japan" by<br/>
Sekikabara Kozan translated by H.R.Robinson, and look<br/>
at the diagrams in<br/>
the back...<br/>
<br/>
And finally, re your other email, as to tools, again I<br/>
suggest find<br/>
yourself a friendly local armourer and get their<br/>
advice. Tony's website,<br/>
which Paul has given you will help you if you can't<br/>
find someone to talk<br/>
to.<br/>
<br/>
Anyway, I'm off to do all the other things that I'm<br/>
supposed to be<br/>
doing, good luck with your project.<br/>
<br/>
Yours<br/>
<br/>
