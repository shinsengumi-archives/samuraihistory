<h3>HELP - Biographies</h3>
by <i>cepooooo</i>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-722340391">I was noticing there are very few biographies of the major Japanese <br/>
(medieval) historical characters in English.<br/>
<br/>
Can you confirm???<br/>
<br/>
I have found:<br/>
<br/>
Hideyoshi (1983, Berry; an older one by Dening, 1888)<br/>
Nobunaga (2001, printed in Holland, limited)<br/>
Ieyasu (1937, Sadler)<br/>
Ashikaga Yoshimasa (2003, Keene)<br/>
Ashikaga Yoshimitsu (never published, as far as I know)<br/>
Taira no Kiyomori 							( " )<br/>
Takeda Shingen 					( " )<br/>
...<br/>
There was one on Yoritomo, but I can't remember...<br/>
<br/>
can you confirm the above? Do you know of any other...?<br/>
thanks!<br/>

<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1277410618">There was a sort of bio on Yoritomo by Jeffery P Mass called "Yoritomo and<br/>
the founding of the first Bakufu".<br/>
<br/>
Conrad Totman also wrote a bio on Tokugawa Ieyasu.<br/>
<br/>
"Kenmu: Go-Daigos Revolution" by Andrew Goble is about Go-Daigo Tenno (not<br/>
strictly bio though)<br/>
<br/>
"Two Japanese Christian Heroes" by Johannes Laures SJ covers Takayama Ukon<br/>
and Hosokawa Gracia<br/>
<br/>
A rather odd book I did come across was "Reflections on the Life and Times<br/>
of  Motonari Mori" by Dr. Shimizu Usui. He is a medical doctor and the book<br/>
is mostly about the medical conditions of the sengoku bushi.<br/>
<br/>
I heard that Jeffrey Kurashige is working on a bio of Takeda Shingen.<br/>
<br/>
There is a very old article on Date Masamune in TASJ from the 1890s (vol 21<br/>
pp 1-105.)<br/>
<br/>
By the way I am reading Keene's book on Yoshimasa right now. I wish someone<br/>
would write a bio on Nobunaga the size and scope of his work on Meiji tenno.</div>
