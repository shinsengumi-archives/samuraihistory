<h3>Travel to Acre, and contact with indigenous isolates</h3>
by <i>monarquista</i>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1503530201">Mr. Tamazato Jean, emissary of the group Monarquia21 will visit Acre (Amazon zone) in august 2010, where he will make contact with leaders in the region. The envoy should also visit indigenous villages. Just over two years, unknown people or isolates that refuse contact with civilization were recorded for the first time.<br/>
<br/>
Mr. Tamazato (son of japanese) believes in the theory that Indian Americans are descendants of Asians. "I'll find friends with the same physical appearance and who are in America for thousands of years."<br/>

That, along with their resistence to many diseases prevelent in Eurasia, but the noodle thing in definitely the greater tragedy.<br/>
