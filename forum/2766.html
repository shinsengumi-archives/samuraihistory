 </span></blockquote>That's only fair, some of my newly arrived friends wanted to see some of <br/>
the real wild west, you know, like in the movies. Another couple was <br/>
disappointed that they would have to cross the country to see the Amish. <br/>
When I arrived the first time in Japan, I was a bit sad that it was so <br/>
Westernized. Too much chanbara ;)<br/>

 </span></blockquote>That's me, with no real way of finding out either. The US doesn't have <br/>
the records that Europe or Japan has. Possibly because in the US <br/>
citizenship is determined by where you are born and your parents <br/>
citizenship if you are born outside of the US. Unlike for example <br/>
Germany where 4th generation Turks are not citizens and people of German <br/>
ancestory can become German citizens quite rapidly. Same issues with <br/>
Koreans born in Japan.<br/>

><br/>
 </span></blockquote>NHK has a one year long series that usually historical in nature on <br/>
Sundays. They are high budget with famous actors. The current one that <br/>
just ended this week on NHK and TV Japan was Musashi. if you can rent <br/>
it, I recommend it. Hopefully they will come out with a six hour version <br/>
like some of the other dramas so people who missed it can see the <br/>
highlights.<br/>
<br/>
In San Francisco JTOWN there are a couple of rental stores that have TV <br/>
series same with San Jose, Sunnyvale, and Mountain View.<br/>
<br/>
The Santa Clara county library system has about 500 Japanese language <br/>
videos, a few that I've seen deal with Meiji, I haven't seen one that <br/>
deals directly with Saigo yet. If you live in California, you might be <br/>
able to get the videos via interlibrary loan. Otherwise you might have <br/>
to mail order from Japan which means no subtitles. A bit of a problem <br/>
for me if they have too much of an accent.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-174365810">I've had no problem with genealogical records in the USA.  There are plenty of <br/>
birth/death/marriage certificates back to about the 1840's or so, as well as <br/>
genealogical books that still hold records from even further back. I've been doing <br/>
my own genealogy for years, back to 16th century france.  My wife (who is <br/>
Japanese) is far, far more difficult, and we've only got back as far as her great-<br/>
great grandfather who was a samurai and advisor to the lord of the Ikeda clan of <br/>
Tottori.  Beyond that, I don't think the records exist, or if they do, it is VERY <br/>
hard to get them from the hands of the japanese government. I believe the records <br/>

> Why was Saigo Takamori's push for war with Korea<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>	I recommend "Saigo Takamori the man and the myth" by Yates. He <br/>
refreshingly suggests that Saigo had little intention of making war on <br/>
Korea and was simply doing his best to gain control of the council left <br/>
in charge in the absence of Okubo and others.<br/>
	He argues, I think convincingly, that Saigo had a history of placing <br/>
himself in danger to demonstrate his sincerity (makoto), and thereby <br/>
winning the trust of his enemies, forged alliances. This may have been <br/>
his intent when arguing for a mission to Korea. The Okubo led <br/>
government quashed the idea and later trumped up the image of a <br/>
"Hawkish, unreasonable" Saigo. Who quit the government not because of <br/>
the failure of the Korea mission but because he clearly saw who was now <br/>
in control and wanted no part of the administration under his old <br/>
friend.<br/>
	Not ten years after the Seinan no Ran, the emissary to Korea was <br/>
killed while on a mission there and this was used as an excuse by that <br/>
same Okubo government to annex the peninsula...<br/>

Saigo Takamori "the man behind the myth" by Charles Yates<br/>
(Kegan Paul 1995)<br/>
<br/>
A number of  good books were already listed such as "The Making of <br/>
Modern Japan"and others, there are also a number of "anecdotal" <br/>
collections culled from the recollections of foreign residents in <br/>
Yokohama and Tokyo as welll as from old newspaper accounts and the like.<br/>
<br/>
	Bob to answer your question the Yates book has some pretty detailed <br/>
accounts of the seinan no Ran, but nothing like "order of battle", <br/>
there are some good books in Japanese but I have yet to find a single <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-848573894">There is a book in Japanese about the battle of Tabaruzaka (I have a <br/>
photocopy of it).  There is a map in the front of the book showing the troops of both <br/>
sides.  I only know this because someone who knew Japanese told me what was on <br/>
the map.<br/>
<br/>
If anyone would like to take stab at translating this book (it's a little <br/>
over 200 pages) I'd be happy to send them a copy.<br/>

Japan Journal 1855-1861 by Henry Huesken (Rutgers 1964)<br/>
Choshu in the Meiji Restoration by Albert Craig (Harvard U. Press 1967)<br/>
The Culture of the Meiji Period by Daikichi Irokawa (Princeton U. 1985)<br/>
Sakamoto Ryoma and the Meiji Restoration by Marius Jansen<br/>
(Stanford 1961)<br/>
Saigo Takamori "the man behind the myth" by Charles Yates<br/>
(Kegan Paul 1995)<br/>
<br/>
A number of  good books were already listed such as "The Making of <br/>
Modern Japan"and others, there are also a number of "anecdotal" <br/>
collections culled from the recollections of foreign residents in <br/>
Yokohama and Tokyo as welll as from old newspaper accounts and the like.<br/>
<br/>
    Bob to answer your question the Yates book has some pretty detailed <br/>
accounts of the seinan no Ran, but nothing like "order of battle", <br/>
there are some good books in Japanese but I have yet to find a single <br/>
source with that kind of detail. Here's hopin someone on this list can <br/>
help us all out...<br/>
