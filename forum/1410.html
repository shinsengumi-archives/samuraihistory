ARMED MARTIAL ARTS OF JAPAN <br/>
Swordsmanship and Archery <br/>
G. C. Hurst III <br/>
<br/>
It goes into the history of the Japanese martial arts, how they <br/>
changed during the tokugawa period, and were 'sportified' (to use an <br/>
non-scholarly term) by westernization.  and coming from Yale, I have <br/>
to assume it will be a worthy read, and not, as some have termed, a <br/>
book of "martial-arts mythology".  If anyone has read it, I'd be <br/>
interested to hear about it.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>You need to get and read "Taming the Samurai" by Ikegami. The entire subject<br/>
of her book is just that very topic.<br/>
