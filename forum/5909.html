Akira Kurosawa never liked to repeat himself. True, "Yojimbo" (1961) <br/>
and "Tsubaki Sanjuro" (1962) were strikingly similar in the way the <br/>
crafty samurai hero (played in both films by Toshiro Mifune) <br/>
outwitted his enemies -- but Kurosawa made "Yojimbo" from an <br/>
original script, while "Tsubaki Sanjuro" was based on a novel by <br/>
Shugoro Yamamoto. Also, after these box-office successes, he put <br/>
Mifune's samurai -- his most popular creation -- into permanent <br/>
storage.<br/>
<br/>
By contrast, Kenji Misumi turned his 1962 hit about a blind <br/>
swordsman, "Zatoichi Monogatari," into a series that lasted 26 <br/>
episodes, one featuring a showdown between Zatoichi and Yojimbo <br/>
(which Kurosawa had nothing to do with whatsoever).<br/>
<br/>
Though a declared disciple of Kurosawa -- and corecipient of the <br/>
first-ever Akira Kurosawa Award for career achievement at this <br/>
year's Tokyo International Film Festival -- Yoji Yamada is more in <br/>
the spin-it-out-forever mold of Misumi. Best known for the 48 films <br/>
in his "Tora-san" series about a wandering peddler who is forever <br/>
falling in love, Yamada has directed or scripted several other <br/>
series in his four-decade-long career, including the "Tsuribaka <br/>
Nisshi (Free and Easy)" series about a fishing-crazy salaryman, now <br/>
in its 15th installment.<br/>
<br/>
Two years ago, Yamada released his first jidai geki (period drama) --<br/>
 "Tasogare Seibei (The Twilight Samurai)." Based on three novellas <br/>
by Shuhei Fujisawa, this portrait of a low-ranking samurai who was <br/>
both a devoted family man and a death-dealing swordsman swept the <br/>
Japanese Academy Awards and was nominated for a Best Foreign Film <br/>
Oscar.<br/>
<br/>
Given his track record, it's no surprise that Yamada's second period <br/>
drama is much like his first. "Oni no Tsume -- Kakushi Ken (The <br/>
Hidden Blade)" is not only based on two short stories by Fujisawa, <br/>
but also has a storyline similar to that of "Tasogare Seibei."<br/>
<br/>
Once again the hero, Katagiri Munezo (Masatoshi Nagase), is the <br/>
samurai equivalent of a hira (rank-and-file) salaryman, scraping by <br/>
on 30 koku (bales of rice) a year. Once again he is a dab hand with <br/>
a sword, having learned the deadly kakushiken (hidden blade) <br/>
technique from his fencing teacher. And once again the hero falls in <br/>
love with a woman, the lovely family servant Kie (Takako Matsu), <br/>
whom he considers untouchable (not unsuitable) because of the class <br/>
difference between them. (The platonic love of ["Twilight"] Seibei's <br/>
life was from a higher-ranking samurai family.)<br/>
<br/>
Yamada films this story in the same subdued and realistic, if <br/>
emotionally charged, style as "Tasogare." Instead of the dancelike <br/>
sword fights of so many jidai geki, though, the duels in "Oni no <br/>
Tsume" look sweaty, tiring and dangerous. Also, instead of the theme-<br/>
park appearance of so many jidai geki, with every kimono and fusuma <br/>
(sliding door) seemingly brand new, the clothes and sets in "Oni no <br/>
Tsume" have a lived-in, even worn-out, look. Meanwhile, the cast of <br/>
characters, particularly the lower classes, mostly look in need of a <br/>
long rest and a few good meals. The full-of-beans folks of so many <br/>
jidai geki, forever about to burst into song or dance are nowhere in <br/>
sight.<br/>
<br/>
"Oni no Tsume," however, is not a two-hour exercise in gloom and <br/>
doom. Serious though he may be, Yamada is first and foremost an <br/>
entertainer who is dedicated to giving his large audience what it <br/>
wants.<br/>
<br/>
So, what we get is an opening scene of two samurai friends, Katagiri <br/>
and Shimada Samon (Hidetaka Yoshioka), bidding a third, Hazama <br/>
Yachiro (Yukiyoshi Ozawa), goodbye at a riverbank as his boat leaves <br/>
for Edo (present-day Tokyo), where he intends to work for their clan <br/>
and seek his fortune.<br/>
<br/>
The two stay-at-homes, though sad, are not about to follow him. <br/>
Shimada is looking forward to his marriage to Katagiri's younger <br/>
sister Shino (Tomoko Tabata), while Katagiri is living contentedly <br/>
with his elderly mother and devoted servant-girl Kie.<br/>
<br/>
Three years pass. Katagiri's mother dies and Kie marries a son of <br/>
the Iseyas, prosperous oil sellers in town. Meanwhile, waves of <br/>
Westernization and political change are surging through the Tohoku <br/>
region -- and Katagiri's clan is not exempt. He starts to learn the <br/>
foreign arts of war (including how to fire a cannon without causing <br/>
major havoc to the people firing them). The age of the sword and <br/>
samurai is coming to an end.<br/>
<br/>
Then Katagiri learns that, far from the happy life he had imagined <br/>
for her, Kie has separated from her husband and is wasting away from <br/>
illness. He rescues her, brings her home, where he, Shino and Kie's <br/>
younger sister Bun slowly nurse her back to health. Meanwhile, her <br/>
feelings toward him change from gratitude to something more -- and <br/>
he finds himself wanting to reciprocate.<br/>
<br/>
But before Katagiri can properly celebrate Kie's recovery, more bad <br/>
news arrives: Hazama has been discovered leading a plot against the <br/>
clan leaders -- and has been imprisoned in a mountain hut instead of <br/>
being allowed to honorably commit seppuku like the other plotters. <br/>
Because Katagiri and Hazama trained at the same fencing school, <br/>
Katagiri's loyalty is doubted by the clan's wily karo (chief <br/>
retainer), Shogen Hori (Ken Ogata). How can he prove it -- while <br/>
staying true to himself?<br/>
<br/>
As Katagiri, Nagase is no longer the punkish rebel he played in <br/>
Yamada's 1991 father-and-son drama "Musuko (My Son)." Instead, here <br/>
he is closer to the modest-but-proud samurai Sanada Hiroyuki <br/>
portrayed in "Tasogare Seibei." But while the martial-arts-trained <br/>
Sanada impressed more with his sword skills, Nagase is more <br/>
convincingly the pacifist at heart who turns to violence only out of <br/>
extreme necessity -- but knows how to mete it out. The sense of <br/>
banked fires that can flare up, which Yamada deployed to good effect <br/>
in the earlier film, is still present, though Nagase, now pushing 40 <br/>
and no longer the wild kid, really seems to mean it when he says he <br/>
wants a quiet life with the woman he loves.<br/>
<br/>
When the world is going mad around you, carving out a small oasis of <br/>
sanity is no mean feat. Sometimes it helps to have a hidden blade.<br/>
