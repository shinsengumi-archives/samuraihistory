<div id="ygrps-yiv-1034834807">I just wanted to take some time to introduce myself, and <br/>
comment on how neat it is to know that there are groups here that <br/>
are interested in this topic.  I would like to know if there is <br/>
anyone who can assist me in researching my family name.I come from a <br/>
long line of samurai and my ancestors come from the Hiroshima <br/>
Prefecture, and Kamakura, I believe. My father had the opportunity <br/>
to be in Japan while he was in the Army after the Second World War <br/>
and visit our distant relatives. And had the privelige to see the <br/>
family tree in Hiroshima Prefecture.  I know that my name can be <br/>
traced back to about 800 years, and that they were samurai. My last <br/>
name is Kodama.  And from what my pop and grandparents have told me, <br/>
that it is indeed a very well respected name. Also, that my direct <br/>
ancestors were over 5feet 11 to 6 feet tall. Which is very unusual <br/>
for Japanese men.  ( I am 5'11 and 3/4 " tall.) That's about all for <br/>
now, but I look forward to hearing from you folk.<br/>
<br/>
Take care and God Bless<br/>

Welcome from another Army guy--I'm stationed in Tokyo<br/>
for the moment. Glad to have you aboard. <br/>
<br/>
As far as helping with your family tree, I know<br/>
Kitsuno, the owner of the list, has done some<br/>
extensive genealogical work, but mainly with the more<br/>
famous families (Oda, etc.). He does have some<br/>
resources that may benefit you though. He's been gone<br/>
recently, but maybe he'll poke his head out and say<br/>
something...<br/>

Not a bad name to have. The Kodama were ennobled after the Meiji Restoration. <br/>
There was a Baron Kodama Gentar√¥ who was at times War Minister, governor of <br/>
Formosa, and head honcho in Manchuria.<br/>

   Thank you for the intel.  My dad also spent time visiting <br/>
Kummamoto while he was stationed there back in 1947-1951.  <br/>
I look forward to hearing from Kitsuno-san.<br/>
Take care,<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1196916426">I don't really have any info for you, all of the genealogical <br/>
research I have done on sengoku era samurai comes exclusively from <br/>
japanese history books.  Look into www.ancestry.com, as well as any <br/>
LDS family history centers in your area.  Both helped a lot with my <br/>
own personal genealogy.<br/>
