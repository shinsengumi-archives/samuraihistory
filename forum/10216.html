<div id="ygrps-yiv-905087811">Hi All--<br/>
<br/>
Does anyone know (or can anyone point me to a good source) what specific buildings were destroyed in Kyoto during the Onin war?  What was the city like in the immediate aftermath?<br/>
<br/>
Thanks!<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-416482907">To my knowledge, no book in western language has been written on the subject of buildings destroyed during the Onin war. Maybe somme info can be gleaned in Varley "The Onin war" and Berry "The culture of civil war in Kyoto"<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-953183457">I do not know exactly what buildings were destroyed but much of Kyoto, especially warrior residential areas were laid to waste during the fighting because most of the early fighting took place in the streets of Kyoto and they were attacking each other's homes as well. The city itself really experienced a dark period. Think kind of like the image of the wild west, but set in medieval Japan. Murder, rape, robbery, kidnapping for ransom, famine were all common place in the immediate aftermath. In addition to the books already mentioned I would also suggest Kyoto in the Momoyama Period by Wendell Cole to see the long term effects of city being devastated. It might be tough to find, I got a used copy through Amazon, but if you can get it for a descent price it is worth reading to see how long lasting the effects of the Onin War itself, and the wide spread civil war that followed affected Kyoto.  <br/>

I do not know exactly what buildings were destroyed but much of Kyoto, especially warrior residential areas were laid to waste during the fighting because most of the early fighting took place in the streets of Kyoto and they were attacking each other's homes as well. The city itself really experienced a dark period. Think kind of like the image of the wild west, but set in medieval Japan. Murder, rape, robbery, kidnapping for ransom, famine were all common place in the immediate aftermath. In addition to the books already mentioned I would also suggest Kyoto in the Momoyama Period by Wendell Cole to see the long term effects of city being devastated.
