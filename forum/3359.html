Hey,<br/>
<br/>
I'm not sure where you guys have been hanging out, but in most of the areas <br/>
in Tokyo that I frequent (mostly Setagaya-ku) the beer machines have all <br/>
been taken out or shut down.  Some still exist outside of liquor stores, <br/>
but are shut off when the store closes.  I admit that I have seen some in <br/>
the "inaka" or in some back-alley parts of places like shita-machi, but it <br/>
seems the majority of them have been removed.<br/>
<br/>
Apologies for the non-samurai-related posting.<br/>

<br/>
Now there's talk about requiring all those "adult product" jid・hanbaiki to<br/>
require a check of a driver's license to make sure one's an adult. That <br/>
means us<br/>
"non Japanese DL toting gaijin" couldn't get booze late at night when we <br/>
need it...<br/>

Tony, as far as the ID goes, you know darn well that<br/>
konbini are on every freakin' corner, and you don't<br/>
need an ID there. Just stop at 7-11, Lawson's,<br/>
FamilyMart, Sunkuss, AmPm, or Circle K (am I<br/>
forgetting any?) to get your drink on at any hour.<br/>

they used to be. I've seen some here and there so far.<br/>
As for ID's, you hit the nail on the head--I was 19 my<br/>
whole year here as a ryuugakusei, and only got carded<br/>
once--and that wasn't for age, but to check what<br/>
country I was from! The bar only made gaijin show ID!<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Yeah, I turned 20 the day I landed in the US from<br/>
Japan after my year there. Kind of anti-climactic, and<br/>
THEN I had to wait another year to go out in the US!<br/>

"Modern Japan" message board, maybe we should get a<br/>
"Modern Japan" email list going. We've been doing a<br/>
lot of talking about Modern Japan (I know I'm probably<br/>
the worst offender, with my move and all) that might<br/>
should move. Dou omou?<br/>

Sawaguchi Yasuko, Sanma's teeth, which SMAP member(s) you'd like to <br/>
see hit by a car, which Japanese drama star's lingerie you'd like to <br/>
be reborn as, and anything else you care to think up that has some <br/>
sort of vague and tenuous relation to Japan. Inane banter is <br/>
encouraged."<br/>
