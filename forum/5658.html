Hart Takes On Samurai Girl <br/>
<br/>
Melissa Joan Hart has signed a deal with manga publisher TOKYOPOP to <br/>
produce and star in a film based on the Japanese comic book and <br/>
anime Samurai Girl: Real Bout High School, the company announced. <br/>
Dan Gordon (The Hurricane) will write the screenplay, which he <br/>
describes as Clueless meets Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon.<br/>
<br/>
The story centers around a twenty-something sushi-bar hostess who <br/>
discovers she is a reincarnated Samurai warrior and mankind's only <br/>
hope to save the world from a coven of monsters which hatch every <br/>
5,000 years, the company said.<br/>
<br/>
Hart's production company, Hartbreak Films, had been looking for a <br/>
project with a strong, dynamic female lead when Gordon brought them <br/>
the script. "Dan took a few weeks reading the material and then <br/>
delivered a story that had us sitting on the edges of our seats," <br/>
said executive producer Paula Hart. "It is smart, funny and terribly <br/>
exciting." TOKYOPOP and Hartbreak Films are now in conversations <br/>
with potential studio partners for the project.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>So if she is a reincarnation of a Samurai, does that make her a <br/>
modern samurai?</div>
