<h3>2 questions</h3>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1182106449">Hi,<br/>
    firstly i am after literature- published workd, or websites- containing <br/>
information on the life of Tokugawa Tsunayoshi (1680-1709). The fifth <br/>
Tokugawa Shogun. I am especially concerned with the protection of dogs that <br/>
his mother inspired, as well as the Urban culture during, and preceeding, <br/>
the Genroku Era (as well as any other information on this area, of which i <br/>
am particularly ignorant). Lastly, i would like to look into the Shohei <br/>
academy, of which Tsunayoshi was apparently the patron. Although, again, i <br/>
have no idea how long he remained appointed to this position.<br/>
    Secondly, and less specific;- Can anyone inform me as to whether ancient <br/>
Assyria would have contained modern Baghdad.<br/>
<br/>
  Any, and all help would be accepted with my full thanks<br/>
Miles R Dewey<br/>
