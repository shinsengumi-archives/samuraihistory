I'm writing my graduation thesis on Saigo Takamori.<br/>
Does anybody know why he was perdoned by Hisamitsu and recalled from <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-916075568">So, do you think that the growing anti-bakufu and anti-western <br/>
feelings (and the failure of koubo-gattai, of course) made Hisamitsu <br/>

So that influence was first the cause of Saigo's exile, and then the <br/>
cause of his appointment in Kyoto?<br/>

We don't have so much books in my University in Italy on this <br/>
subjec: I will look for Okubo biographies, but I don't think we got <br/>
something more than 'Craig & Shively, Personality in Japanese <br/>

<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-489663730">Fatty et al-<br/>
	During Saigo's exile on Okinoerabu-jima some important events <br/>
took place, Satsuma fought with the English, Katamori was placed in <br/>
charge of security in Kyoto by the bakufu and Choshu was involved in <br/>
actions that brought them to the fore. Katsura kogoro (Kido Koin) <br/>
acting for Choshu's interests was seen as a powerful personality <br/>
influencing the court and Satsuma Loyalists in the capitol saw <br/>
themselves as floundering and in need of a leader. They banded <br/>
together and pushed Hisamitsu to bring Saigo back or threatened group <br/>
suicide. Faced with their determination Hisamitsu gave permission for <br/>
them to petition the Han Government for his pardon.<br/>
<br/>
"Sayu mina kashiko nari to iu ka. Shikaraba sunawachi gumai no <br/>
Hisamitsu hitori kore wo saegiru no wa koron ni arazu. Yoroshiku <br/>
Taishiko no kessai wo koubeshi."<br/>
<br/>
"With everyone, left and right, saying this is just(wise). I, <br/>
Hisamitsu, would be blind or a fool to adhere to my own council. You <br/>
may submit your request to the Prime Minister (Taishiko)"<br/>
<br/>
	In this case the "Prime Minister" was Tadayoshi who was left <br/>
in charge of Han administration back in Satsuma. The story goes that <br/>
when Hisamitsu heard the news that Saigo was released he was so <br/>
angered by his men's loyalty to the charismatic Takamori, that he bit <br/>
firmly into his silver tobacco pipe leaving a deep mark...<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-760833918"><blockquote><span title="ireply">> Domenico,<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Thanks for the reference. Have been thinking more about anti-western <br/>
feeling in Satsuma and think I  need to look into it more. In 1864 <br/>
permission was sought to send young Satsuma samurai to London (as <br/>
Choshu did in 1863) to study Western technology and government. 16 <br/>
or more went to University College in 1865 (There are 16 in the photos <br/>
but I can't remember how many went.) I guess after the attack on <br/>
Kagoshima anti-western feeling would increase,  along with the <br/>
realisation that Japan could not defeat the West with contemporary <br/>
weapons and forces. So admiration of the west and a desire to know <br/>
more about them would also have been there. <br/>
<br/>
This was the position Katsura, Inoue and Takasugi had reached in <br/>
Choshu by 1862/3, a position not shared by the conservatives in the <br/>
han or the more radical loyalists. But what were Saigo's thoughts at this <br/>
time? I'd really like to know.<br/>

	My references are the Yates book, yes, though he has little <br/>
say on why he was recalled the second time, Gendai Shiten; <br/>
Sengoku-Bakumatsu Gunzo Saigo Takamori, other "Mooks" like the <br/>
Rekishi Gunzo series and Mushakoji Saneatsu's Dai Saigo from which we <br/>
get the story of Hisamitsu's pipe-stem...<br/>
	Having just looked at these references in trying to answer <br/>
the earlier question it seems that Saigo was in exile and maybe even <br/>
unaware during the British attacks on Kagoshima, it'll take some <br/>
deeper research to find out if he ever put down his thoughts. You <br/>
would be right though to say that there was respect and real <br/>
friendship born of the conflict between England and Satsuma. A <br/>
reading of the British accounts of the time I think will show how <br/>
bonds were formed between the two out of the negotiations that <br/>
followed the burning of Kagoshima. Some of this is off the top of my <br/>
head but is how I remember the seeds of British support for the <br/>
western han were planted.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1079710834">Hi Gillian,<br/>
That's what I've found in Yates book:<br/>
<br/>
In 1863-64 Saigo was clued up of Western danger: he was aware that <br/>
if the han were busy fighting each other the country would be more <br/>
vulnerable. But he was not yet thinking of Japan as a single entity, <br/>
because he was grown up in domestic politics. Only after his meeting <br/>
with Katsu Kaishuu ('Saigou Takamori Zenshuu', Tokyo, Daiwa Shobou, <br/>
vol. I, pp. 396-403) he began to think about a Choshu-Satsuma <br/>
cooperation with the foreign powers against bakufu.<br/>
<br/>
I hope to find something more on this argument going on with my <br/>
studies.<br/>
The meeting with Katsu seems to have irrevocably altered Saigo's <br/>
thoughts. Do you know something more about him?<br/>

<br/>
My Dictionary of Modern Japanese History has the following:<br/>
<br/>
1823-1899<br/>
native of Edo and bakufu retainer, K trained in Dutch studies and <br/>
Western military science. In 1855 he became an official translator of <br/>
Western books then a naval student at Nagasaki. 1860 captained the <br/>
Kanrinmaru on first Japanese crossing of Pacific.On his return taught <br/>
gunnery and naval affairs and established first naval school at Hyogo in <br/>
1863, Built up bakufu navy. Students came from different han - one <br/>
was Sakamoto (who legend has it went to assassinate Katsu but ended <br/>
up an ardent disciple). This was the start of Katsu's strong contacts <br/>
with the loyalists. The degree of modernisation which he propounded <br/>
and the divergence of his views from many servants of the bakufu led <br/>
conservatives to press for his dismissal in 1864, but was restored to <br/>
favour under Tokugawa keiki and served as major contact with <br/>
bakufu's opponents. In 1868 negotiated with Saigo for peacefull <br/>
surrender of Edo. Acted as deputy navy minister for new regime 1872<br/>
-73 and in various other government posts. Wrote histories of army, <br/>
navy, bakufu, opening of country and memoirs.<br/>
<br/>
(which I would like to read!)<br/>
<br/>
One time I was in Japan I saw a "Sonotoki" documentary on him which <br/>
might still be in the NHK website archives.<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I can't answer this with any great authority but my instinct is "Yes", <br/>
given Katsu's obvious intelligence and charisma. In 9/64 Craig (Choshu <br/>
in the Meiji Restoration p312) says Saigo and Katsu discussed  the <br/>
impotence and temporising of the bakufu. Also I think all  the future <br/>
Meiji leaders shared characteristics of flexibility, pragmatism, even <br/>
opportunism which along with their undeniable physical and mental <br/>
toughness enabled them to survive the turbulent bakumatsu years <br/>
when so many more stubborn and unyielding personalities went under.<br/>
(see Craig. p 268)<br/>
<br/>
There was a lot of confusion (understatement!) in the bakumatsu <br/>
period and decisions were often made on emotional and instinctive <br/>
grounds. Craig quotes Ito Hirobumi: "if one speaks logically of the <br/>
things (that happened then) they are impossible to understand...but <br/>
emotionally it had to be that way." (op cit.p198)<br/>
<br/>
(rather like the argument that going to war should be like jumping off <br/>
the veranda.)<br/>
<br/>
Perhaps  Saigo's personality in the end proved too "strong" to be able <br/>
to accommodate the drive to modernism of the Meiji government: <br/>
hence his last stand as "last samurai" .<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> > Thank you for everything<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>No problem, I enjoy discussing these things, it helps me clarify my <br/>
thoughts.<br/>
<br/>
 and once more sorry for my English...<br/>
<br/>
Don't apologise for your English: it is brilliant.<br/>
<br/>
Cheers,<br/>

recently.  They are:<br/>
<br/>
    "Saigo Takamori: The Many Behind the Myth", by Charles L. Yates, Kegan <br/>
Paul International Ltd, 1995.<br/>

    Could you please clarify your response a little.  Are you saying that <br/>
there's no such thing as Bushido?  Or that there is no codification of Bushido <br/>
(sort of like the Code of the West, it exits but in an unwritten form).  Or that <br/>
there is no English translation of the Code of Bushido?<br/>
<br/>
    Thanks.<br/>
<br/>

 <br/>
What do you mean by writing,"There is no such thing"? An english translation perhaps?<br/>
Any copy of the Code published for market?<br/>
