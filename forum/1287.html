<h3>Re: will adams...</h3>

<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1955865723">Hi Gabs - <br/>
<br/>
Clavell based his book - very loosely - on real events, <br/>
Blackthorne is Will Adams, Lord Toranaga is Tokugawa Ieyasu and <br/>
the battle at the end was Sekigahara.<br/>
<br/>
That aside, the book is written for the western reader with <br/>
little or no knowledge of Japan and samurai culture, and most <br/>
of what's written owes more to fantasy that fact, reinforcing <br/>
the commonly held and erroneous notion of the samurai. It's a <br/>
good read if mostly nonsense, although some find it insulting <br/>
and playing up to the idea of the 'exotic orient'.<br/>
<br/>
Ieyasu was a very patient, vcery diplomatic, very skillful <br/>
leader who knew his own mind and exactly what he wanted and <br/>
how he was going to do it.<br/>
<br/>
History suggests he would listen at length to the council of <br/>
his hatamoto, and then do precisely what he intended all along. <br/>
Whilst he and Adams did become friends of sorts, I reckon it <br/>
<br/>
was always on the basis that Adams was such an outsider that he <br/>
could pose no threat as such. I doubt whether Adams ever got a <br/>
grip of the convoluted politics of Sengoku Japan, let alone the <br/>
deeper workings of Ieyasu's mind. <br/>
<br/>
Regardless of what Adams thought of the Jesuits, Ieyasu played <br/>
his own game, and if anything Adams would have supplied the <br/>
information Ieyasu wanted to make a case for or against.<br/>
<br/>
In short, his closest retainers rarely knew what was in his <br/>
mind, and I doubt any opinion Adams might have held would have <br/>
swayed him one iota.<br/>
<br/>
As far as I know, Adams was the only foreigner to make the rank <br/>
of samurai, let alone hatamoto.<br/>
<br/>
If you're really interested get hold of "The Needle-Watcher" by<br/>
Richard Blaker, a fictional biography of Adams and much, much <br/>
more accurate.<br/>

<h3>Re: [samuraihistory] will adams...</h3>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-389628216">Hi Gabs<br/>
<br/>
Will Adams is an interesting subject, not only was he reputed to be the first North European on Japanese soil and that he became Samurai but he wrote a number of letters describing his "adventure" and many survived... You can view one at <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.fordham.edu/halsall/mod/1611adams-japan.html">http://www.fordham.edu/halsall/mod/1611adams-japan.html</a> although this has been "cleaned" to make it readable. There are many books detailing his life based on the letters as well as Faction Novels (such as Clavell's Shogun) and more than a few fictional works. Apart from various sources for copies of his letters, I have an early "Romantic Biography" published 1860 - entitled "Will Adams, The First Englishman in Japan" by William Dalton. Dalton "fills-in" between the letters and with some other sources makes quite an entertaining read. Will Adams is also covered in one of the chapters in Herbert H. Gowen's work "Five Foreigners in Japan" which is quite a factual approach... As an aside, one of the other chapters relates to a native american (although born under the British Flag) visiting Japan in 1848, he was named - Ranald MacDonald. - worth many hours of fun on that name!!<br/>
<br/>
So back to Clavell.... There was a book published on the making of the film "Shogun"... "The Making of James Clavell's Shogun" ISBN 0 340 26155 2, which gives a fascinating insight into the novel and the story.<br/>
<br/>
Regarding other foreigners... Papinot lists many "principal foreigners" in his supplement to his "Historical and Geographical Dictionary of Japan" but none appear to have been accepted into japanese society as samurai. Most appear to have lost their lives in one or other tortuous ways!! <br/>
<br/>
Good luck with the searching,<br/>

  Do you think that Will Adams was the real life model of John Blackthorne in James Clavell's 'Shogun?'  The similarities are striking:  Adams came to Japan aboard a Dutch vessel, his chemistry w/ Ieyasu/Toranaga was very good and eventually both were conferrred samurai rank and were not permitted to leave Japan.<br/>

<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-328719729">Hosokawa Gracia was the wife of the daimyo Hosokawa Tadaoki, a strong <br/>
Tokugawa supporter.<br/>
She was also the daughter of Akechi Mitsuhide, the retainer of Nobunaga <br/>
who revolted, killed<br/>
Nobunaga, and was defeated by Hideyoshi shortly thereafter.<br/>
<br/>
Gracia converted to Christianity against the wishes of her husband who <br/>
threatened to kill her<br/>
unless she recanted.   She refused and he apparently relented.    She <br/>
was known for her great<br/>
intelligence, learning and beauty.   She was described by the Jesuits as <br/>
fluent in Latin and<br/>
Portuguese and of extraordinary piety.  <br/>
<br/>
There is an account of her death in Sadler's "The Maker of Modern <br/>
Japan."  In brief, it says that<br/>
one of Hosokawa's retainers killed Gracia to prevent her from being <br/>
taken hostage by the<br/>
Toyotomi forces prior to the Sekigahara campaign.  <br/>
<br/>
Although James Clavell used her as the model for Toda Mariko,  there is <br/>
no record of<br/>
Gracia having met Will Adams, much less having an affair with him.   <br/>
Unfortunately there<br/>
is little information about her available outside of Japan.   She was at <br/>
least as interesting<br/>
as the many famous men of that period.<br/>
